RE: Saltwater  Disposal  Well Reporting  and Monitoring  Requirements
Dear Saltwater  Disposal  Operator:
This letter is to outline and clarify the Commission’s  requirements  for monthly  reporting  and
monitoring  of saltwater  disposal wells which are outlined under North Dakota Administrative
Code (NDAC) Section 43-02-05-12,  and the type of wastes that can be injected pursuant  to the
EPA guidelines  for Exempt  and Non-Exempt  Oil and Gas Exploration  and Production  Wastes.
All injection  into a saltwater  disposal  well must be measured,  either through  a meter or by an
approved  method. Accurate  gauges must be placed on the tubing and tubing-casing  annulus  of the
well for pressure  monitoring.  Any noncompliance  with regulations  or permit conditions  must be
reported to the Commission  orally within 24 hours followed by a written explanation  within 5
days.
Monthly  reporting  of the following  information  is required  to be submitted  for a saltwater
disposal  well on a Saltwater  Disposal  Report  (Form 16):
Beginning  and end of month  meter readings.
Total barrels injected  for the month.
Average  daily operating  injection  pressure  (this means  a typical pressure  observed  while
the well is injecting,  not a mathematical  average).
4. Sources of received fluid (these sources need to be listed by well or facility name and
number, NDIC well or facility file number, and the location of each source by
quarter-quarter,  section,  township,  and range).
5. Amount  of fluid received  from each source.
Nature  of the received  fluid (i.e. produced  water, pit water, etc.).
7. Transportation  method used to transport  the injection  fluid to the disposal  well site (i.e.
pipeline  or truck).WN
a
Saltwater  Disposal Reports (Form 16) are due on or before the fifth day of the second month
succeeding  the month in which the well is capable of disposal  (i.e. January  report due March 5th).
Pursuant  to NDAC Section 43-02-05-13.1,  all records from which to make and substantiate
required  reports shall be kept for a period of not less than six years.

Saltwater  Disposal  Well Reporting  and Monitoring  Requirements
Page 2 of 2
The NDIC abides by the Environmental  Protection Agency guidelines for Exempt and
Non-Exempt  Oil and Gas Exploration  and Production  Wastes to determine  what wastes can be
accepted  for disposal  from oil and gas exploration  and production  operations. Attached  is an
example  list of exempt  and non-exempt  oil and gas exploration  and production  wastes along with a
flow chart for determining  the status of a waste.
The operator  is only authorized  to inject Class JI fluids into a saltwater  disposal  well. Class
II fluids are generally  defined  as follows:
1. Produced  water from oil and gas production.
2. Waste fluids from actual drilling  operations.
3. Used workover,  completion,  and stimulation  fluids recovered  from production,  injection,
and exploratory  wells.
4. Waste fluids from circulation  during  well cementing.
Pigging  fluids from cleaning  of collection  and injection  lines within  the field.
Enhanced  recovery  waters including  fresh water makeup  and other waters containing
chemicals  for the purpose  of enhanced  recovery.
Gases used for enhanced  recovery/pressure  maintenance  of production  reservoirs.
Brine reject from water  softeners  associated  with enhanced  recovery.
Waste oil and fluids from clean up within  the oil field.
0. Waste water from gas plants which are an integral  part of production  operations  unless
those waters  are classified  as hazardous  waste at the time of injection.nim
~8Sn
The following  fluids are non-exempt  fluids and are not authorized  to be injected  into a Class
II saltwater  disposal  well:
Unused  fracturing  fluids or acids.
Vacuum  truck and drum rinsate  from trucks and drums  containing  non-exempt  waste.
Refined  gasoline  or diesel fuels.
Used equipment  lubricating  oils.
Refinery  wastes.
Radioactive  tracer wastes.
Car wash wastes.NAMBWN>
Please distribute  this letter and the attachment  to the appropriate  personnel  responsible  for
reporting  on and monitoring  each saltwater  disposal  well your company  operates. If you have any
questions,  do not hesitate  to contact  me.
Sincerely,
Ashleigh  Day
Underground  Injection  Supervisor

Statement  of corrective  action required  for wells within  the % mile area of review
There are no existing  wells within % mile of the proposed  Atlanta  #1 SWD. However,  all fourteen
producing  wells drilled on the Atlanta  pad will have identical  cementing  programs  for their 7”
intermediate  casing. The cement  will be pumped  to the surface,  and will provide  complete  coverage
across  the proposed  Dakota injection  interval.

Atlanta  #1 SWD
Sec 6-T153N-R101W
Williams  County,  ND
Description  of the proposed  injection  program
Continental  Resources  proposes  to drill and complete  the Atlanta  #1 SWD in the Dakota  formation
(5450’  — 5900’) in Sec 6-T153N-R101W  of Williams  County,  ND. This SWD well will service  the fourteen
wells that will be drilled on the pad. Seven of the wells will be completed  in the Bakken  and seven of the
wells will be completed  in the Three Forks.
The produced  water  will be cycled through  6 - 750 bbi tanks and filtered  prior to being injected.  The
Atlanta  #1 SWD will receive  the produced  water  from a buried  steel line connected  to the disposal
pumps. The facility  will be equipped  with emergency  shutdown  equipment  and an automated  callout
system.

Subject:  RE: Atlanta  #1 SWD Information
Stephen,
In regards  to 1 below, we did send notice to more than we were supposed  to. What we did was actually
send out notifications  to all landowners  within % mile of the entire pad and not just the location  of the
SWD well. Because  of this, we notified close to % mile out from the SWD instead of the required  % mile
radius. | talked with our land operations  coordinator  Chad Newby and he stated that Wilbert  & irene
Koch were located outside of the % mile radius that we were required  to notify but were located within
a % mile of the outside  boundary  of the entire Atlanta pad.
Please let me know if you need a map showing  where they are located or if this email will suffice. Sorry
if our over-notification  caused any headaches.
We are working  on getting an updated diagram  for the berm and should have it to you early next week.
Thanks,

Stephen,
Attached,  | believe, is everything  that you requested  regarding  additional  information  needed for the
Atlanta #1 SWD proposed  well. Please let me know if you need anything  else.
In addition,  all cuttings  from the well will be containerized  and hauled to Indian Hills Disposal instead of
using a pit.
Thanks  again for all your help,
