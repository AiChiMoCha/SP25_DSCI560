of Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives have managed to keep up to date. The book 
has an applied approach. It is a very popular college text, but it can also be found on trading-room desks throughout the world. (Indeed, I receive emails from derivatives practitioners about the book almost every day.) The blending of material useful for practitioners with material appropriate for university courses is what makes the book unique.PREFACE
NEW TO THIS EDITION
 •A major change in financial markets will be the phase-out of LIBOR. This has led to important changes throughout the 11th edition. The overnight reference rates that will replace LIBOR, and the way they are used to determine zero  
curves, are discussed carefully.
 •Within-chapter examples and end-of-chapter problems that were previously based on LIBOR have been largely replaced by examples based on the new reference rates or by generic examples.
 •The likely impact of the new reference rates on valuation models is discussed.
 •The new reference rates are considered to be risk-free whereas LIBOR incorporates a time-varying credit spread. The book discusses the desire on the part of banks to augment the new reference rates with a measure of the level of credit spreads in the market.
 •The chapter on Wiener processes now covers fractional Brownian motion. This is becoming increasingly used in modeling volatility.
 •Rough volatility models which have in the last few years been found to fit volatility surfaces well are added to the models considered in Chapter 27.
 •Machine learning is becoming increasingly used in pricing and hedging deriva- tives. The reader is introduced to these applications at various points in the book.
 •Changes in the regulatory environment, including Basel IV , are covered.
 •The end-of-chapter problems have been updated. To make the book as easy to  
use as possible, solutions to all end-of-chapter problems are now on www .pearsonglobaleditions.com and www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull.
A01_HULL0654_11_GE_FM.indd   17 03/05/2021   14:5218 Preface 
 •Instructor support material has been revised. In particular, there are now many 
more suggestions on assignment questions that can be used in conjunction with chapters.
 •The DerivaGem software is less LIBOR-focused and is available for download from www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull/software.
 •Tables, charts, market data, and examples have been updated throughout the book.
SOLVING TEACHING AND LEARNING CHALLENGES
Most instructors find that courses in derivatives are fun to teach. There is not a big gap between theory and practice. Most students know a little about the subject and are motivated to learn more. Usually there is some current news that can be discussed in class, e.g., the level of the VIX index or events that affect particular option prices.
Math Knowledge
Math is the key challenge for many students taking a course in derivatives. I have kept this in mind in the way material is presented throughout the book. Instructors are often faced with a trade-off between mathematical rigor and the simplicity with which an idea  
is explained. My preference is always to look for the simplest way of explaining an idea  
in the first instance. Sometimes using words rather than equations is effective. I avoid using notation that has lots of subscripts, superscripts, and function arguments as far as  
possible because this can be off-putting to a reader who is new to the material.  
Nonessential mathematical material has been either eliminated or included in technical notes on my website.
The reality is that many students only understand an equation when they have seen 
numbers substituted into it. For that reason, many numerical examples have been included in the text. The software DerivaGem (discussed below) allows students to  
get a feel for equations by trying different inputs.
I am often asked about the math prerequisites for Options, Futures and Other  
Derivatives. Students will be able to cope with a course based on this book if they  
are comfortable with algebra and understand probabilities and probability distribu-tions. A knowledge of calculus concepts is useful for parts of the book. But no knowledge of stochastic calculus is assumed. The basic knowledge of stochastic  
processes that is needed for a more advanced understanding of derivatives is explained carefully in Chapter 14.
End of Chapter Problems
As in earlier editions, there are many other end-of-chapter problems to help students apply the ideas presented in the chapters. These have been updated. The distinction between “prac-tice questions” and “further questions” has been eliminated. Answers to all end-of-chapter  
problems are on my website and available through www.pearsonglobaleditions.com.

Designing a Course
There are many ways in which the material in the book can be used. Instructors  
teaching an introductory course in derivatives tend to spend most time on the first  
20 chapters, and often choose to omit Chapter 14 and Section 15.6. Instructors teaching  
a more advanced course find that many different combinations of chapters in the  
second half of the book can be used. I find that Chapter 37 is a fun chapter that works 
well at the end of either an introductory or an advanced course.
Software
The DerivaGem software is an important part of the book. Students get comfortable with the models presented in the book when they use DerivaGem to value transactions under different assumptions. The use of the software is explained at the end of the book. 
I recommend giving students assignments that involve using the basic DG400a.xls 
software. There are many types of assignments that can be developed. For example, students can be asked to compare American or European option prices given by a binomial model with those from the Black–Scholes–Merton model. They can be asked to report what happens as the number of time steps is increased in a binomial model and can use the software to display trees. (DerivaGem can display trees with up to  
10 time steps and can calculate prices and Greek letters using up to 500 time steps.)
Many charts can be produced using the software and students can include those 
charts in reports produced for the instructor. The calculation of zero curves and swap valuation is made easy with DerivaGem. I like to use DerivaGem in class when I  
illustrate some key concepts.
Students taking a more advanced course in derivatives can be asked to compare 
prices given by different models using the Alternative Models worksheet in DG400a.xls.  
Alternatives to Black–Scholes that are covered include CEV , Merton mixed jump– diffusion, variance gamma, Heston, and SABR. Students can also be asked to carry  
out assignments concerned with the use of different models for pricing bond options. The CDS and CDO worksheets can be used in conjunction with each other for an assignment if CDOs are covered.
DerivaGem can be used in conjunction with current market data that can be down- 
loaded from Yahoo Finance or other providers. For example, students can be asked to  
compare implied volatilities for options on different stocks that have been in the news. They can also be asked to calculate volatility term structures and volatility smiles for stock indices. Assignments such as these can be important because they make the underlying concepts more “real” and lead to interesting classroom discussions.
The DG400 Applications software enables students to carry out assignments where 
they are asked investigate issues such as how the performance of delta hedging is improved as the interval between rebalancing is decreased or how managing gamma  
can improve the performance of delta hedging. Assuming students have a basic  
knowledge of Excel, they should have no difficulty using this software and changing instructions as necessary.
The DG400 Functions software is a little more challenging. It contains the functions 
used by DG400a.xls. Students can use these functions to develop their own Excel work-sheets in order to investigate particular issues and answer assignment questions.
Many instructors find DerivaGem to be a really useful resource. DerivaGem can be 
downloaded from www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull/software.

EMPLOYABILITY
A natural question for students is: “Will a course in derivatives improve my chances of  
a getting a job in finance?” The answer is an overwhelming yes. Probably the first thing  
many students think about when considering options or other derivatives is an  
exchange such as the CBOE. In fact, as Chapter 1 makes clear, the over-the-counter (OTC) market is much larger than the exchange-traded market and likely to be much more important to students in their first job (or subsequent jobs). Options, Futures, and  
Other Derivatives has a much bigger focus on the OTC market than most other  
derivatives texts.
Derivatives have steadily increased in importance. Potential employers can be  
classified as “buy side” and “sell side” . The buy side includes nonfinancial corpora- tions, insurance companies, fund managers, and some other financial institutions. The  
sell side consists of large financial institutions who act as market makers. Many  
students who take courses in derivatives may not become derivatives traders or  
derivatives analysts. However, derivatives now permeate all aspects of finance. If you work in investment banking, there is likely to be a derivatives component to some of the  
deals you are involved in; if you work in fund management, you will probably find  
derivatives to be convenient tools for some purposes; if you work for a nonfinancial  
corporation, you may be involved in using derivative contracts for hedging and  
negotiating with a sell-side institution; and so on. Whatever your role in finance, it is  
important that you be able to talk about derivatives knowledgeably, use the right  
words, and understand the motivations of a counterparty to a transaction. A course based on Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives will help you do this.
What about those of you who want to specialize in derivatives? I have literally lost 
count of the many successful derivative executives who have told me “Thank you for your book. I read it before the interview, and it got me my first job in derivatives. ” (My joking response has typically been: “Great, but you realize that means you owe me 20% of your first year’s salary. ”) The people I am talking about typically had engineering, physics, or other quantitative backgrounds at the time of the interview but had never taken a course in finance! So, while the book is important for those planning a career in finance, it is absolutely essential reading for all those aspiring to a career in derivatives. As mentioned earlier, it is found on trading-room desks throughout the world.
This book will help you develop your quant skills so that you become more market- 
able in finance. But other skills are of course important. Good communication skills are  
A01_HULL0654_11_GE_FM.indd   20 03/05/2021   14:52Preface 21
necessary. Many instructors ask students to present the results of projects in class.  
Students should take full advantage of these opportunities to practice and improve. If 
presentations are recorded, they should review the recording carefully.
At my business school, we used to run optional mock interviews and other self- 
development activities for students. Interestingly, the students that took advantage of them tended to be the ones that already had fairly good skills. The students that really needed help did not participate. (We have since made the activities mandatory.) I would urge all students to take advantage of all opportunities to improve their soft skills. Do not dismiss them as unimportant.
What are other important skills? The book discusses the regulatory environment for  
derivatives which changed a lot following the 2008 financial crisis. Make sure you understand the issues and are familiar with the latest developments. You should also use a derivatives course to help develop your critical thinking skills. Ask questions in class and do not be afraid to express an opinion about an issue.
A potential employer will want to be convinced that you can work well with others. 
While at university you will be involved in many group projects and should take this opportunity to develop good collaboration skills. You may find some members of your group difficult to work with, but this is also likely to be true in your first full-time job.  
Go to an interview prepared to talk about your experiences working with other students.
In addition to quant skills and knowledge of derivatives, I have mentioned that  
communication skills, the ability to work collaboratively, and critical thinking are soft skills that you should try and develop to make sure you get that first job. Another  
I might add is social responsibility. It is not an accident that most successful corporate  
executives are actively involved in community activities. Be prepared to talk about sustainable finance, which is an aspect of social responsibility and becoming an  
increasingly important area within finance.

In the last 40 years, derivatives have become increasingly important in finance. Futures 
and options are actively traded on many exchanges throughout the world. Many  
different types of forward contracts, swaps, options, and other derivatives are entered into by financial institutions, fund managers, and corporate treasurers in the over-the-counter market. Derivatives are added to bond issues, used in executive compensation plans, embedded in capital investment opportunities, used to transfer risks in mortgages from the original lenders to investors, and so on. We have now reached the stage where those who work in finance, and many who work outside finance, need to understand how derivatives work, how they are used, and how they are priced.
Whether you love derivatives or hate them, you cannot ignore them! The derivatives 
market is huge—much bigger than the stock market when measured in terms of  
underlying assets. The value of the assets underlying outstanding derivatives trans-actions is several times the world gross domestic product. As we shall see in this chapter, derivatives can be used for hedging or speculation or arbitrage. They can transfer a wide range of risks in the economy from one entity to another.
A derivative involves two parties agreeing to a future tranasaction. Its value depends 
on (or derives from) the values of other underlying variables. Very often the variables underlying derivatives are the prices of traded assets. A stock option, for example, is a derivative whose value is dependent on the price of a stock. However, derivatives can be dependent on almost any variable, from the price of hogs to the amount of snow falling at a certain ski resort.
Since the first edition of this book was published in 1988 there have been many 
developments in derivatives markets. For example:
• Many new instruments such as credit derivatives, electricity derivatives, weather derivatives, and insurance derivatives have been developed.
• Many new types of interest rate, foreign exchange, and equity derivatives now 
trade.
• There have been many new ideas in risk management and risk measurement.
• Real option methods for capital investment appraisal have been developed.
• The financial crisis of 2008 occurred, with derivatives (perhaps unfairly) getting much of the blame.Introduction1 CHAPTER  
M01_HULL0654_11_GE_C01.indd   23 30/04/2021   16:3824 CHAPTER 1
• Many regulations affecting the over-the-counter derivatives market have been 
introduced.
• The “risk-free” discount rate used to value derivatives has changed and the  
decision has been taken to phase out LIBOR.
• Derivatives dealers now adjust the way they price derivatives to allow for credit risks, funding costs, and capital requirements.
• Collateral and credit issues are now given much more attention and have led to changes in the way derivatives are traded.
• Machine learning is now becoming widely used for managing derivatives  
portfolios.
The book has evolved to keep up to date with these developments. For example: the 
2008 financial crisis is discussed in Chapter 8; changes in the interest rates used for derivatives pricing are discussed in Chapter 4; valuation adjustments are covered in Chapter 9; real options are explained in Chapter 36; credit derivatives are covered in Chapter 25; energy, weather, and insurance derivatives are covered in Chapter 35. Machine learning applications are discussed at various points in the book.
In this opening chapter, we take a first look at derivatives markets and how they are 
changing. We contrast exchange-traded and over-the-counter derivatives markets and review recent regulatory changes affecting the markets. We describe forward, futures, and options markets and provide examples of how they are used by hedgers, specu-lators, and arbitrageurs. Later in the book we will elaborate on many of the points  
made in this chapter.
A derivatives exchange is a market where individuals and companies trade standard-
ized contracts that have been defined by the exchange. Derivatives exchanges have existed for a long time. The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) was established in 1848 to bring farmers and merchants together. Initially its main task was to standardize the quantities and qualities of the grains that were traded. Within a few years, the first futures-type contract was developed. It was known as a to-arrive contract.  
Speculators soon became interested in the contract and found trading the contract to be an attractive alternative to trading the grain itself. A rival futures exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), was established in 1919. Now futures ex -
changes exist all over the world. (See table at the end of the book.) The CME  
and CBOT have merged to form the CME Group (www.cmegroup.com), which also includes the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), and the Kansas City Board of Trade (KCBT).
The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE, www.cboe.com) started trading call 
option contracts on 16 stocks in 1973. Options had traded prior to 1973, but the CBOE succeeded in creating an orderly market with well-defined contracts. Put option  
contracts started trading on the exchange in 1977. The CBOE now trades options on thousands of stocks and many different stock indices. Like futures, options have proved to be very popular contracts. Many other exchanges throughout the world now trade 1.1 EXCHANGE-TRADED MARKETS
M01_HULL0654_11_GE_C01.indd   24 30/04/2021   16:38Introduction 25
options. (See table at the end of the book.) The underlying assets include foreign 
currencies and futures contracts as well as stocks and stock indices.
Once two traders have agreed to trade a product offered by an exchange, it is handled 
by the exchange clearing house. This stands between the two traders and manages the risks. Suppose, for example, that trader A enters into a futures contract to buy  
100 ounces of gold from trader B in six months for $1,750 per ounce. The result of this trade will be that A has a contract to buy 100 ounces of gold from the clearing house at $1,750 per ounce in six months and B has a contract to sell 100 ounces of gold to the clearing house for $1,750 per ounce in six months. The advantage of this  
arrangement is that traders do not have to worry about the creditworthiness of the people they are trading with. The clearing house takes care of credit risk by requiring each of the two traders to deposit funds (known as margin) with the clearing house to ensure that they will live up to their obligations. Margin requirements and the operation of clearing houses are discussed in more detail in Chapter 2.
Electronic Markets
Traditionally derivatives exchanges have used what is known as the open outcry system. This involves traders physically meeting on the floor of the exchange, shouting, and using a complicated set of hand signals to indicate the trades they would like to carry out. Exchanges have largely replaced the open outcry system by electronic trading. This involves traders entering their desired trades at a keyboard and a computer being used to match buyers and sellers. The open outcry system has its advocates, but, as time passes, it is becoming less and less used.
Electronic trading has led to a growth in high-frequency trading. This involves the 
use of algorithms to initiate trades, often without human intervention, and has become an important feature of derivatives markets.
Not all derivatives trading is on exchanges. Many trades take place in the over-the-
counter (OTC) market. Banks, other large financial institutions, fund managers, and corporations are the main participants in OTC derivatives markets. Once an OTC trade has been agreed, the two parties can either present it to a central counterparty (CCP) or clear the trade bilaterally. A CCP is like an exchange clearing house. It stands between the two parties to the derivatives transaction so that one party does not have to bear the risk that the other party will default. When trades are cleared  
bilaterally, the two parties have usually signed an agreement covering all their trans-actions with each other. The issues covered in the agreement include the circumstances under which outstanding transactions can be terminated, how settlement amounts are calculated in the event of a termination, and how the collateral (if any) that must be posted by each side is calculated. CCPs and bilateral clearing are discussed in more detail in Chapter 2.
Large banks often act as market makers for the more commonly traded instruments. 
This means that they are always prepared to quote a bid price (at which they are  
prepared to take one side of a derivatives transaction) and an ask price (at which they are prepared to take the other side).1.2 OVER-THE-COUNTER MARKETS
M01_HULL0654_11_GE_C01.indd   25 30/04/2021   16:3826 CHAPTER 1
Prior to the financial crisis, which started in 2007 and is discussed in some detail in 
Chapter 8, OTC derivatives markets were largely unregulated. Following the financial 
crisis and the failure of Lehman Brothers (see Business Snapshot 1. 1), we have seen the 
development of many new regulations affecting the operation of OTC markets. The main objectives of the regulations are to improve the transparency of OTC markets and reduce systemic risk (see Business Snapshot 1.2). The over-the-counter market in some 
respects is being forced to become more like the exchange-traded market. Three  
important changes are:
1. Standardized OTC derivatives between two financial institutions in the United States must, whenever possible, be traded on what are referred to a swap execution  
facilities (SEFs). These are platforms similar to exchanges where market  
participants can post bid and ask quotes and where market participants can  
trade by accepting the quotes of other market participants.
2. There is a requirement in most parts of the world that a CCP be used for most 
standardized derivatives transactions between financial institutions.
3. All trades must be reported to a central repository.Business Snapshot 1.1 The Lehman Bankruptcy
On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. This was the largest 
bankruptcy in U.S. history and its ramifications were felt throughout derivatives markets. Almost until the end, it seemed as though there was a good chance that Lehman would survive. A number of companies (e.g., the Korean Development Bank, Barclays Bank in the United Kingdom, and Bank of America) expressed interest in buying it, but none of these was able to close a deal. Many people thought that Lehman was “too big to fail” and that the U.S. government would have to bail it out if no purchaser could be found. This proved not to be the case.
How did this happen? It was a combination of high leverage, risky investments, and 
liquidity problems. Commercial banks that take deposits are subject to regulations on the amount of capital they must keep. Lehman was an investment bank and not subject to these regulations. By 2007, its leverage ratio had increased to 31:1, which means that a 3–4% decline in the value of its assets would wipe out its capital. Dick Fuld, Lehman’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, encouraged an aggressive deal-making, risk-taking culture. He is reported to have told his executives: “Every day is a battle. You have to kill the enemy. ” The Chief Risk Officer at Lehman was competent, but did not have much influence and was even removed from the executive committee in 2007. The risks taken by Lehman included large positions in the  
instruments created from subprime mortgages, which will be described in Chapter 8. Lehman funded much of its operations with short-term debt. When there was a loss of confidence in the company, lenders refused to renew this funding, forcing it into bankruptcy.
Lehman was very active in the over-the-counter derivatives markets. It had over a 
million transactions outstanding with about 8,000 different counterparties. Lehman’s counterparties were often required to post collateral and this collateral had in many cases been used by Lehman for various purposes. Litigation aimed at determining who owes what to whom continued for many years after the bankruptcy filing.

Market Size
Both the over-the-counter and the exchange-traded market for derivatives are huge. The 
number of derivatives transactions per year in OTC markets is smaller than in exchange-traded markets, but the average size of the transactions is much greater. Although the statistics that are collected for the two markets are not exactly comparable, it is clear that the volume of business in the over-the-counter market is much larger than in the exchange-traded market. The Bank for International Settlements (www.bis.org) started collecting statistics on the markets in 1998. Figure 1. 1 compares (a) the estimated total 
principal amounts underlying transactions that were outstanding in the over-the-counter markets between June 1998 and December 2019 and (b) the estimated total value of the assets underlying exchange-traded contracts during the same period. Using these  
measures, the size of the over-the-counter market in December 2019 was $558.5 trillion Business Snapshot 1.2 Systemic Risk
Systemic risk is the risk that a default by one financial institution will create a “ripple effect” that leads to defaults by other financial institutions and threatens the stability of the financial system. There are huge numbers of over-the-counter transactions between banks. If Bank A fails, Bank B may take a huge loss on the transactions it has with Bank A. This in turn could lead to Bank B failing. Bank C that has many outstanding transactions with both Bank A and Bank B might then take a large loss and experience severe financial difficulties; and so on.
The financial system has survived defaults such as Drexel in 1990 and Lehman 
Brothers in 2008, but regulators continue to be concerned. During the market turmoil of 2007 and 2008, many large financial institutions were bailed out, rather than being allowed to fail, because governments were concerned about systemic risk.

and the size of the exchange-traded market was $96.5 trillion.1 Figure 1. 1 shows that the 
OTC market grew rapidly up to 2007, but has seen very little net growth since then. One 
reason for the lack of growth is the popularity of compression. This is a procedure where two or more counterparties restructure transactions with each other with the result that the underlying principal is reduced.
In interpreting Figure 1. 1, we should bear in mind that the principal underlying an 
over-the-counter transaction is not the same as its value. An example of an over-the-counter transaction is an agreement to buy 100 million U.S. dollars with British pounds at a predetermined exchange rate in 1 year. The total principal amount underlying this transaction is $100 million. However, the value of the transaction might be only  
$1 million. The Bank for International Settlements estimates the gross market value of all over-the-counter transactions outstanding in December 2019 to be about  
$11.6 trillion.

1 When a CCP stands between two sides in an OTC transaction, two transactions are considered to have  
been created for the purposes of the BIS statistics.
2 A contract that is worth $1 million to one side and -+1 million to the other side would be counted as  
having a gross market value of $1 million.A relatively simple derivative is a forward contract. It is an agreement to buy or sell an asset at a certain future time for a certain price. It can be contrasted with a spot  
contract, which is an agreement to buy or sell an asset almost immediately. A forward contract is traded in the over-the-counter market—usually between two financial  
institutions or between a financial institution and one of its clients.
One of the parties to a forward contract assumes a long position and agrees to buy 
the underlying asset on a certain specified future date for a certain specified price. The other party assumes a short position and agrees to sell the asset on the same date for the same price.
Forward contracts on foreign exchange are very popular. Most large banks employ 
both spot and forward foreign-exchange traders. As we shall see in Chapter 5, there is a relationship between forward prices, spot prices, and interest rates in the two currencies. Table 1.1 provides quotes for the exchange rate between the British pound (GBP) and 
the U.S. dollar (USD) that might be made by a large international bank on May 21, 2020. The quote is for the number of USD per GBP . The first row indicates that the 1.3 FORWARD CONTRACTS

bank is prepared to buy GBP (also known as sterling) in the spot market (i.e., for  
virtually immediate delivery) at the rate of $1.2217 per GBP and sell sterling in the spot 
market at $1.2220 per GBP . The second, third, and fourth rows indicate that the bank is prepared to buy sterling in 1, 3, and 6 months at $1.2218, $1.2220, and $1.2224 per  
GBP , respectively, and to sell sterling in 1, 3, and 6 months at $1.2222, $1.2225, and $1.2230 per GBP , respectively.
Forward contracts can be used to hedge foreign currency risk. Suppose that, on  
May 21, 2020, the treasurer of a U.S. corporation knows that the corporation will pay  
£1 million in 6 months (i.e., on November 21, 2020) and wants to hedge against  
exchange rate moves. Using the quotes in Table 1. 1, the treasurer can agree to buy  
£1 million 6 months forward at an exchange rate of 1.2230. The corporation then has a long forward contract on GBP . It has agreed that on November 21, 2020, it will buy  
£1 million from the bank for $1.2230 million. The bank has a short forward contract on GBP . It has agreed that on November 21, 2020, it will sell £1 million for $1.2230 million. Both sides have made a binding commitment.
Payoffs from Forward Contracts
Consider the position of the corporation in the trade we have just described. What are the possible outcomes? The forward contract obligates the corporation to buy £1 million for $1,223,000. If the spot exchange rate rose to, say, 1.3000, at the end of the 6 months, the forward contract would be worth 
+77,000 1= +1,300,000-+1,223,0002 to the  
corporation. It would enable £1 million to be purchased at an exchange rate of  
1.2230 rather than 1.3000. Similarly, if the spot exchange rate fell to 1.2000 at the  
end of the 6 months, the forward contract would have a negative value to the  
corporation of $23,000 because it would lead to the corporation paying $23,000 more than the market price for the sterling.
In general, the payoff from a long position in a forward contract on one unit of an 
asset is
ST-K
where K is the delivery price and ST is the spot price of the asset at maturity of the 
contract. This is because the holder of the contract is obligated to buy an asset worth ST 
for K. Similarly, the payoff from a short position in a forward contract on one unit of  
an asset is
K-ST
These payoffs can be positive or negative. They are illustrated in Figure 1. 2. Because it 
costs nothing to enter into a forward contract, the payoff from the contract is also the trader’s total gain or loss from the contract.
In the example just considered, 
K=1.2230 and the corporation has a long contract. 
When ST=1.3000, the payoff is $0.077 per £1; when ST=1.2000, it is -+0.023 per £1.
Forward Prices and Spot Prices
We shall be discussing in some detail the relationship between spot and forward prices in Chapter 5. For a quick preview of why the two are related, consider a stock that pays no dividend and is worth $60. You can borrow or lend money for 1 year at 5%. What should the 1 -year forward price of the stock be?
M01_HULL0654_11_GE_C01.indd   29 30/04/2021   16:3830 CHAPTER 1
The answer is $60 grossed up at 5% for 1 year, or $63. If the forward price is more 
than this, say $67, you could borrow $60, buy one share of the stock, and sell it forward 
for $67. After paying off the loan, you would net a profit of $4 in 1 year. If the forward price is less than $63, say $58, an investor owning the stock as part of a portfolio would sell the stock for $60 and enter into a forward contract to buy it back for $58 in 1 year. The proceeds of investment would be invested at 5% to earn $3. The investor would end up $5 better off than if the stock were kept in the portfolio for the year.STKPayof f

Like a forward contract, a futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a certain time in the future for a certain price. Unlike forward contracts, futures contracts are normally traded on an exchange. To make trading possible, the exchange specifies certain standardized features of the contract. As the two parties to the contract do not necessarily know each other, the exchange clearing house stands between them as mentioned earlier.
Two large exchanges on which futures contracts are traded are the Chicago Board of 
Trade (CBOT) and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), which have now merged to form the CME Group. On these and other exchanges throughout the world, a very wide range of commodities and financial assets form the underlying assets in the various contracts. The commodities include pork bellies, live cattle, sugar, wool, lumber,  
copper, aluminum, gold, and tin. The financial assets include stock indices, currencies, and Treasury bonds. Futures prices are regularly reported in the financial press. Suppose that, on September 1, the December futures price of gold is quoted as $1,750. This is the price, exclusive of commissions, at which traders can agree to buy or sell gold for December delivery. It is determined in the same way as other prices (i.e., by the laws of supply and demand). If more traders want to go long than to go short, the price goes up; if the reverse is true, then the price goes down.1.4 FUTURES CONTRACTS

Further details on issues such as margin requirements, daily settlement procedures, 
delivery procedures, bid–ask spreads, and the role of the exchange clearing house are 
given in Chapter 2.
Options are traded both on exchanges and in the over-the-counter market. There are 
two types of option. A call option gives the holder the right to buy the underlying asset by a certain date for a certain price. A put option gives the holder the right to sell the underlying asset by a certain date for a certain price. The price in the contract is known as the exercise price or strike price; the date in the contract is known as the expiration 
date or maturity. American options can be exercised at any time up to the expiration date. 
European options can be exercised only on the expiration date itself.
3 Most of the options 
that are traded on exchanges are American. In the exchange-traded equity option  
market, one contract is usually an agreement to buy or sell 100 shares. European  
options are generally easier to analyze than American options, and some of the  
properties of an American option are frequently deduced from those of its European counterpart.
It should be emphasized that an option gives the holder the right to do something. 
The holder does not have to exercise this right. This is what distinguishes options from forwards and futures, where the holder is obligated to buy or sell the underlying asset. Whereas it costs nothing to enter into a forward or futures contract, except for margin requirements which will be discussed in Chapter 2, there is a cost to acquiring an option.
The largest exchange in the world for trading stock options is the Chicago Board 
Options Exchange (CBOE; www.cboe.com). Table 1. 2 gives the bid and ask quotes for 
some of the call options trading on Apple (ticker symbol: AAPL), on May 21, 2020. Table 1.3 does the same for put options trading on Apple on that date. The quotes are 
taken from the CBOE website. The Apple stock price at the time of the quotes was bid 316.23, ask 316.50. The bid–ask spread for an option (as a percent of the price) is usually 1.5 OPTIONS

much greater than that for the underlying stock and depends on the volume of trading. 
The option strike prices in Tables 1. 2 and 1. 3 are $290, $300, $310, $320, $330, and $340. 
The maturities are June 2020, September 2020, and December 2020. The precise  
expiration day is the third Friday of the expiration month. The June options expire on June 19, 2020, the September options on September 18, 2020, and the December options on December 18, 2020.
The tables illustrate a number of properties of options. The price of a call option 
decreases as the strike price increases, while the price of a put option increases as the strike price increases. Both types of option tend to become more valuable as their time to maturity increases. These properties of options will be discussed further in Chapter 11. 
Suppose a trader instructs a broker to buy one December call option contract on  
Apple with a strike price of $340. The broker will relay these instructions to a trader at the CBOE and the deal will be done. The (ask) price indicated in Table 1. 2 is $20.30. 
This is the price for an option to buy one share. In the United States, an option contract is a contract to buy or sell 100 shares. Therefore, the trader must arrange for $2,030 to be remitted to the exchange through the broker. The exchange will then arrange for this amount to be passed on to the party on the other side of the transaction.
In our example, the trader has obtained at a cost of $2,030 the right to buy 100 Apple 
shares for $340 each. If the price of Apple does not rise above $340 by December 18, 2020, the option is not exercised and the trader loses $2,030.
4 But if Apple does well 
and the option is exercised when the bid price for the stock is $400, the trader is able to buy 100 shares at $340 and immediately sell them for $400 for a profit of $6,000, or $3,970 when the initial cost of the option contract is taken into account.
5
An alternative trade would be to sell one September put option contract with a strike 
price of $290 at the bid price of $12.70. The trader receives 100*12.70=+1,270. If the 
Apple stock price stays above $290, the option is not exercised and the trader makes a $1,270 profit. However, if stock price falls and the option is exercised when the stock price is $250, there is a loss. The trader must buy 100 shares at $290 when they are worth only $250. This leads to a loss of $4,000, or $2,730 when the initial amount received for the option contract is taken into account.Table 1.3 Prices of put options on Apple, May 21, 2020; stock price: bid $316.23,

The stock options trading on the CBOE are American. If we assume for simplicity 
that they are European, so that they can be exercised only at maturity, the trader’s profit 
as a function of the final stock price for the two trades we have considered is shown in Figure 1. 3.
Further details about the operation of options markets and how prices such as those 
in Tables 1.2 and 1. 3 are determined by traders are given in later chapters. At this stage 
we note that there are four types of participants in options markets:
1. Buyers of calls
2. Sellers of calls
3. Buyers of puts
4. Sellers of puts.
Buyers are referred to as having long positions; sellers are referred to as having short positions. Selling an option is also known as writing the option.
Derivatives markets have been outstandingly successful. The main reason is that they 
have attracted many different types of traders and have a great deal of liquidity. When a trader wants to take one side of a contract, there is usually no problem in finding  
someone who is prepared to take the other side.
Three broad categories of traders can be identified: hedgers, speculators, and  
arbitrageurs. Hedgers use derivatives to reduce the risk that they face from potential future movements in a market variable. Speculators use them to bet on the future  
direction of a market variable. Arbitrageurs take offsetting positions in two or more instruments to lock in a profit. As described in Business Snapshot 1. 3, hedge funds have 
become big users of derivatives for all three purposes.
In the next few sections, we will consider the activities of each type of trader in more 
detail.1.6 TYPES OF TRADERS28,00026,00024,00022,00002,0004,0006,0008,00010,00012,00014,00016,000

Business Snapshot 1.3 Hedge Funds
Hedge funds have become major users of derivatives for hedging, speculation, and 
arbitrage. They are similar to mutual funds in that they invest funds on behalf of  
clients. However, they accept funds only from professional fund managers or finan-cially sophisticated individuals and do not publicly offer their securities. Mutual funds are subject to regulations requiring that the shares be redeemable at any time, that investment policies be disclosed, that the use of leverage be limited, and so on. Hedge funds are relatively free of these regulations. This gives them a great deal of freedom to develop sophisticated, unconventional, and proprietary investment strategies. The fees charged by hedge fund managers are dependent on the fund’s performance and are relatively high—typically 1 to 2% of the amount invested plus 20% of the profits. Hedge funds have grown in popularity, with about $2 trillion being invested in them throughout the world. “Funds of funds” have been set up to invest in a portfolio of hedge funds.
The investment strategy followed by a hedge fund manager often involves using 
derivatives to set up a speculative or arbitrage position. Once the strategy has been defined, the hedge fund manager must:
1. Evaluate the risks to which the fund is exposed
2. Decide which risks are acceptable and which will be hedged
3. Devise strategies (usually involving derivatives) to hedge the unacceptable risks.
Here are some examples of the labels used for hedge funds together with the trading strategies followed:
Long/Short Equities:  Purchase securities considered to be undervalued and short 
those considered to be overvalued in such a way that the exposure to the overall 
direction of the market is small.
Convertible Arbitrage:  Take a long position in a thought-to-be-undervalued convert-
ible bond combined with an actively managed short position in the underlying equity.Distressed Securities:  Buy securities issued by companies in, or close to, bankruptcy.
Emerging Markets:  Invest in debt and equity of companies in developing or emerging 
countries and in the debt of the countries themselves.Global Macro:  Carry out trades that reflect anticipated global macroeconomic trends.
Merger Arbitrage:  Trade after a possible merger or acquisition is announced so that a 
profit is made if the announced deal takes place.
In this section we illustrate how hedgers can reduce their risks with forward contracts 
and options.
Hedging Using Forward Contracts
Suppose that it is May 21, 2020, and ImportCo, a company based in the United States, knows that it will have to pay £10 million on August 21, 2020, for goods it has  1.7 HEDGERS
M01_HULL0654_11_GE_C01.indd   34 30/04/2021   16:38Introduction 35
purchased from a British supplier. The GBP/USD exchange rate quotes made by a 
financial institution are shown in Table 1. 1. ImportCo could hedge its foreign exchange 
risk by buying pounds (GBP) from the financial institution in the 3-month forward market at 1.2225. This would have the effect of fixing the price to be paid to the British exporter at $12,225,000.
Consider next another U.S. company, which we will refer to as ExportCo, that is 
exporting goods to the United Kingdom and, on May 21, 2020, knows that it will receive £30 million 3 months later. ExportCo can hedge its foreign exchange risk by selling  
£30 million in the 3-month forward market at an exchange rate of 1.2220. This would have the effect of locking in the U.S. dollars to be realized for the sterling at $36,660,000.
Note that a company might do better if it chooses not to hedge than if it chooses to 
hedge. Alternatively, it might do worse. Consider ImportCo. If the exchange rate is 1.2000 on August 21 and the company has not hedged, the £10 million that it has to pay will cost $12,000,000, which is less than $12,225,000. On the other hand, if the exchange rate is 1.3000, the £10 million will cost $13,000,000—and the company will wish that it had hedged! The position of ExportCo if it does not hedge is the reverse. If the exchange rate in August proves to be less than 1.2220, the company will wish that it had hedged; if the rate is greater than 1.2220, it will be pleased that it has not done so.
This example illustrates a key aspect of hedging. The purpose of hedging is to reduce 
risk. There is no guarantee that the outcome with hedging will be better than the  
outcome without hedging.
Hedging Using Options
Options can also be used for hedging. Consider an investor who in May of a particular year owns 1,000 shares of a particular company. The share price is $28 per share. The investor is concerned about a possible share price decline in the next 2 months and wants protection. The investor could buy ten July put option contracts on the

company’s stock with a strike price of $27.50. Each contract is on 100 shares, so this 
would give the investor the right to sell a total of 1,000 shares for a price of $27.50. If the quoted option price is $1, then each option contract would cost 
100*+1=+100 
and the total cost of the hedging strategy would be 10*+100=+1,000.
The strategy costs $1,000 but guarantees that the shares can be sold for at least $27.50 
per share during the life of the option. If the market price of the stock falls below $27.50, the options will be exercised, so that $27,500 is realized for the entire holding. When the cost of the options is taken into account, the amount realized is $26,500. If the market price stays above $27.50, the options are not exercised and expire worthless. However, in this case the value of the holding is always above $27,500 (or above $26,500 when the cost of the options is taken into account). Figure 1.4 shows the net value of the portfolio (after 
taking the cost of the options into account) as a function of the stock price in 2 months. The dotted line shows the value of the portfolio assuming no hedging.
A Comparison
There is a fundamental difference between the use of forward contracts and options  
for hedging. Forward contracts are designed to neutralize risk by fixing the price that the hedger will pay or receive for the underlying asset. Option contracts, by contrast, provide insurance. They offer a way for investors to protect themselves against adverse price movements in the future while still allowing them to benefit from favorable price movements. Unlike forwards, options involve the payment of an up-front fee.
We now move on to consider how futures and options markets can be used by specu-
lators. Whereas hedgers want to avoid exposure to adverse movements in the price of an asset, speculators wish to take a position in the market. Either they are betting that the price of the asset will go up or they are betting that it will go down.
Speculation Using Futures
Consider a U.S. speculator who in May thinks that the British pound will strengthen relative to the U.S. dollar over the next 2 months and is prepared to back that hunch to the tune of £250,000. One thing the speculator can do is purchase £250,000 in the spot market in the hope that the sterling can be sold later at a higher price. (The sterling once purchased would be kept in an interest-bearing account.) Another possibility is to take a long position in four CME July futures contracts on sterling. (Each futures contract is for the purchase of £62,500 in July.) Table 1. 4 summarizes the two alternatives on the 
assumption that the current exchange rate is 1.2220 dollars per pound and the July futures price is 1.2223 dollars per pound. If the exchange rate turns out to be 1.3000 dollars per pound in July, the futures contract alternative enables the speculator to realize a profit of 
11.3000-1.22232*250,000=+19,425. The spot market alternative 
leads to 250,000 units of an asset being purchased for $1.2220 in May and sold for $1.3000 in July, so that a profit of 
11.3000-1.22202*250,000=+19,500 is made. If 
the exchange rate falls to 1.2000 dollars per pound, the futures contract gives rise to a 
11.2223-1.20002*250,000=+5,575 loss, whereas the spot market alternative gives 1.8 SPECULATORS
M01_HULL0654_11_GE_C01.indd   36 30/04/2021   16:38Introduction 37
rise to a loss of 11.2220-1.20002*250,000=+5,500. The futures market alternative 
appears to give rise to slightly worse outcomes for both scenarios. But this is because 
the calculations do not reflect the interest that is earned or paid.
What then is the difference between the two alternatives? The first alternative of 
buying sterling requires an up-front investment of 250,000*1.2220=+305,500. In 
contrast, the second alternative requires only a small amount of cash to be deposited by the speculator in what is termed a “margin account” . (The operation of margin accounts is explained in Chapter 2.) In Table 1. 4, the initial margin requirement is 
assumed to be $5,000 per contract, or $20,000 in total. The futures market allows the speculator to obtain leverage. With a relatively small initial outlay, a large speculative position can be taken.
Speculation Using Options
Options can also be used for speculation. Suppose that it is October and a speculator considers that a stock is likely to increase in value over the next 2 months. The stock price is currently $20, and a 2-month call option with a $22.50 strike price is currently selling for $1. Table 1. 5 illustrates two possible alternatives, assuming that the specu-
lator is willing to invest $2,000. One alternative is to purchase 100 shares; the other involves the purchase of 2,000 call options (i.e., 20 call option contracts). Suppose that the speculator’s hunch is correct and the price of the stock rises to $27 by December. The first alternative of buying the stock yields a profit of
100*1+27-+202=+700
However, the second alternative is far more profitable. A call option on the stock with a strike price of $22.50 gives a payoff of $4.50, because it enables something worth $27 to Table 1.4 Speculation using spot and futures contracts. One futures contract  
is on £62,500. Initial margin on four futures contracts=+20,000.

be bought for $22.50. The total payoff from the 2,000 options that are purchased under 
the second alternative is
2,000*+4.50=+9,000
Subtracting the original cost of the options yields a net profit of
+9,000-+2,000=+7,000
The options strategy is, therefore, 10 times more profitable than directly buying the stock.
Options also give rise to a greater potential loss. Suppose the stock price falls to $15 
by December. The first alternative of buying stock yields a loss of
100*1+20-+152=+500
Because the call options expire without being exercised, the options strategy would lead to a loss of $2,000—the original amount paid for the options. Figure 1. 5 shows the profit 
or loss from the two strategies as a function of the stock price in 2 months.
Options like futures provide a form of leverage. For a given investment, the use of 
options magnifies the financial consequences. Good outcomes become very good, while bad outcomes result in the whole initial investment being lost.
A Comparison
Futures and options are similar instruments for speculators in that they both provide a way in which a type of leverage can be obtained. However, there is an important  
difference between the two. When a speculator uses futures, the potential loss as well as the potential gain is very large. When options are purchased, no matter how bad things get, the speculator’s loss is limited to the amount paid for the options.15 20 25 30

Arbitrageurs are a third important group of participants in futures, forward, and 
options markets. Arbitrage involves locking in a riskless profit by simultaneously entering into transactions in two or more markets. In later chapters we will see how arbitrage is sometimes possible when the futures price of an asset gets out of line with its spot price. We will also examine how arbitrage can be used in options markets. This section illustrates the concept of arbitrage with a very simple example.
Let us consider a stock that is traded on both the New York Stock Exchange 
(www.nyse.com) and the London Stock Exchange (www.londonstockexchange.com). Suppose that the stock price is $120 in New York and £100 in London at a time when the exchange rate is $1.2300 per pound. An arbitrageur could simultaneously buy 100 shares of the stock in New York and sell them in London to obtain a risk-free profit of
100*31+1.23*1002-+1204
or $300 in the absence of transactions costs. Transactions costs would probably  
eliminate the profit for a small trader. However, a large investment bank faces very low transactions costs in both the stock market and the foreign exchange market. It would find the arbitrage opportunity very attractive and would try to take as much advantage of it as possible.
Arbitrage opportunities such as the one just described cannot last for long. As 
arbitrageurs buy the stock in New York, the forces of supply and demand will cause the dollar price to rise. Similarly, as they sell the stock in London, the sterling price will be driven down. Very quickly the two prices will become equivalent at the current exchange rate. Indeed, the existence of profit-hungry arbitrageurs makes it unlikely that a major disparity between the sterling price and the dollar price could ever exist in the first place. Generalizing from this example, we can say that the very existence of  
arbitrageurs means that in practice only very small arbitrage opportunities are observed in the prices that are quoted in most financial markets. In this book most of the  
arguments concerning futures prices, forward prices, and the values of option contracts will be based on the assumption that no arbitrage opportunities exist.1.9 ARBITRAGEURS
Derivatives are very versatile instruments. As we have seen, they can be used for hedging, for speculation, and for arbitrage. It is this very versatility that can cause problems. Sometimes traders who have a mandate to hedge risks or follow an  
arbitrage strategy become (consciously or unconsciously) speculators. The results  
can be disastrous. One example of this is provided by the activities of JérÔ me Kerviel 
at Société Général (see Business Snapshot 1. 4).
To avoid the sort of problems Société Général encountered, it is very important for 
both financial and nonfinancial corporations to set up controls to ensure that derivatives are being used for their intended purpose. Risk limits should be set and the activities of traders should be monitored daily to ensure that these risk limits are adhered to.
Unfortunately, even when traders follow the risk limits that have been specified, big 
mistakes can happen. Some of the activities of traders in the derivatives market during 1.10 DANGERS
M01_HULL0654_11_GE_C01.indd   39 30/04/2021   16:3840 CHAPTER 1
the period leading up to the start of the financial crisis in July 2007 proved to be much 
riskier than they were thought to be by the financial institutions they worked for. As will be discussed in Chapter 8, house prices in the United States had been rising fast. Most people thought that the increases would continue—or, at worst, that house prices would simply level off. Very few were prepared for the steep decline that actually  
happened. Furthermore, very few were prepared for the high correlation between  
mortgage default rates in different parts of the country. Some risk managers did express reservations about the exposures of the companies for which they worked to the U.S. real estate market. But, when times are good (or appear to be good), there is an  
unfortunate tendency to ignore risk managers and this is what happened at many  
financial institutions during the 2006–2007 period. The key lesson from the financial crisis is that financial institutions should always be dispassionately asking “What can go wrong?” , and they should follow that up with the question “If it does go wrong, how much will we lose?”Business Snapshot 1.4 SocGen’s Big Loss in 2008
Derivatives are very versatile instruments. They can be used for hedging, speculation, and arbitrage. One of the risks faced by a company that trades derivatives is that an employee who has a mandate to hedge or to look for arbitrage opportunities may become a speculator.
JérÔme Kerviel joined Société Général (SocGen) in 2000 to work in the compliance 
area. In 2005, he was promoted and became a junior trader in the bank’s Delta One products team. He traded equity indices such as the German DAX index, the French CAC 40, and the Euro Stoxx 50. His job was to look for arbitrage opportunities.  
These might arise if a futures contract on an equity index was trading for a different price on two different exchanges. They might also arise if equity index futures prices were not consistent with the prices of the shares constituting the index. (This type of arbitrage is discussed in Chapter 5.)
Kerviel used his knowledge of the bank’s procedures to speculate while giving the 
appearance of arbitraging. He took big positions in equity indices and created  
fictitious trades to make it appear that he was hedged. In reality, he had large bets  
on the direction in which the indices would move. The size of his unhedged position grew over time to tens of billions of euros.
In January 2008, his unauthorized trading was uncovered by SocGen. Over a three-
day period, the bank unwound his position for a loss of 4.9 billion euros. This was at the time the biggest loss created by fraudulent activity in the history of finance. (Later in the year, a much bigger loss from Bernard Madoff’s Ponzi scheme came to light.)
Rogue trader losses were not unknown at banks prior to 2008. For example, in the 
1990s, Nick Leeson, who worked at Barings Bank, had a mandate similar to that of JérÔ me Kerviel. His job was to arbitrage between Nikkei 225 futures quotes in  
Singapore and Osaka. Instead he found a way to make big bets on the direction of the Nikkei 225 using futures and options, losing $1 billion and destroying the 200-year old bank in the process. In 2002, it was found that John Rusnak at Allied Irish Bank had lost $700 million from unauthorized foreign exchange trading. The lessons from these losses are that it is important to define unambiguous risk limits for traders and then to monitor what they do very carefully to make sure that the limits are adhered to.

SUMMARY
One of the exciting developments in finance over the last 40 years has been the growth 
of derivatives markets. In many situations, both hedgers and speculators find it more attractive to trade a derivative on an asset than to trade the asset itself. Some derivatives are traded on exchanges; others are traded by financial institutions, fund managers, and corporations in the over-the-counter market, or added to new issues of debt and equity securities. Much of this book is concerned with the valuation of derivatives. The aim is to present a unifying framework within which all derivatives—not just options or futures—can be valued.
In this chapter we have taken a first look at forward, futures, and option contracts. 
A forward or futures contract involves an obligation to buy or sell an asset at a certain time in the future for a certain price. There are two types of options: calls and puts. A call option gives the holder the right to buy an asset by a certain date for a certain price.  
A put option gives the holder the right to sell an asset by a certain date for a certain price. Forwards, futures, and options trade on a wide range of different underlying assets.
The success of derivatives can be attributed to their versatility. They can be used by: 
hedgers, speculators, and arbitrageurs. Hedgers are in the position where they face risk associated with the price of an asset. They use derivatives to reduce or eliminate this risk. Speculators wish to bet on future movements in the price of an asset. They use derivatives to get extra leverage. Arbitrageurs are in business to take advantage of a discrepancy between prices in two different markets. If, for example, they see the futures price of an asset getting out of line with the cash price, they will take offsetting  
positions in the two markets to lock in a profit.

The investor is comparing two alternatives to limit downside risk. The first involves  
buying one December put option contract with a strike price of $290. The second involves instructing a broker to sell the 100 shares as soon as Apple’s price reaches $290. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the two strategies.
 1.33. A bond issued by Standard Oil some time ago worked as follows
. The holder received no 
interest . At the bond’s maturity the company promised to pay $1,000 plus an additional 
amount based on the price of oil at that time . The additional amount was equal to the 
product of 170 and the excess (if any) of the price of a barrel of oil at maturity over $25 . 
The maximum additional amount paid was $2,550 (which corresponds to a price of $40  
per barrel) . Show that the bond is a combination of a regular bond, a long position in call 
options on oil with a strike price of $25, and a short position in call options on oil with a strike price of $40.

me 1.19 . If it is greater than 1.25, I will accept 1.25 . If the exchange rate is between 1.19  
and 1.25, I will sell the sterling for the exchange rate. ” How could you use options to  
satisfy the treasurer?

Futures Markets 
and Central 
Counterparties2CHAPTER  
In Chapter 1 we explained that both futures and forward contracts are agreements to  
buy or sell an asset at a future time for a certain price. A futures contract is traded on an  
exchange, and the contract terms are standardized by that exchange. A forward 
contract is traded in the over-the-counter market and can be customized to meet the needs of users.
This chapter covers the details of how futures markets work. We examine issues such 
as the specification of contracts, the operation of margin accounts, the organization of exchanges, the regulation of markets, the way in which quotes are made, and the treatment of futures transactions for accounting and tax purposes. We explain how some of the ideas pioneered by futures exchanges have been adopted by over-the-counter markets.
2.1 BACKGROUND
Examples of large futures exchanges are the CME Group (www.cmegroup.com), the Intercontinental Exchange (www.theice.com), Eurex (www.eurexchange.com), B3,  
Brazil (www.b3.com.br), the National Stock Exchange of India (www.nse-india .com), the China Financial Futures Exchange (www.cffex.com.cn), and the Tokyo Financial Exchange (www.tfx.co.jp). (See the table at the end of this book for a more complete list.)
We examine how a futures contract comes into existence by considering the corn 
futures contract traded by the CME Group. On June 5, a trader in New York might call a broker with instructions to buy 5,000 bushels of corn for delivery in September of the same year. The broker would immediately issue instructions to a trader to buy (i.e., take a long position in) one September corn contract. (Each corn contract is for the delivery  
of exactly 5,000 bushels.) At about the same time, another trader in Kansas might instruct a broker to sell 5,000 bushels of corn for September delivery. This broker  
would then issue instructions to sell (i.e., take a short position in) one corn contract. A price would be determined and the deal would be done. Under the traditional open outcry system, floor traders representing each party would physically meet to determine the price. With electronic trading, a computer matches the traders.
M02_HULL0654_11_GE_C02.indd   46 30/04/2021   16:42Futures Markets and Central Counterparties 47
The trader in New York who agreed to buy has a long futures position in one 
contract; the trader in Kansas who agreed to sell has a short futures position in one 
contract. The price agreed to is the current futures price for September corn, say 
600 cents per bushel. This price, like any other price, is determined by the laws of  
supply and demand. If, at a particular time, more traders wish to sell rather than buy September corn, the price will go down. New buyers then enter the market so that a balance between buyers and sellers is maintained. If more traders wish to buy rather than sell September corn, the price goes up. New sellers then enter the market and a balance between buyers and sellers is maintained.
Closing Out Positions
The vast majority of futures contracts do not lead to delivery. The reason is that most traders choose to close out their positions prior to the delivery period specified in the Business Snapshot 2.1 The Unanticipated Delivery of a Futures Contract
This story (which may well be apocryphal) was told to the author of this book a long time ago by a senior executive of a financial institution. It concerns a new employee of the financial institution who had not previously worked in the financial sector. One of the clients of the financial institution regularly entered into a long futures contract on live cattle for hedging purposes and issued instructions to close out the position on the last day of trading. (Live cattle futures contracts are traded by the CME Group and each contract is on 40,000 pounds of cattle.) The new employee was given responsibility for handling the account.
When the time came to close out a contract the employee noted that the client was 
long one contract and instructed a trader at the exchange to buy (not sell) one contract. The result of this mistake was that the financial institution ended up with a long position in two live cattle futures contracts. By the time the mistake was spotted trading in the contract had ceased.
The financial institution (not the client) was responsible for the mistake. As a 
result, it started to look into the details of the delivery arrangements for live  cattle 
futures contracts—something it had never done before. Under the terms of the 
 contract, cattle could be delivered by the party with the short position to a number 
of different locations in the United States during the delivery month. Because it was long, the financial institution could do nothing but wait for a party with a short position to issue a notice of intention to deliver to the exchange and for the exchange to assign that notice to the financial institution.
It eventually received a notice from the exchange and found that it would receive 
live cattle at a location 2,000 miles away the following Tuesday. The new employee was sent to the location to handle things. It turned out that the location had a cattle auction every Tuesday. The party with the short position that was making delivery bought cattle at the auction and then immediately delivered them. Unfortunately the  
cattle could not be resold until the next cattle auction the following Tuesday. The employee was therefore faced with the problem of making arrangements for the cattle  
to be housed and fed for a week. This was a great start to a first job in the financial sector!
M02_HULL0654_11_GE_C02.indd   47 30/04/2021   16:4248 CHAPTER 2
contract. Closing out a position means entering into the opposite trade to the original 
one. For example, the New York trader who bought a September corn futures contract on June 5 can close out the position by selling (i.e., shorting) one September corn futures contract on, say, July 20. The Kansas trader who sold (i.e., shorted) a September contract on June 5 can close out the position by buying one September contract on, say,  
August 25. In each case, the trader’s total gain or loss is determined by the change in  
the futures price between June 5 and the day when the contract is closed out.
Delivery is so unusual that traders sometimes forget how the delivery process works 
(see Business Snapshot 2.1). Nevertheless, we will review delivery procedures later in 
this chapter. This is because it is the possibility of final delivery that ties the futures price to the spot price.
1
1 As mentioned in Chapter 1, the spot price is the price for almost immediate delivery.
2 There are rare exceptions. As pointed out by J. E. Newsome, G. H. F. Wang, M. E. Boyd, and M. J. Fuller  
in “Contract Modifications and the Basic Behavior of Live Cattle Futures, ” Journal of Futures Markets, 24, 6 
(2004), 557–90, the CME gave the buyer some delivery options in live cattle futures starting in 1995.2.2 SPECIFICATION OF A FUTURES CONTRACT
When developing a new contract, the exchange must specify in some detail the exact 
nature of the agreement between the two parties. In particular, it must specify the asset, the contract size (exactly how much of the asset will be delivered under one contract), where delivery can be made, and when delivery can be made.
Sometimes alternatives are specified for the grade of the asset that will be delivered or  
for the delivery locations. As a general rule, it is the party with the short position (the party that has agreed to sell the asset) that chooses what will happen when alternatives are specified by the exchange.
2 When the party with the short position is ready to 
deliver, it files a notice of intention to deliver with the exchange. This notice indicates any selections it has made with respect to the grade of asset that will be delivered and the delivery location.
The Asset
When the asset is a commodity, there may be quite a variation in the quality of what is available in the marketplace. When the asset is specified, it is therefore important that the exchange stipulate the grade or grades of the commodity that are acceptable. The  
Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) has specified the asset in its orange juice futures contract as frozen concentrates that are U.S. Grade A with Brix value of not less than 62.5 degrees.
For some commodities a range of grades can be delivered, but the price received 
depends on the grade chosen. For example, in the CME Group’s corn futures contract, the standard grade is “No. 2 Yellow, ” but substitutions are allowed with the price being adjusted in a way established by the exchange. No. 1 Yellow is deliverable for 1.5 cents per bushel more than No. 2 Yellow. No. 3 Yellow is deliverable for 2 to 4 cents per bushel less than No. 2 Yellow depending on indicators of quality.
The financial assets in futures contracts are generally well defined and unambiguous. 
For example, there is no need to specify the grade of a Japanese yen. However, there are 
M02_HULL0654_11_GE_C02.indd   48 30/04/2021   16:42Futures Markets and Central Counterparties 49
some interesting features of the Treasury bond and Treasury note futures contracts  
traded on the Chicago Board of Trade. For example, the underlying asset in the 
 Treasury bond contract is any U.S. Treasury bond that has a maturity between 15 
and 25 years; in the 10-year Treasury note futures contract, the underlying asset is any Treasury note with a maturity of between 6.5 and 10 years. The exchange has a formula for adjusting the price received according to the coupon and maturity date of the bond delivered. This is discussed in Chapter 6.
The Contract Size
The contract size specifies the amount of the asset that has to be delivered under one contract. This is an important decision for the exchange. If the contract size is too large, many traders who wish to hedge relatively small exposures or who wish to take  
relatively small speculative positions will be unable to use the exchange. On the other hand, if the contract size is too small, trading may be expensive as there is a cost associated with each contract traded.
The correct size for a contract clearly depends on the likely user. Whereas the value of  
what is delivered under a futures contract on an agricultural product might be $10,000 to $20,000, it is much higher for some financial futures. For example, under the Treasury bond futures contract traded by the CME Group, instruments with a face value of $100,000 are delivered.
In some cases exchanges have introduced “mini” contracts to attract smaller traders. 
For example, the CME Group’s Mini Nasdaq 100 contract is on 20 times the Nasdaq 100 index, whereas the regular contract is on 100 times the index. (We will cover futures on indices more fully in Chapter 3.)
Delivery Arrangements
The place where delivery will be made must be specified by the exchange. This is  particularly important for commodities that involve significant transportation costs. In 
the case of the ICE frozen concentrate orange juice contract, delivery is to exchange- licensed warehouses in Florida, New Jersey, or Delaware.
When alternative delivery locations are specified, the price received by the party with 
the short position is sometimes adjusted according to the location chosen by that party. The price tends to be higher for delivery locations that are relatively far from the main sources of the commodity.
Delivery Months
A futures contract is referred to by its delivery month. The exchange must specify the  
precise period during the month when delivery can be made. For many futures  
contracts, the delivery period is the whole month.
The delivery months vary from contract to contract and are chosen by the exchange 
to meet the needs of market participants. For example, corn futures traded by the CME Group have delivery months of March, May, July, September, and December. At any given time, contracts trade for the closest delivery month and a number of subsequent delivery months. The exchange specifies when trading in a particular month’s contract will begin. The exchange also specifies the last day on which trading can take place for a 
M02_HULL0654_11_GE_C02.indd   49 30/04/2021   16:4250 CHAPTER 2
given contract. Trading generally ceases a few days before the last day on which delivery 
can be made.
Price Quotes
The exchange defines how prices will be quoted. For example, crude oil futures prices are quoted in dollars and cents. Treasury bond and Treasury note futures prices are quoted in dollars and thirty-seconds of a dollar.
Price Limits and Position Limits
For most contracts, daily price movement limits are specified by the exchange. If in a day the price moves down from the previous day’s close by an amount equal to the daily price limit, the contract is said to be limit down. If it moves up by the limit, it is said to be limit up. A limit move is a move in either direction equal to the daily price 
limit. Normally, trading ceases for the day once the contract is limit up or limit down. However, in some instances the exchange has the authority to step in and change the limits.
The purpose of daily price limits is to prevent large price movements from occurring 
because of speculative excesses. However, limits can become an artificial barrier to trading when the price of the underlying commodity is advancing or declining rapidly. Whether price limits are, on balance, good for futures markets is controversial.
Position limits are the maximum number of contracts that a speculator may hold. 
The purpose of these limits is to prevent speculators from exercising undue influence on  
the market.
2.3 CONVERGENCE OF FUTURES PRICE TO SPOT PRICE
As the delivery period for a futures contract is approached, the futures price converges to the spot price of the underlying asset. When the delivery period is reached, the  
futures price equals—or is very close to—the spot price.
To see why this is so, we first suppose that the futures price is above the spot price 
during the delivery period. Traders then have a clear arbitrage opportunity:
1. Sell (i.e., short) a futures contract
2. Buy the asset
3. Make delivery.
These steps are certain to lead to a profit equal to the amount by which the futures price exceeds the spot price. As traders exploit this arbitrage opportunity, the futures price will fall. Suppose next that the futures price is below the spot price during the delivery period. Companies interested in acquiring the asset will find it attractive to enter into a long futures contract and then wait for delivery to be made. As they do so, the futures price will tend to rise.
The result is that the futures price is very close to the spot price during the delivery 
period. Figure 2.1 illustrates the convergence of the futures price to the spot price. In Figure 2.1a the futures price is above the spot price prior to the delivery period. In

circumstances under which these two patterns are observed are discussed in Chapter 5.Figure 2.1 Relationship between futures price and spot price as the delivery period is

2.4 THE OPERATION OF MARGIN ACCOUNTS
If two traders get in touch with each other directly and agree to trade an asset in the 
future for a certain price, there are obvious risks. One of the traders may regret the deal  
and try to back out. Alternatively, the trader simply may not have the financial  
resources to honor the agreement. One of the key roles of the exchange is to organize trading so that contract defaults are avoided. This is where margin accounts come in.
Daily Settlement
To illustrate how margin accounts work, we consider a trader who buys (i.e., takes a long position in) two December gold futures contracts. We suppose that the current futures price is $1,750 per ounce. Because the contract size is 100 ounces, the trader has  
contracted to buy a total of 200 ounces at this price. The trader has to keep funds in what is known as a margin account. The amount that must be deposited at the time the  
contract is entered into is known as the initial margin. We suppose this is $6,000 per contract, or $12,000 in total. At the end of each trading day, the margin account is adjusted to reflect the trader’s gain or loss. This practice is referred to as daily settlement or marking to market.
Suppose, for example, that by the end of the first day the futures price has dropped by  
$9 from $1,750 to $1,741. The trader has a loss of 
+1,800 1= 200*+92, because the  
200 ounces of December gold, which the trader contracted to buy at $1,750, can now be sold for only $1,741. The balance in the margin account would therefore be reduced by $1,800 to $10,200. Similarly, if the price of December gold rose to $1,759 by the end of 
M02_HULL0654_11_GE_C02.indd   51 30/04/2021   16:4252 CHAPTER 2
the first day, the balance in the margin account would be increased by $1,800 to $13,800.  
A trade is first settled at the close of the day on which it takes place. It is then settled at the  
close of trading on each subsequent day.
Daily settlement leads to funds flowing each day between traders with long  positions 
and traders with short positions. If the futures price increases from one day to the next,  
funds flow from traders with short positions to traders with long positions. If the 
futures price decreases from one day to the next, funds flow in the opposite direction, from traders with short positions to traders with long positions. This daily flow of funds between traders to reflect gains and losses is known as variation margin.
Most individuals have to contact their brokers to trade. They are subject to what is 
termed a maintenance margin. This is somewhat lower than the initial margin. If the balance in the margin account falls below the maintenance margin, the trader receives a  
margin call and is expected to top up the margin account to the initial margin level within  
a short period of time. If the trader does not provide this variation margin, the broker closes out the position. In the case of the trader considered earlier, closing out the position would involve neutralizing the existing contract by selling 200 ounces of gold for  
delivery in December.
If the trader’s contract increases in value, the balance in the margin account increases. 
The trader is entitled to withdraw any balance in the margin account that is in excess of  
the initial margin.

contracts. The initial margin is $6,000 per contract, or $12,000 in total; the maintenance margin is $4,500 per contract, or $9,000 in total. The contract is entered  
into on Day 1 at $1,750 and closed out on Day 16 at $1,726.90.
M02_HULL0654_11_GE_C02.indd   52 30/04/2021   16:42Futures Markets and Central Counterparties 53
Table 2.1 illustrates the operation of the margin account for one possible sequence of  
futures prices in the case of the trader considered earlier who buys two gold futures 
contracts. The maintenance margin is assumed to be $4,500 per contract, or $9,000 in total. On Day 7 , the balance in the margin account falls $1,020 below the maintenance margin level. This drop triggers a margin call from the broker for an additional $4,020 to bring the account balance up to the initial margin level of $12,000. It is assumed that the trader provides this margin by the close of trading on Day 8. On Day 11, the balance in  
the margin account again falls below the maintenance margin level, and a margin call for $3,780 is sent out. The trader provides this margin by the close of trading on Day 12. On Day 16, the trader decides to close out the position by selling two contracts. The futures price on that day is $1,726.90, and the trader has a cumulative loss of $4,620. Note that  
the trader has excess margin on Days 8, 13, 14, and 15. It is assumed that the excess is not withdrawn.
Most brokers pay traders interest on the balance in a margin account. The balance in 
the account does not, therefore, represent a true cost, provided that the interest rate is competitive with what could be earned elsewhere. To satisfy the initial margin require-ments, but not subsequent margin calls, a trader can usually deposit securities with the broker. Treasury bills are usually accepted in lieu of cash at about 90% of their market value. Shares are also sometimes accepted in lieu of cash, but at about 50% of their market value.
Whereas a forward contract is settled at the end of its life, a futures contract is, as we 
have seen, settled daily. At the end of each day, the trader’s gain (loss) is added to  
(subtracted from) the margin account, bringing the value of the contract back to zero. A futures contract is in effect closed out and rewritten at a new price each day.
Minimum levels for the initial and maintenance margin are set by the exchange 
clearing house. Individual brokers may require greater margins from their clients than the minimum levels specified by the exchange clearing house. Minimum margin levels are determined by the variability of the price of the underlying asset and are revised when necessary. The higher the variability, the higher the margin levels. The mainten- ance margin is usually about 75% of the initial margin.
Note that margin requirements are the same on short futures positions as they are on 
long futures positions. It is just as easy to take a short futures position as it is to take a long one. The spot market does not have this symmetry. Taking a long position in the spot market involves buying the asset for immediate delivery and presents no problems. Taking a short position involves selling an asset that you do not own. This is a more  
complex transaction that may or may not be possible in a particular market. It is discussed further in Chapter 5.
The Clearing House and Its Members
A clearing house acts as an intermediary in futures transactions. It guarantees the 
 performance of the parties to each transaction. The clearing house has a number of 
members. Brokers who are not members themselves must channel their business through a member and post margin with the member. The main task of the clearing house is to keep track of all the transactions that take place during a day, so that it can calculate the net position of each of its members.
The clearing house member is required to provide to the clearing house initial margin 
(sometimes referred to as clearing margin) reflecting the total number of contracts that 
M02_HULL0654_11_GE_C02.indd   53 30/04/2021   16:4254 CHAPTER 2
are being cleared. The maintenance margin is set equal to the initial margin. At the end 
of each day, the transactions being handled by the clearing house member are settled through the clearing house. If in total the transactions have lost money, the member is required to provide variation margin to the exchange clearing house equal to the loss; if  
there has been a gain on the transactions, the member receives variation margin from the clearing house equal to the gain. Intraday variation margin payments may also be required by a clearing house from its members in times of significant price volatility; if margin requirements are not met, a member is closed out.
In determining margin requirements, the number of contracts outstanding is 
usually calculated on a net basis rather than a gross basis. This means that short positions the clearing house member is handling for clients are netted against long positions. Suppose, for example, that the clearing house member has two clients: one with a long position in 20 contracts, the other with a short position in 15 contracts. The initial margin would be calculated on the basis of five contracts. The calculation of the margin requirement is usually designed to ensure that the clearing house is about 99% certain that the margin will be sufficient to cover any losses in the event that the member defaults and has to be closed out. Clearing house members are required to contribute to a guaranty fund. This may be used by the clearing house in  
the event that a member defaults and the member’s margin proves insufficient to cover losses.
Credit Risk
The whole purpose of the margining system is to ensure that funds are available to pay traders when they make a profit. Overall the system has been very successful. Traders entering into contracts at major exchanges have always had their contracts honored. Futures markets were tested on October 19, 1987 , when the S&P 500 index declined by over 20% and traders with long positions in S&P 500 futures found they had negative margin balances with their brokers. Traders who did not meet margin calls were closed out but still owed their brokers money. Some did not pay and as a result some brokers went bankrupt because, without their clients’ money, they were unable to meet margin calls on contracts they entered into on behalf of their clients. However, the clearing houses had sufficient funds to ensure that everyone who had a short futures position on  
the S&P 500 got paid.
2.5 OTC MARKETS
Over-the-counter (OTC) markets, introduced in Chapter 1, are markets where compan-ies agree to derivatives transactions without involving an exchange. Credit risk has traditionally been a feature of OTC derivatives markets. Consider two companies, A and B, that have entered into a number of derivatives transactions. If A defaults when the net value of the outstanding transactions to B is positive, a loss is likely to be taken by B. Similarly, if B defaults when the net value of outstanding transactions to A is positive, a loss is likely to be taken by company A. In an attempt to reduce credit risk, the OTC market has borrowed some ideas from exchange-traded markets. We now discuss this.
M02_HULL0654_11_GE_C02.indd   54 30/04/2021   16:42Futures Markets and Central Counterparties 55
Central Counterparties
We briefly mentioned CCPs in Section 1.2. These are clearing houses for standard OTC 
transactions that perform much the same role as exchange clearing houses. Members of  
the CCP , similarly to members of an exchange clearing house, have to provide both initial margin and daily variation margin. Like members of an exchange clearing house, they are also required to contribute to a guaranty fund.
Once an OTC derivative transaction has been agreed between two parties A and B, it  
can be presented to a CCP . Assuming the CCP accepts the transaction, it becomes the counterparty to both A and B. (This is similar to the way the clearing house of a futures exchange becomes the counterparty to the two sides of a futures trade.) For example, if the transaction is a forward contract where A has agreed to buy an asset from B in one year for a certain price, the clearing house agrees to
1. Buy the asset from B in one year for the agreed price, and
2. Sell the asset to A in one year for the agreed price.
It takes on the credit risk of both A and B.
All members of the CCP are required to provide initial margin to the CCP. 
 Transactions are valued daily and there are daily variation margin payments to or 
from the member. If an OTC market participant is not itself a member of a CCP , it can arrange to clear its trades through a CCP member. It will then have to provide margin to the CCP member. Its relationship with the CCP member is similar to the relationship between a broker and a futures exchange clearing house member.
Following the financial crisis that started in 2007 , regulators have become more 
concerned about systemic risk (see Business Snapshot 1.2). One result of this, mentioned in Section 1.2, has been legislation requiring that most standard OTC transactions between financial institutions be handled by CCPs.
Bilateral Clearing
Those OTC transactions that are not cleared through CCPs are cleared bilaterally. In the bilaterally cleared OTC market, two companies A and B usually enter into a  master 
agreement covering all their trades.
3 This agreement usually includes an annex, referred 
to as the credit support annex or CSA, requiring A or B, or both, to provide collateral. The collateral is similar to the margin required by exchange clearing houses or CCPs from their members.
Collateral agreements in CSAs usually require transactions to be valued each day. A 
simple two-way agreement between companies A and B might work as follows. If, from one day to the next, the transactions between A and B increase in value to A by X (and therefore decrease in value to B by X), B is required to provide collateral worth X to A.  
If the reverse happens and the transactions increase in value to B by X (and decrease in  
value to A by X), A is required to provide collateral worth X to B. (To use the  
terminology of exchange-traded markets, X is the variation margin provided.) Collateral agreements and the way counterparty credit risk is assessed for bilaterally cleared transactions is discussed further in Chapter 24.
3 The most common such agreement is an International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master 
Agreement.
M02_HULL0654_11_GE_C02.indd   55 30/04/2021   16:4256 CHAPTER 2
It has historically been relatively rare for a CSA to require initial margin. This is 
changing. Starting in 2016, regulations were introduced to require both initial margin 
and variation margin for bilaterally cleared transactions between financial institutions.4 
The initial margin is posted with a third party.
Collateral significantly reduces credit risk in the bilaterally cleared OTC market (and so  
the use of CCPs for standard transactions between financial institutions and regulations requiring initial margin for other transactions between financial institutions should reduce risks for the financial system). Collateral agreements were used by hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) for its bilaterally cleared derivatives in the 1990s. The agreements allowed LTCM to be highly levered. They did provide credit protection, but as described in Business Snapshot 2.2, the high leverage left the hedge fund exposed to other risks.
Figure 2.2 illustrates the way bilateral and central clearing work. (It makes the 
 simplifying assumption that there are only eight market participants and one CCP). 
Under bilateral clearing there are many different agreements between market partici-Business Snapshot 2.2 Long-Term Capital Management’s Big Loss
Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), a hedge fund formed in the mid-1990s, always collateralized its bilaterally cleared transactions. The hedge fund’s investment strategy was known as convergence arbitrage. A very simple example of what it might  
do is the following. It would find two bonds, X and Y, issued by the same company that promised the same payoffs, with X being less liquid (i.e., less actively traded) than Y. The market places a value on liquidity. As a result the price of X would be less than the price of Y. LTCM would buy X, short Y, and wait, expecting the prices of the two bonds to converge at some future time.
When interest rates increased, the company expected both bonds to move down in  
price by about the same amount, so that the collateral it paid on bond X would be about the same as the collateral it received on bond Y. Similarly, when interest rates  
decreased, LTCM expected both bonds to move up in price by about the same amount, so that the collateral it received on bond X would be about the same as the collateral it paid on bond Y. It therefore expected that there would be no significant outflow of funds as a result of its collateralization agreements.
In August 1998, Russia defaulted on its debt and this led to what is termed a 
“flight to quality” in capital markets. One result was that investors valued liquid instruments more highly than usual and the spreads between the prices of the  liquid 
and illiquid instruments in LTCM’s portfolio increased dramatically. The prices of the bonds LTCM had bought went down and the prices of those it had shorted increased. It was required to post collateral on both. The company experienced  difficulties because it was highly leveraged. Positions had to be closed out and LTCM  
lost about $4 billion. If the company had been less highly leveraged, it would 
 probably have been able to survive the flight to quality and could have waited for 
the prices of the liquid and illiquid bonds to move back closer to each other.
4 For both this regulation and the regulation requiring standard transactions between financial institutions to  
be cleared through CCPs, “financial institutions” include banks, insurance companies, pension funds, and 
hedge funds. Transactions with most nonfinancial corporations and some foreign exchange transactions are exempt from the regulations.
M02_HULL0654_11_GE_C02.indd   56 30/04/2021   16:42Futures Markets and Central Counterparties 57
pants, as indicated in Figure 2.2a. If all OTC contracts were cleared through a single 
CCP , we would move to the situation shown in Figure 2.2b. In practice, because not all OTC transactions are routed through CCPs and there is more than one CCP , the market has elements of both Figure 2.2a and Figure 2.2b.

Futures Trades vs. OTC Trades
Regardless of how transactions are cleared, initial margin when provided in the form of  
cash usually earns interest. The daily variation margin provided by a clearing house member for futures contracts does not earn interest. This is because the variation margin constitutes the daily settlement. Transactions in the OTC market, whether cleared through CCPs or cleared bilaterally, are usually not settled daily. For this  
reason, the daily variation margin that is provided by the member of a CCP or, as a result of a CSA, earns interest when it is in the form of cash.
Securities can be often be used to satisfy margin/collateral requirements.
6 The market  
value of the securities is reduced by a certain amount to determine their value for margin purposes. This reduction is known as a haircut.Figure 2.2 (a) The traditional way in which OTC markets have operated: a series of 
bilateral agreements between market participants; (b) how OTC markets would operate with a single central counterparty (CCP) acting as a clearing house.
(a) (b)CCP
5 The impact of CCPs on credit risk depends on the number of CCPs and proportions of all trades that are  
cleared through them. See D. Duffie and H. Zhu, “Does a Central Clearing Counterparty Reduce  
Counterparty Risk?, ” Review of Asset Pricing Studies, 1 (2011): 74–95.
6 As already mentioned, the variation margin for futures contracts must be provided in the form of cash.2.6 MARKET QUOTES
Futures quotes are available from exchanges and several online sources. Table 2.2 is  
constructed from quotes provided by the CME Group for a number of different commodities on May 21, 2020. Quotes for index, currency, and interest rate futures  
are given in Chapters 3, 5, and 6, respectively.
M02_HULL0654_11_GE_C02.indd   57 30/04/2021   16:4258 CHAPTER 2
The asset underlying the futures contract, the contract size, and the way the price is  
quoted are shown at the top of each section of Table 2.2. The first asset is gold. The 
contract size is 100 ounces and the price is quoted as dollars per ounce. The maturity month of the contract is indicated in the first column of the table.
Prices
The first three numbers in each row of Table 2.2 show the opening price, the highest price in trading so far during the day, and the lowest price in trading so far during the day. The opening price is representative of the prices at which contracts were trading immediately after the start of trading on a day. For the June 2020 gold contract, the opening price on May 21, 2020 was $1,751.7 per ounce. The highest price during the day was also $1,751.7 per ounce and the lowest price during the day was $1,713.3 per ounce.
Settlement Price
The settlement price is the price used for calculating daily gains and losses and margin 
requirements. It is usually calculated as the price at which the contract traded im-mediately before the end of a day’s trading session. The fourth number in Table 2.2 shows the settlement price the previous day. The fifth number shows the most recent  
trading price, and the sixth number shows the price change from the previous day’s  settlement price. In the case of the June 2020 gold contract, the previous day’s 
 settlement price was $1,752.1. The most recent trade was at $1,725.5, $26.6 lower than  
the previous day’s settlement price. If $1,725.5 proved to be the settlement price on May  
21, 2020, the margin account of a trader with a long position in one contract would lose 
2,660 on May 21, 2020 and the margin account of a trader with a short position in one contract would gain this amount on that date.
Trading Volume and Open Interest
The final column of Table 2.2 shows the trading volume. The trading volume is the  number of contracts traded in a day. It can be contrasted with the open interest, which is 
the number of contracts outstanding, that is, the number of long positions or, equiva-
lently, the number of short positions.
If there is a large amount of trading by day traders (i.e., traders who enter into a 
position and close it out on the same day), the volume of trading in a day can be greater than either the beginning-of-day or end-of-day open interest.
Patterns of Futures
Futures prices can show a number of different patterns. They can increase with the maturity of the futures contract, decrease with the maturity of the futures contract, or  
show a mixed pattern where the futures price sometimes increases and sometimes decreases with maturity. A futures market where prices increase with maturity is known as a normal market. A futures market where futures prices decrease with maturity is known as an inverted market. Table 2.2 indicates that gold, crude oil, corn, and wheat 
exhibited a normal market on May 21, 2020 for the range of maturities considered.  
 Soyabeans and live cattle exhibit a mixture of the two patterns: normal for some 
 maturity ranges and inverted for others.

As mentioned earlier in this chapter, very few of the futures contracts that are entered 
into lead to delivery of the underlying asset. Most are closed out early. Nevertheless, it  
is the possibility of eventual delivery that determines the futures price. An under -
standing of delivery procedures is therefore important.
The period during which delivery can be made is defined by the exchange and varies  
from contract to contract. The decision on when to deliver is made by the party with the short position, whom we shall refer to as trader A. When trader A decides to  
deliver, trader A ’s broker issues a notice of intention to deliver to the exchange clearing house. This notice states how many contracts will be delivered and, in the case of  
commodities, also specifies where delivery will be made and what grade will be  
delivered. The exchange then chooses a party with a long position to accept delivery. 
Suppose that the party on the other side of trader A ’s futures contract when it was 
entered into was trader B. It is important to realize that there is no reason to expect that it will be trader B who takes delivery. Trader B may well have closed out his or  
her position by trading with trader C, trader C may have closed out his or her  
position by trading with trader D, and so on. The usual rule chosen by the exchange is to pass the notice of intention to deliver on to the party with the oldest outstanding long position. Parties with long positions must accept delivery notices. However, if the  
notices are transferable, traders with long positions usually have a short period of time to find another party with a long position that is prepared to take delivery in place of them.
In the case of a commodity, taking delivery usually means accepting a warehouse 
receipt in return for immediate payment. The party taking delivery is then responsible for all warehousing costs. In the case of livestock futures, there may be costs associated with feeding and looking after the animals (see Business Snapshot 2.1). In the case of financial futures, delivery is usually made by wire transfer. For all contracts, the price paid is usually the most recent settlement price. If specified by the exchange, this price is  
adjusted for grade, location of delivery, and so on.
There are three critical days for a contract. These are the first notice day, the last 
notice day, and the last trading day. The first notice day is the first day on which a notice of intention to make delivery can be submitted to the exchange. The last notice day is 
the last such day. The last trading day is generally a few days before the last notice day. To avoid the risk of having to take delivery, a trader with a long position should close out his or her contracts prior to the first notice day.
Cash Settlement
Some financial futures, such as those on stock indices discussed in Chapter 3, are settled in cash because it is inconvenient or impossible to deliver the underlying asset. In the case of the futures contract on the S&P 500, for example, delivering the underlying asset  
would involve delivering a portfolio of 500 stocks. When a contract is settled in cash, all outstanding contracts are declared closed on a predetermined day. The final settlement price is set equal to the spot price of the underlying asset at either the open or close of trading on that day. For example, in the S&P 500 futures contract traded by the CME  
Group, the predetermined day is the third Friday of the delivery month and final  
settlement is at the opening price on that day.2.7 DELIVERY

There are two main types of traders executing trades: futures commission merchants 
(FCMs) and locals. FCMs are following the instructions of their clients and charge a commission for doing so; locals are trading on their own account.
Individuals taking positions, whether locals or the clients of FCMs, can be categor -
ized as hedgers, speculators, or arbitrageurs, as discussed in Chapter 1. Speculators can be classified as scalpers, day traders, or position traders. Scalpers are watching for very short-term trends and attempt to profit from small changes in the contract price. They usually hold their positions for only a few minutes. Day traders hold their positions for less than one trading day. They are unwilling to take the risk that adverse news will occur overnight. Position traders hold their positions for much longer periods of time. They hope to make significant profits from major movements in the markets.
Orders
The simplest type of order placed with a broker is a market order. It is a request that a trade be carried out immediately at the best price available in the market. However, there are many other types of orders. We will consider those that are more commonly used.
A limit order specifies a particular price. The order can be executed only at this price 
or at one more favorable to the trader. Thus, if the limit price is $30 for a trader wanting to buy, the order will be executed only at a price of $30 or less. There is, of course, no guarantee that the order will be executed at all, because the limit price may never be reached.
A stop order or stop-loss order also specifies a particular price. The order is executed 
at the best available price once a bid or ask is made at that particular price or a less- favorable price. Suppose a stop order to sell at $30 is issued when the market price is $35. It becomes an order to sell when and if the price falls to $30. In effect, a stop order becomes a market order as soon as the specified price has been hit. The purpose of a stop order is usually to close out a position if unfavorable price movements take place. It limits the loss that can be incurred.
A stop–limit order is a combination of a stop order and a limit order. The order 
becomes a limit order as soon as a bid or ask is made at a price equal to or less favorable than the stop price. Two prices must be specified in a stop–limit order: the stop price and  
the limit price. Suppose that at the time the market price is $35, a stop–limit order to buy is issued with a stop price of $40 and a limit price of $41. As soon as there is a bid or  
ask at $40, the stop–limit becomes a limit order at $41. If the stop price and the limit price are the same, the order is sometimes called a stop-and-limit order.
A market-if-touched (MIT) order is executed at the best available price after a trade 
occurs at a specified price or at a price more favorable than the specified price. In effect, an MIT becomes a market order once the specified price has been hit. An MIT is also known as a board order. Consider a trader who has a long position in a futures contract and is issuing instructions that would lead to closing out the contract. A stop order is designed to place a limit on the loss that can occur in the event of unfavorable price movements. By contrast, a market-if-touched order is designed to ensure that profits are  
taken if sufficiently favorable price movements occur.
A discretionary order or market-not-held order is traded as a market order except that 
execution may be delayed at the broker’s discretion in an attempt to get a better price.2.8 TYPES OF TRADERS AND TYPES OF ORDERS
M02_HULL0654_11_GE_C02.indd   61 30/04/2021   16:4262 CHAPTER 2
Some orders specify time conditions. Unless otherwise stated, an order is a day order 
and expires at the end of the trading day. A time-of-day order specifies a particular 
period of time during the day when the order can be executed. An open order or a good- till-canceled order is in effect until executed or until the end of trading in the particular contract. A fill-or-kill order, as its name implies, must be executed immediately on 
receipt or not at all.
2.9 REGULATION
Futures markets in the United States are currently regulated federally by the Commod-ity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC; www.cftc.gov), which was established  
in 1974.
The CFTC looks after the public interest. It is responsible for ensuring that prices are 
communicated to the public and that futures traders report their outstanding positions if they are above certain levels. The CFTC also licenses all individuals who offer their services to the public in futures trading. The backgrounds of these individuals are  
investigated, and there are minimum capital requirements. The CFTC deals with complaints brought by the public and ensures that disciplinary action is taken against individuals when appropriate. It has the authority to force exchanges to take disciplin-ary action against members who are in violation of exchange rules.
With the formation of the National Futures Association (NFA; www.nfa.futures.
org) in 1982, some of responsibilities of the CFTC were shifted to the futures industry  
itself. The NFA is an organization of individuals who participate in the futures  
industry. Its objective is to prevent fraud and to ensure that the market operates in  
the best interests of the general public. It is authorized to monitor trading and take disciplinary action when appropriate. The agency has set up an efficient system for arbitrating disputes between individuals and its members.
The Dodd–Frank act, signed into law by President Obama in 2010, expanded the role  
of the CFTC. For example, it is now responsible for rules requiring that standard over-the-counter derivatives between financial institutions be traded on swap execution facilities and cleared through central counterparties (see Section 1.2).
Trading Irregularities
Most of the time futures markets operate efficiently and in the public interest. However,  
from time to time, trading irregularities do come to light. One type of trading irregularity occurs when a trader group tries to “corner the market. ”
7 The trader group  
takes a huge long futures position and also tries to exercise some control over the supply of the underlying commodity. As the maturity of the futures contracts is approached, the trader group does not close out its position, so that the number of outstanding futures contracts may exceed the amount of the commodity available for delivery. The holders of short positions realize that they will find it difficult to deliver and become desperate to close out their positions. The result is a large rise in both futures and spot prices. Regulators usually deal with this type of abuse of the market by  
7 Possibly the best known example of this was the attempt by the Hunt brothers to corner the silver market in  
1979–80. Between the middle of 1979 and the beginning of 1980, their activities led to a price rise from $6 per  
ounce to $50 per ounce.

The full details of the accounting and tax treatment of futures contracts are beyond the  
scope of this book. A trader who wants detailed information on this should obtain  
professional advice. This section provides some general background information.
Accounting
Accounting standards require changes in the market value of a futures contract to be 
recognized when they occur unless the contract qualifies as a hedge. If the contract does qualify as a hedge, gains or losses are generally recognized for accounting purposes in the same period in which the gains or losses from the item being hedged are recognized. The latter treatment is referred to as hedge accounting.
Consider a company with a December year end. In September 2020 it buys a March 
2021 corn futures contract and closes out the position at the end of February 2021.  Suppose that the futures prices are 350 cents per bushel when the contract is entered 
into, 370 cents per bushel at the end of 2020, and 380 cents per bushel when the  contract is closed out. The contract is for the delivery of 5,000 bushels. If the contract 
does not qualify as a hedge, the gains for accounting purposes are
5,000*13.70-3.502=+1,000
in 2020 and
5,000*13.80-3.702=+500
in 2021. If the company is hedging the purchase of 5,000 bushels of corn in February 2021 so that the contract qualifies for hedge accounting, the entire gain of $1,500 is realized in 2021 for accounting purposes.
The treatment of hedging gains and losses is sensible. If the company is hedging the 
purchase of 5,000 bushels of corn in February 2021, the effect of the futures contract is to ensure that the price paid (inclusive of the futures gain or loss) is close to 350 cents per bushel. The accounting treatment reflects that this price is paid in 2021.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued FAS 133 and ASC 815 
explaining when companies can and cannot use hedge accounting. The International Accounting Standards Board has similarly issued IAS 39 and IFRS 9.
Tax
Under the U.S. tax rules, two key issues are the nature of a taxable gain or loss and the timing of the recognition of the gain or loss. Gains or losses are either classified as  capital gains or losses or alternatively as part of ordinary income.
For a corporate taxpayer, capital gains are taxed at the same rate as ordinary income, 
and the ability to deduct losses is restricted. Capital losses are deductible only to the 
extent of capital gains. A corporation may carry back a capital loss for three years and carry it forward for up to five years. For a noncorporate taxpayer, short-term capital increasing margin requirements or imposing stricter position limits or prohibiting trades  
that increase a speculator’s open position or requiring market participants to close out  
their positions.
2.10 ACCOUNTING AND TAX
M02_HULL0654_11_GE_C02.indd   63 30/04/2021   16:4264 CHAPTER 2
gains are taxed at the same rate as ordinary income, but long-term capital gains are 
subject to a maximum capital gains tax rate of 20%. (Long-term capital gains are gains from the sale of a capital asset held for longer than one year; short-term capital gains are the gains from the sale of a capital asset held one year or less.) Taxpayers earning income above certain thresholds pay an additional 3.8% on all investment income. For a noncorporate taxpayer, capital losses are deductible to the extent of capital gains plus ordinary income up to $3,000 and can be carried forward indefinitely.
Generally, positions in futures contracts are treated as if they are closed out on the 
last day of the tax year. For the noncorporate taxpayer, this gives rise to capital gains and losses that are treated as if they were 60% long term and 40% short term without regard to the holding period. This is referred to as the “
60>40” rule. A noncorporate 
taxpayer may elect to carry back for three years any net losses from the 60>40 rule to 
offset any gains recognized under the rule in the previous three years.
Hedging transactions are exempt from this rule. The definition of a hedge  transaction 
for tax purposes is different from that for accounting purposes. The tax regulations define a hedging transaction as a transaction entered into in the normal course of  business primarily for one of the following reasons:
1. To reduce the risk of price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to 
 property that is held or to be held by the taxpayer for the purposes of producing 
ordinary income
2. To reduce the risk of price or interest rate changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made by the taxpayer.
A hedging transaction must be clearly identified in a timely manner in the company’s records as a hedge. Gains or losses from hedging transactions are treated as ordinary income. The timing of the recognition of gains or losses from hedging transactions  generally matches the timing of the recognition of income or expense associated with 
the transaction being hedged.
2.11 FORWARD vs. FUTURES CONTRACTS
The main differences between forward and futures contracts are summarized in Table 2.3. Both contracts are agreements to buy or sell an asset for a certain price at a certain future  
time. A forward contract is traded in the over-the-counter market and there is no  
standard contract size or standard delivery arrangements. A single delivery date is usually  
specified and the contract is usually held to the end of its life and then settled. A futures contract is a standardized contract traded on an exchange. A range of delivery dates is usually specified. It is settled daily and usually closed out prior to maturity.
Profits from Forward and Futures Contracts
Suppose that the sterling exchange rate for a 90-day forward contract is 1.2000 and that this rate is also the futures price for a contract that will be delivered in exactly 90 days. What is the difference between the gains and losses under the two contracts?
Under the forward contract, the whole gain or loss is realized at the end of the life  
of the contract. Under the futures contract, the gain or loss is realized day by day because of the daily settlement procedures. Suppose that trader A is long £1 million in  
M02_HULL0654_11_GE_C02.indd   64 30/04/2021   16:42Futures Markets and Central Counterparties 65
Forward Futures
Private contract between two parties Traded on an exchange
Not standardized Standardized contract
Usually one specified delivery date Range of delivery dates
Settled at end of contract Settled daily
Delivery or final cash settlement  
usually takes placeContract is usually closed out  prior to maturity
Some credit risk Virtually no credit riskTable 2.3  Comparison of forward and futures contracts.
a 90-day forward contract and trader B is long £1 million in 90-day futures contracts. (Because each futures contract is for the purchase or sale of £62,500, trader B must purchase a total of 16 contracts.) Assume that the spot exchange rate in 90 days  
proves to be 1.4000 dollars per pound. Trader A makes a gain of $200,000 on the 90th  
day. Trader B makes the same gain—but spread out over the 90-day period. On some days trader B may realize a loss, whereas on other days he or she makes a gain.  
However, in total, when losses are netted against gains, there is a gain of $200,000 over the 90-day period.
Foreign Exchange Quotes
Both forward and futures contracts trade actively on foreign currencies. However,  
there is sometimes a difference in the way exchange rates are quoted in the two  
markets. For example, futures prices where one currency is the U.S. dollar are always quoted as the number of U.S. dollars per unit of the foreign currency or as the  
number of U.S. cents per unit of the foreign currency. Forward prices are always  
quoted in the same way as spot prices. This means that, for the British pound, the  
euro, the Australian dollar, and the New Zealand dollar, the forward quotes show the number of U.S. dollars per unit of the foreign currency and are directly comparable  
with futures quotes. For other major currencies, forward quotes show the number of units of the foreign currency per U.S. dollar (USD). Consider the Canadian dollar (CAD). A futures price quote of 0.7500 USD per CAD corresponds to a forward price quote of 1.3333 CAD per USD 
11.3333=1>0.75002.
SUMMARY
A very high proportion of the futures contracts that are traded do not lead to the  
delivery of the underlying asset. Traders usually enter into offsetting contracts to close out their positions before the delivery period is reached. However, it is the possibility of  
final delivery that drives the determination of the futures price. For each futures  
contract, there is a range of days during which delivery can be made and a well-defined delivery procedure. Some contracts, such as those on stock indices, are settled in cash rather than by delivery of the underlying asset.
M02_HULL0654_11_GE_C02.indd   65 30/04/2021   16:4266 CHAPTER 2
The specification of contracts is an important activity for a futures exchange. The two  
sides to any contract must know what can be delivered, where delivery can take place, 
and when delivery can take place. They also need to know details on the trading hours, how prices will be quoted, maximum daily price movements, and so on. New contracts  
must be approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission before trading  
starts.
Margin accounts are an important aspect of futures markets. A trader keeps a margin 
account with his or her broker. The account is adjusted daily to reflect gains or losses, and from time to time the broker may require the account to be topped up if adverse price movements have taken place. The broker either must be a clearing house member or must maintain a margin account with a clearing house member. Each clearing house member maintains a margin account with the exchange clearing house. The balance in the account is adjusted daily to reflect gains and losses on the business for which the clearing house member is responsible.
In over-the-counter derivatives markets, transactions are cleared either bilaterally or  
centrally. When bilateral clearing is used, collateral frequently has to be posted by one or both parties to reduce credit risk. When central clearing is used, a central counter-  
party (CCP) stands between the two sides. It requires each side to provide margin and performs much the same function as an exchange clearing house.
Forward contracts differ from futures contracts in a number of ways. Forward  
contracts are private arrangements between two parties, whereas futures contracts are traded on exchanges. There is generally a single delivery date in a forward contract, whereas futures contracts frequently involve a range of such dates. Because they are not  
traded on exchanges, forward contracts do not need to be standardized. A forward  
contract is not usually settled until the end of its life, and most contracts do in fact lead to delivery of the underlying asset or a cash settlement at this time.
In the next few chapters we shall examine in more detail the ways in which forward 
and futures contracts can be used for hedging. We shall also look at how forward and futures prices are determined.

 2.16.  What do you think would happen if an exchange started trading a contract in which the 
quality of the underlying asset was incompletely specified?
 2.17. “When a futures contract is traded on the floor of the exchange, it may be the case that

 2.18. Suppose that, on October 24, 2022, a company sells one April 2023 live cattle futures 
contract. It closes out its position on January 21, 2023. The futures price (per pound) is 121.20 cents when it enters into the contract, 118.30 cents when it closes out its position, and 118.80 cents at the end of December 2022. One contract is for the delivery of 40,000 pounds of cattle. What is the total profit? How is it taxed if the company is (a) a hedger and (b) a speculator?

 2.20. It is July 2021. A mining company has just discovered a small deposit of gold. It will 
take 6 months to construct the mine. The gold will then be extracted on a more or less  
continuous basis for 1 year. Futures contracts on gold are available with delivery

CCPs to be used for all standardized derivatives transactions between financial 
 institutions?
 2.22. Trader A enters into futures contracts to buy 1 million euros for 1.1 million dollars in 
three months. Trader B enters in a forward contract to do the same thing.

Ignoring daily settlement, what is the total profit of each trader? When the impact of daily settlement is taken into account, which trader has done better?
 2.23. Explain what is meant by open interest. Why does the open interest usually decline during 
the month preceding the delivery month? On a particular day, there were 2,000 trades in a  
particular futures contract. This means that there were 2,000 buyers (going long) and 2,000 sellers (going short). Of the 2,000 buyers, 1,400 were closing out positions and 600 were entering into new positions. Of the 2,000 sellers, 1,200 were closing out positions and 800 were entering into new positions.

Many of the participants in futures markets are hedgers. Their aim is to use futures 
markets to reduce a particular risk that they face. This risk might relate to fluctuations in the price of oil, a foreign exchange rate, the level of the stock market, or some other variable. A perfect hedge is one that completely eliminates the risk. Perfect hedges are rare. For the most part, therefore, a study of hedging using futures contracts is a study of the ways in which hedges can be constructed so that they perform as close to perfectly as possible.
In this chapter we consider a number of general issues associated with the way hedges 
are set up. When is a short futures position appropriate? When is a long futures  
position appropriate? Which futures contract should be used? What is the optimal size of the futures position for reducing risk? At this stage, we restrict our attention to what might be termed hedge-and-forget strategies. We assume that no attempt is made to adjust the hedge once it has been put in place. The hedger simply takes a futures  
position at the beginning of the life of the hedge and closes out the position at the end of the life of the hedge. In Chapter 19 we will examine dynamic hedging strategies in which the hedge is monitored closely and frequent adjustments are made.
The chapter initially treats futures contracts as forward contracts (that is, it ignores 
daily settlement). Later it explains adjustments that are necessary to take account of the difference between futures and forwards.Hedging Strategies 
Using Futures3 CHAPTER  
When an individual or company chooses to use futures markets to hedge a risk, the objective is often to take a position that neutralizes the risk as far as possible.  
Consider a company that knows it will gain $10,000 for each 1 cent increase in the price of a commodity over the next 3 months and lose $10,000 for each 1 cent decrease in the price during the same period. To hedge, the company’s treasurer should take a short futures position that is designed to offset this risk. The futures position should lead to a loss of $10,000 for each 1 cent increase in the price of the commodity over the 3 months and a gain of $10,000 for each 1 cent decrease in the price during this period. If the price of the commodity goes down, the gain on the futures position offsets the loss on the rest of the company’s business. If the price of the commodity 3.1 BASIC PRINCIPLES
M03_HULL0654_11_GE_C03.indd   70 30/04/2021   16:44Hedging Strategies Using Futures 71
goes up, the loss on the futures position is offset by the gain on the rest of the  
company’s business.
Short Hedges
A short hedge is a hedge, such as the one just described, that involves a short position in 
futures contracts. A short hedge is appropriate when the hedger already owns an asset 
and expects to sell it at some time in the future. For example, a short hedge could be used by a farmer who owns some hogs and knows that they will be ready for sale at the local market in two months. A short hedge can also be used when an asset is not owned right now but will be owned and ready for sale at some time in the future. Consider, for example, a U.S. exporter who knows that he or she will receive euros in 3 months. The exporter will realize a gain if the euro increases in value relative to the U.S. dollar and will sustain a loss if the euro decreases in value relative to the U.S. dollar. A short  
futures position leads to a loss if the euro increases in value and a gain if it decreases in value. It has the effect of offsetting the exporter’s risk.
To provide a more detailed illustration of the operation of a short hedge in a specific 
situation, we assume that it is May 15 today and that an oil producer has just negotiated a contract to sell 1 million barrels of crude oil. It has been agreed that the price that will apply in the contract is the market price on August 15. The oil producer is therefore in the position where it will gain $10,000 for each 1 cent increase in the price of oil over the next 3 months and lose $10,000 for each 1 cent decrease in the price during this period. Suppose that on May 15 the spot price is $50 per barrel and the crude oil futures price for August delivery is $49 per barrel. Because each futures contract is for the delivery of 1,000 barrels, the company can hedge its exposure by shorting (i.e., selling) 1,000  
futures contracts. If the oil producer closes out its position on August 15, the effect  
of the strategy should be to lock in a price close to $49 per barrel.
To illustrate what might happen, suppose that the spot price on August 15 proves to 
be $45 per barrel. The company realizes $45 million for the oil under its sales contract. Because August is the delivery month for the futures contract, the futures price on August 15 should be very close to the spot price of $45 on that date. The company therefore gains approximately
+49-+45=+4
per barrel, or $4 million in total from the short futures position. The total amount  
realized from both the futures position and the sales contract is therefore approximately $49 per barrel, or $49 million in total.
For an alternative outcome, suppose that the price of oil on August 15 proves to be 
$55 per barrel. The company realizes $55 per barrel for the oil and loses approximately
+55-+49=+6
per barrel on the short futures position. Again, the total amount realized is approxi-mately $49 million. It is easy to see that in all cases the company ends up with  
approximately $49 million.
Long Hedges
Hedges that involve taking a long position in a futures contract are known as long 
hedges. A long hedge is appropriate when a company knows it will have to purchase a certain asset in the future and wants to lock in a price now.
M03_HULL0654_11_GE_C03.indd   71 30/04/2021   16:4472 CHAPTER 3
Suppose that it is now January 15. A copper fabricator knows it will require 100,000 
pounds of copper on May 15 to meet a certain contract. The spot price of copper is  
340 cents per pound, and the futures price for May delivery is 320 cents per pound. The 
fabricator can hedge its position by taking a long position in four futures contracts offered by the CME Group and closing its position on May 15. Each contract is for the delivery of 25,000 pounds of copper. The strategy has the effect of locking in the price of the required copper at close to 320 cents per pound.
Suppose that the spot price of copper on May 15 proves to be 325 cents per pound. 
Because May is the delivery month for the futures contract, this should be very close to the futures price. The fabricator therefore gains approximately
100,000*1+3.25-+3.202=+5,000
on the futures contracts. It pays 100,000*+3.25=+325,000 for the copper, making the 
net cost approximately +325,000-+5,000=+320,000. For an alternative outcome, 
suppose that the spot price is 305 cents per pound on May 15. The fabricator then  
loses approximately
100,000*1+3.20-+3.052=+15,000
on the futures contract and pays 100,000*+3.05=+305,000 for the copper. Again, the 
net cost is approximately $320,000, or 320 cents per pound.
Note that, in this case, it is clearly better for the company to use futures contracts 
than to buy the copper on January 15 in the spot market. If it does the latter, it will pay 340 cents per pound instead of 320 cents per pound and will incur both interest costs and storage costs. For a company using copper on a regular basis, this disadvantage would be offset by the convenience of having the copper on hand.
1 However, for a 
company that knows it will not require the copper until May 15, the futures contract alternative is likely to be preferred.
The examples we have looked at assume that the futures position is closed out in the 
delivery month. The hedge has the same basic effect if delivery is allowed to happen. However, making or taking delivery can be costly and inconvenient. For this reason, delivery is not usually made even when the hedger keeps the futures contract until the delivery month. As will be discussed later, hedgers with long positions usually avoid  
any possibility of having to take delivery by closing out their positions before the  
delivery period.
We have also assumed in the two examples that there is no daily settlement. In  
practice, daily settlement does have a small effect on the performance of a hedge. As explained in Chapter 2, it means that the payoff from the futures contract is realized day by day throughout the life of the hedge rather than all at the end.
1 See Section 5.11 for a discussion of convenience yields.The arguments in favor of hedging are so obvious that they hardly need to be stated. Most nonfinancial companies are in the business of manufacturing, or retailing or wholesaling, or providing a service. They have no particular skills or expertise in  
predicting variables such as interest rates, exchange rates, and commodity prices.  3.2 ARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST HEDGING
M03_HULL0654_11_GE_C03.indd   72 30/04/2021   16:44Hedging Strategies Using Futures 73
(Indeed, even experts are often wrong when they make predictions about these vari-
ables.) It makes sense for them to hedge the risks associated with these variables as they become aware of them. The companies can then focus on their main activities. By  
hedging, they avoid unpleasant surprises such as sharp rises in the price of a commo dity 
that is being purchased.
In practice, many risks are left unhedged. In the rest of this section we will explore 
some of the reasons for this.
Hedging and Shareholders
One argument sometimes put forward is that the shareholders can, if they wish, do the hedging themselves. They do not need the company to do it for them. This argument is, however, open to question. It assumes that shareholders have as much information as the company’s management about the risks faced by a company. In most instances, this is not the case. The argument also ignores commissions and other transactions costs. These are less expensive per dollar of hedging for large transactions than for small transactions. Hedging is therefore likely to be less expensive when carried out by the company than when it is carried out by individual shareholders.
One thing that shareholders can do far more easily than a corporation is diversify 
risk. A shareholder with a well-diversified portfolio may be immune to many of the  
risks faced by a corporation. For example, in addition to holding shares in a company that uses copper, a well-diversified shareholder may hold shares in a copper producer, so that there is very little overall exposure to the price of copper. If companies are acting in the best interests of well-diversified shareholders, it can be argued that hedging is unnecessary in many situations. However, the extent to which managers are in practice influenced by this type of argument is open to question.
Hedging and Competitors
If hedging is not the norm in a certain industry, it may not make sense for one  
particular company to choose to be different from all others. Competitive pressures within the industry may be such that the prices of the goods and services produced by the industry fluctuate to reflect raw material costs, interest rates, exchange rates, and so on. A company that does not hedge can expect its profit margins to be roughly  
constant. However, a company that does hedge can expect its profit margins to  
fluctuate!
To illustrate this point, consider two manufacturers of gold jewelry, SafeandSure 
Company and TakeaChance Company. We assume that most companies in the industry do not hedge against movements in the price of gold and that TakeaChance Company is no exception. However, SafeandSure Company has decided to be different from its competitors and to use futures contracts to hedge its purchase of gold over the next  
18 months. If the price of gold goes up, economic pressures will tend to lead to a  
corresponding increase in the wholesale price of jewelry, so that TakeaChance Company’s gross profit margin is unaffected. By contrast, SafeandSure Company’s profit margin will increase after the effects of the hedge have been taken into account. If the price of gold goes down, economic pressures will tend to lead to a corresponding decrease in the wholesale price of jewelry. Again, TakeaChance Company’s profit margin is unaffected. However, SafeandSure Company’s profit margin goes down. In extreme conditions, 
M03_HULL0654_11_GE_C03.indd   73 30/04/2021   16:4474 CHAPTER 3
SafeandSure Company’s profit margin could become negative as a result of the “hedging” 
carried out! The situation is summarized in Table 3.1.
This example emphasizes the importance of looking at the big picture when hedging. 
All the implications of price changes on a company’s profitability should be taken into account in the design of a hedging strategy to protect against the price changes.
Hedging Can Lead to a Worse Outcome
It is important to realize that a hedge using futures contracts can result in a decrease or an increase in a company’s profits relative to the position it would be in with no  
hedging. In the example involving the oil producer considered earlier, if the price of oil goes down, the company loses money on its sale of 1 million barrels of oil, and the futures position leads to an offsetting gain. The treasurer can be congratulated for  
having had the foresight to put the hedge in place. Clearly, the company is better off  than it would be with no hedging. Other executives in the organization, it is hoped, will appreciate the contribution made by the treasurer. If the price of oil goes up, the  
company gains from its sale of the oil, and the futures position leads to an offsetting  
loss. The company is in a worse position than it would be with no hedging. Although  
the hedging decision was perfectly logical, the treasurer may in practice have a difficult time justifying it. Suppose that the price of oil at the end of the hedge is $59, so that the company loses $10 per barrel on the futures contract. We can imagine a conversation such as the following between the treasurer and the president:
President:  This is terrible. We’ve lost $10 million in the futures market in the space of three months. How could it happen? I want a full explanation.
Treasurer:  The purpose of the futures contracts was to hedge our exposure to the price of oil, not to make a profit. Don’t forget we made $10 million from the favorable effect of the oil price increases on our business.
President:  What’s that got to do with it? That’s like saying that we do not need to worry when our sales are down in California because they are up in New York.
Treasurer:  If the price of oil had gone down . . . 
President:  I don’t care what would have happened if the price of oil had gone down. The fact is that it went up. I really do not know what you were doing playing the futures markets like this. Our shareholders will expect us to have done particularly well this quarter. I’m going to have to explain to them that your actions reduced profits by $10 million. I’m afraid this is going to mean no bonus for you this year.Table 3.1 Danger in hedging when competitors do not hedge.

President:  Unfair! You are lucky not to be fired. You lost $10 million.

It is easy to see why many treasurers are reluctant to hedge! Hedging reduces risk for 
the company. However, it may increase risk for the treasurer if others do not fully under -
stand what is being done. The only real solution to this problem involves ensuring that all senior executives within the organization fully understand the nature of hedging before a hedging program is put in place. Ideally, hedging strategies are set by a  
company’s board of directors and are clearly communicated to both the company’s management and the shareholders. (See Business Snapshot 3.1 for a discussion of hedging by gold mining companies.)Business Snapshot 3.1 Hedging by Gold Mining Companies
It is natural for a gold mining company to consider hedging against changes in the price of gold. Typically it takes several years to extract all the gold from a mine. Once a gold mining company decides to go ahead with production at a particular mine, it has a big exposure to the price of gold. Indeed a mine that looks profitable at the outset could become unprofitable if the price of gold plunges.
Gold mining companies are careful to explain their hedging strategies to potential 
shareholders. Some gold mining companies do not hedge. They tend to attract shareholders who buy gold stocks because they want to benefit when the price of gold increases and are prepared to accept the risk of a loss from a decrease in the price of gold. Other companies choose to hedge. They estimate the number of ounces of gold they will produce each month for the next few years and enter into short futures or forward contracts to lock in the price for all or part of this.
Suppose you are Goldman Sachs and are approached by a gold mining company 
that wants to sell you a large amount of gold in 1 year at a fixed price. How do you set the price and then hedge your risk? The answer is that you can hedge by  
borrowing the gold from a central bank, selling it immediately in the spot market, and investing the proceeds at the risk-free rate. At the end of the year, you buy the gold from the gold mining company and use it to repay the central bank. The fixed forward price you set for the gold reflects the risk-free rate you can earn and the lease rate you pay the central bank for borrowing the gold.
The hedges in the examples considered so far have been almost too good to be true. The hedger was able to identify the precise date in the future when an asset would be bought or sold. The hedger was then able to use futures contracts to remove almost all the risk arising from the price of the asset on that date. In practice, hedging is often not quite as straightforward as this. Some of the reasons are as follows:
1. The asset whose price is to be hedged may not be exactly the same as the asset underlying the futures contract.3.3 BASIS RISK
M03_HULL0654_11_GE_C03.indd   75 30/04/2021   16:4476 CHAPTER 3
2. There may be uncertainty as to the exact date when the asset will be bought or sold.
3. The hedge may require the futures contract to be closed out before its delivery 
month.
These problems give rise to what is termed basis risk. This concept will now be explained.
The Basis
The basis in a hedging situation is as follows:2
Basis=Spot price of asset to be hedged-Futures price of contract used
If the asset to be hedged and the asset underlying the futures contract are the same, the basis should be zero at the expiration of the futures contract. Prior to expiration, the basis may be positive or negative.
As time passes, the spot price and the futures price for a particular month do not 
necessarily change by the same amount. As a result, the basis changes. An increase in the basis is referred to as a strengthening of the basis; a decrease in the basis is referred to as a weakening of the basis. Figure 3.1 illustrates how a basis might change over time in a situation where the basis is positive prior to expiration of the futures contract.
To examine the nature of basis risk, we will use the following notation:
S1: Spot price at time t1
S2: Spot price at time t2
F1: Futures price at time t1
F2: Futures price at time t2
b1: Basis at time t1
b2: Basis at time t2.
We will assume that a hedge is put in place at time t1 and closed out at time t2. As an 
example, we will consider the case where the spot and futures prices at the time the 
2 This is the usual definition. However, the alternative definition Basis=Futures price-Spot price is  
sometimes used, particularly when the futures contract is on a financial asset.Time

M03_HULL0654_11_GE_C03.indd   76 30/04/2021   16:44Hedging Strategies Using Futures 77
hedge is initiated are $2.50 and $2.20, respectively, and that at the time the hedge is 
closed out they are $2.00 and $1.90, respectively. This means that S1=2.50, F1=2.20, 
S2=2.00, and F2=1.90.
From the definition of the basis, we have
b1=S1-F1 and b2=S2-F2
so that, in our example, b1=0.30 and b2=0.10.
Consider first the situation of a hedger who knows that the asset will be sold at time t2 
and takes a short futures position at time t1. The price realized for the asset is S2 and the 
profit on the futures position is F1-F2. The effective price that is obtained for the asset 
with hedging is therefore
S2+F1-F2=F1+b2
In our example, this is $2.30. The value of F1 is known at time t1. If b2 were also known 
at this time, a perfect hedge would result. The hedging risk is the uncertainty associated with 
b2 and is known as basis risk. Consider next a situation where a company knows it 
will buy the asset at time t2 and initiates a long hedge at time t1. The price paid for the 
asset is S2 and the loss on the hedge is F1-F2. The effective price that is paid with 
hedging is therefore
S2+F1-F2=F1+b2
This is the same expression as before and is $2.30 in the example. The value of F1 is 
known at time t1, and the term b2 represents basis risk.
Note that basis changes can lead to an improvement or a worsening of a hedger’s 
position. Consider a company that uses a short hedge because it plans to sell the  
underlying asset. If the basis strengthens (i.e., increases) unexpectedly, the company’s position improves because it will get a higher price for the asset after futures gains or losses are considered; if the basis weakens (i.e., decreases) unexpectedly, the company’s position worsens. For a company using a long hedge because it plans to buy the asset, the reverse holds. If the basis strengthens unexpectedly, the company’s position worsens because it will pay a higher price for the asset after futures gains or losses are  
considered; if the basis weakens unexpectedly, the company’s position improves.
The asset that gives rise to the hedger’s exposure is sometimes different from the 
asset underlying the futures contract that is used for hedging. This is known as cross hedging and is discussed in the next section. It leads to an increase in basis risk. Define 
S2* as the price of the asset underlying the futures contract at time t2. As before, S2 is  
the price of the asset being hedged at time t2. By hedging, a company ensures that the 
price that will be paid (or received) for the asset is
S2+F1-F2
This can be written as
F1+1S2*-F22+1S2-S2*2
The terms S2*-F2 and S2-S2* represent the two components of the basis. The S2*-F2 
term is the basis that would exist if the asset being hedged were the same as the asset underlying the futures contract. The 
S2-S2* term is the basis arising from the difference 
between the two assets.
M03_HULL0654_11_GE_C03.indd   77 30/04/2021   16:4478 CHAPTER 3
Choice of Contract
One key factor affecting basis risk is the choice of the futures contract to be used for 
hedging. This choice has two components:
1. The choice of the asset underlying the futures contract
2. The choice of the delivery month.
If the asset being hedged exactly matches an asset underlying a futures contract, the first choice is generally fairly easy. In other circumstances, it is necessary to carry out a  
careful analysis to determine which of the available futures contracts has futures prices that are most closely correlated with the price of the asset being hedged.
The choice of the delivery month is likely to be influenced by several factors. In the 
examples given earlier in this chapter, we assumed that, when the expiration of the hedge corresponds to a delivery month, the contract with that delivery month is chosen. In fact, a contract with a later delivery month is usually chosen in these circumstances. The reason is that futures prices are in some instances quite erratic during the delivery month. Moreover, a long hedger runs the risk of having to take delivery of the physical asset if the contract is held during the delivery month. Taking delivery can be expensive and inconvenient. (Long hedgers normally prefer to close out the futures contract and buy the asset from their usual suppliers.)
In general, basis risk increases as the time difference between the hedge expiration 
and the delivery month increases. A good rule of thumb is therefore to choose a  
delivery month that is as close as possible to, but later than, the expiration of the hedge. Suppose delivery months are March, June, September, and December for a futures contract on a particular asset. For hedge expirations in December, January, and February, the March contract will be chosen; for hedge expirations in March, April, and May, the June contract will be chosen; and so on. This rule of thumb assumes that there is sufficient liquidity in all contracts to meet the hedger’s  
requirements. In practice, liquidity tends to be greatest in short-maturity futures  
contracts. Therefore, in some situations, the hedger may be inclined to use short-  
maturity contracts and roll them forward. This strategy is discussed later in the chapter.
Example 3.1
It is March 1. A U.S. company expects to receive 50 million Japanese yen at the 
end of July. Yen futures contracts on the CME Group have delivery months of March, June, September, and December. One contract is for the delivery of  
12.5 million yen. The company therefore shorts four September yen futures con-tracts on March 1. When the yen are received at the end of July, the company  
closes out its position. We suppose that the futures price on March 1 in cents per yen is 1.0800 and that the spot and futures prices when the contract is closed out are 1.0200 and 1.0250, respectively.
The gain on the futures contract is 
1.0800-1.0250=0.0550 cents per yen. The 
basis is 1.0200-1.0250=-0.0050 cents per yen when the contract is closed out. 
The effective price obtained in cents per yen is the final spot price plus the gain on the futures:
1.0200+0.0550=1.0750
M03_HULL0654_11_GE_C03.indd   78 30/04/2021   16:44Hedging Strategies Using Futures 79
This can also be written as the initial futures price plus the final basis:
1.0800+1-0.00502=1.0750
The total amount received by the company for the 50 million yen is 50*0.01075 
million dollars, or $537,500.
Example 3.2
It is June 8 and a company knows that it will need to purchase 20,000 barrels of 
crude oil at some time in October or November. Oil futures contracts are currently traded for delivery every month by the CME Group and the contract size is 1,000 barrels. The company therefore decides to use the December contract for hedging and takes a long position in 20 December contracts. The futures price on June 8 is $48.00 per barrel. The company finds that it is ready to purchase the crude oil on November 10. It therefore closes out its futures contract on that date. The spot price and futures price on November 10 are $50.00 per barrel and $49.10 per  
barrel.
The gain on the futures contract is 
49.10-48.00=+1.10 per barrel. The basis 
when the contract is closed out is 50.00-49.10=+0.90 per barrel. The effective 
price paid (in dollars per barrel) is the final spot price less the gain on the  
futures, or
50.00-1.10=48.90
This can also be calculated as the initial futures price plus the final basis,
48.00+0.90=48.90
The total price paid is 48.90*20,000=+978,000.
In Examples 3.1 and 3.2, the asset underlying the futures contract was the same as the asset whose price is being hedged. Cross hedging occurs when the two assets are  
different. Consider, for example, an airline that is concerned about the future price  
of jet fuel. Because jet fuel futures are not actively traded, it might choose to use heating oil futures contracts to hedge its exposure.
The hedge ratio is the ratio of the size of the position taken in futures contracts to the 
size of the exposure. When the asset underlying the futures contract is the same as the asset being hedged, it is natural to use a hedge ratio of 1.0. This is the hedge ratio we have used in the examples considered so far. For instance, in Example 3.2, the hedger’s exposure was on 20,000 barrels of oil, and futures contracts were entered into for the delivery of exactly this amount of oil.
When cross hedging is used, setting the hedge ratio equal to 1.0 is not always  
optimal. The hedger should choose a value for the hedge ratio that minimizes the  
variance of the value of the hedged position. We now consider how the hedger can  
do this.3.4 CROSS HEDGING
M03_HULL0654_11_GE_C03.indd   79 30/04/2021   16:4480 CHAPTER 3
Calculating the Minimum Variance Hedge Ratio
We first present an analysis assuming no daily settlement of futures contracts. The  
minimum variance hedge ratio depends on the relationship between changes in the spot 
price and changes in the futures price. Define:
∆S: Change in spot price, S, during a period of time equal to the life of the hedge
∆F: Change in futures price, F , during a period of time equal to the life of the hedge.
If we assume that the relationship between ∆S and ∆F is approximately linear (see 
Figure 3.2), we can write:
∆S=a+b∆F+P
where a and b are constants and P is an error term. Suppose that the hedge ratio is h  
(i.e., a percentage h of the exposure to S is hedged with futures). Then the change in the value of the position per unit of exposure to S is
∆S-h∆F=a+1b-h2∆F+P
The standard deviation of this is minimized by setting h=b (so that the second term on  
the right-hand side disappears).
Denote the minimum variance hedge ratio by h*. We have shown that h*=b. It 
follows from the formula for the slope in linear regression that
 h*=rsS
sF (3.1)
DFDSFigure 3.2 Regression of change in spot price against change in futures price.
M03_HULL0654_11_GE_C03.indd   80 30/04/2021   16:44Hedging Strategies Using Futures 81
where sS is the standard deviation of ∆S, sF is the standard deviation of ∆F, and r is 
the coefficient of correlation between the two.
Equation (3.1) shows that the optimal hedge ratio is the product of the coefficient of 
correlation between ∆S and ∆F and the ratio of the standard deviation of ∆S to the 
standard deviation of ∆F. Figure 3.3 shows how the variance of the value of the  
hedger’s position depends on the hedge ratio chosen.
If r=1 and sF=sS, the hedge ratio, h*, is 1.0. This result is to be expected, because 
in this case the futures price mirrors the spot price perfectly. If r=1 and sF=2sS, the 
hedge ratio h* is 0.5. This result is also as expected, because in this case the futures price 
always changes by twice as much as the spot price. The hedge effectiveness can be  
defined as the proportion of the variance that is eliminated by hedging. This is the R2 
from the regression of ∆S against ∆F and equals r2.
The parameters r, sF, and sS in equation (3.1) are usually estimated from historical 
data on ∆S and ∆F. (The implicit assumption is that the future will in some sense be 
like the past.) A number of equal nonoverlapping time intervals are chosen, and the 
values of ∆S and ∆F for each of the intervals are observed. Ideally, the length of each 
time interval is the same as the length of the time interval for which the hedge is in effect. In practice, this sometimes severely limits the number of observations that are available, and a shorter time interval is used.
Optimal Number of Contracts
To calculate the number of contracts that should be used in hedging, define:
 QA: Size of position being hedged (units)
 QF: Size of one futures contract (units)
 N*: Optimal number of futures contracts for hedging.
The futures contracts should be on h*QA units of the asset. The number of futures  
contracts required is therefore given by
 N*=h*QA
QF (3.2)Hedge ratio
h*Variance of

Example 3.3 shows how the results in this section can be used by an airline hedging the 
purchase of jet fuel.3
Example 3.3
An airline expects to purchase 2 million gallons of jet fuel in 1 month and decides 
to use heating oil futures for hedging. We suppose that Table 3.2 gives, for  
15 successive months, data on the change, ∆S, in the jet fuel price per gallon  
and the corresponding change, ∆F, in the futures price for the contract on  
heating oil that would be used for hedging price changes during the month. In  
this case, the usual formulas for calculating standard deviations and correlations give 
sF=0.0313, sS=0.0263, and r=0.928.
From equation (3.1), the minimum variance hedge ratio, h*, is therefore
0.928*0.0263
0.0313=0.78
Each heating oil contract traded by the CME Group is on 42,000 gallons of  
heating oil. From equation (3.2), the optimal number of contracts is
0.78*2,000,000
42,000
which is 37 when rounded to the nearest whole number.
3 Derivatives with payoffs dependent on the price of jet fuel do exist, but heating oil futures are often used to 
hedge an exposure to jet fuel prices because they are traded more actively.Table 3.2 Data to calculate minimum variance hedge ratio when

Impact of Daily Settlement
The analysis we have presented so far is appropriate when forward contracts are used 
for hedging. The daily settlement of futures contract means that, when futures contracts are used, there are a series of one-day hedges, not a single hedge. Define:
s
nS: Standard deviation of percentage one-day changes in the spot price
snF: Standard deviation of percentage one day changes in the futures price
rn: Correlation between percentage one-day changes in the spot and futures.
The standard deviation of one-day changes in spot and futures are snSS and snFF. Also,  
rn is the correlation between one-day changes. It follows from equation (3.1) that the 
optimal one-day hedge is
h*=rnsnSS
snFF
so that from equation (3.2)
N*=rnsnSSQA
snFFQF
The hedge ratio in equation (3.1) is based on regressing actual changes in spot prices against actual changes in futures prices. An alternative hedge ratio, 
hn, can be derived in 
the same way by regressing daily percentage changes in spot against daily percentage changes in futures:
hn=rnsnS
snF
Then
 N*=hnVA
VF (3.3)
where VA=SQA is the value of the position being hedged and VF=FQF is the futures 
price times the size of one contract.
Consider another situation where 2 million gallons of jet fuel is being hedged with  
heating oil futures. Suppose that the spot and futures price are 1.10 and 1.30, respectively.  
In this case, VA=2, 000, 000*1.10=2, 200, 000 while VF=42,000*1.30=54,600. If  
rn=0.8, the optimal number of contracts for a one-day hedge is
0.8*2,200,000
54,600=32.23
or 32 when rounded to the nearest whole number. The optimal hedge is liable to change 
from day to day as the relative values of spot and futures prices change. But the changes are usually small and often ignored.
The analysis can be refined by taking account of the the interest that is earned or paid 
over the remaining life of the hedge. Suppose that the interest rate is 5% per annum and the hedge has a remaining life of one year. It is then appropriate to divide 
N* by 1.05. 
This is referred to as tailing the hedge.
M03_HULL0654_11_GE_C03.indd   83 30/04/2021   16:4484 CHAPTER 3
We now move on to consider stock index futures and how they are used to hedge or 
manage exposures to equity prices.
A stock index tracks changes in the value of a hypothetical portfolio of stocks. The 
weight of a stock in the portfolio at a particular time equals the proportion of the  
hypothetical portfolio invested in the stock at that time. The percentage increase in the stock index over a small interval of time is set equal to the percentage increase in the  
value of the hypothetical portfolio. Dividends are usually not included in the calcula-tion so that the index tracks the capital gain/loss from investing in the portfolio.
4
If the hypothetical portfolio of stocks remains fixed, the weights assigned to individual 
stocks in the portfolio do not remain fixed. When the price of one particular stock in the portfolio rises more sharply than others, more weight is automatically given to that stock. Sometimes indices are constructed from a hypothetical portfolio consisting of one of each of a number of stocks. The weights assigned to the stocks are then proportional to their market prices, with adjustments being made when there are stock splits. Other indices are constructed so that weights are proportional to market capitalization (stock price
*number of shares outstanding). The underlying portfolio is then automatically 
adjusted to reflect stock splits, stock dividends, and new equity issues.
Stock Indices
Table 3.3 shows futures prices for contracts on three different stock indices on  
May 21, 2021.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is based on a portfolio consisting of 30 blue-chip 
stocks in the United States. The weights given to the stocks are proportional to their prices. The CME Group trades two futures contracts on the index. One is on $10 times 3.5 STOCK INDEX FUTURES
4 An exception to this is a total return index. This is calculated by assuming that dividends on the  
hypothetical portfolio are reinvested in the portfolio.Table 3.3 Futures quotes for a selection of CME Group contracts on stock indices

Mini contract trades most actively.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 (S&P 500) Index is based on a portfolio of 500 different 
stocks: 400 industrials, 40 utilities, 20 transportation companies, and 40 financial  
institutions. The weights of the stocks in the portfolio at any given time are proportional 
to their market capitalizations. The stocks are those of large publicly held companies that trade on NYSE Euronext or Nasdaq OMX. The CME Group trades two futures contracts on the S&P 500. One is on $250 times the index; the other (the Mini S&P 500 contract) is on $50 times the index. The Mini contract trades most actively.
The Nasdaq-100 is based on a portfolio of 100 stocks traded on the Nasdaq exchange 
with weights proportional to market capitalizations. The CME Group trades two  
futures contracts. One is on $100 times the index; the other (the Mini Nasdaq-100  
contract) is on $20 times the index. The Mini contract trades most actively.
Some futures contracts on indices outside the United States are also traded actively. 
An example is the contract on the CSI 300 index, a market-capitalization-weighted index of 300 Chinese stocks, which trades on the China Financial Futures Exchange (CFFEX, www.cffex.com.cn).
As mentioned in Chapter 2, futures contracts on stock indices are settled in cash, not 
by delivery of the underlying asset. All contracts are marked to market to either the opening price or the closing price of the index on the last trading day, and the positions are then deemed to be closed. For example, contracts on the S&P 500 are closed out at the opening price of the S&P 500 index on the third Friday of the delivery month.
Hedging an Equity Portfolio
Stock index futures can be used to hedge a well-diversified equity portfolio. Define:
VA: Current value of the portfolio
VF: Current value of one futures contract (the futures price times the contract size).
If the portfolio mirrors the index, the optimal hedge ratio can be assumed to be 1.0 and equation (3.3) shows that the number of futures contracts that should be shorted is
 
N*=VA
VF (3.4)
Suppose, for example, that a portfolio worth $5,050,000 mirrors a well-diversified index. 
The index futures price is 1,010 and each futures contract is on $250 times the index. In this case 
VA=5,050,000 and VF=1,010*250=252,500, so that 20 contracts should 
be shorted to hedge the portfolio.
When the portfolio does not mirror the index, we can use the capital asset pricing 
model (see the appendix to this chapter). The parameter beta 1b2 from the capital  
asset pricing model is the slope of the best-fit line obtained when excess return on the portfolio over the risk-free rate is regressed against the excess return of the index over the risk-free rate. When 
b=1.0, the return on the portfolio tends to mirror the return 
on the index; when b=2.0, the excess return on the portfolio tends to be twice as  
great as the excess return on the index; when b=0.5, it tends to be half as great; and 
so on.
A portfolio with a b of 2.0 is twice as sensitive to movements in the index as a  
portfolio with a beta 1.0. It is therefore necessary to use twice as many contracts to 
M03_HULL0654_11_GE_C03.indd   85 30/04/2021   16:4486 CHAPTER 3
hedge the portfolio. Similarly, a portfolio with a beta of 0.5 is half as sensitive to  
market movements as a portfolio with a beta of 1.0 and we should use half as many 
contracts to hedge it. In general,
 N*=bVA
VF (3.5)
This formula assumes that the maturity of the futures contract is close to the maturity 
of the hedge.
Comparing equation (3.5) with equation (3.3), we see that they imply hn=b. This is 
not surprising. The hedge ratio hn is the slope of the best-fit line when percentage one-
day changes in the portfolio are regressed against percentage one-day changes in the futures price of the index. Beta 
1b2 is the slope of the best-fit line when the return from 
the portfolio is regressed against the return for the index.
We illustrate that this formula gives good results by extending our earlier example. 
Suppose that a futures contract with 4 months to maturity is used to hedge the value of a portfolio over the next 3 months in the following situation:
Index level=1,000
Index futures price=1,010
Value of portfolio=+5,050,000
Risk@free interest rate=4, per annum
Dividend yield on index=1, per annum
Beta of portfolio=1.5
One futures contract is for delivery of $250 times the index. As before, VF = 
250*1,010=252,500. From equation (3.5), the number of futures contracts that should 
be shorted to hedge the portfolio is
1.5*5,050,000
252,500=30
Suppose the index turns out to be 900 in 3 months and the futures price is 902. The gain from the short futures position is then
30*11010-9022*250=+810,000
The loss on the index is 10%. The index pays a dividend of 1% per annum, or 0.25% per 3 months. When dividends are taken into account, an investor in the index would therefore earn 
-9.75, over the 3-month period. Because the portfolio has a b of 1.5, 
the capital asset pricing model gives
Expected return on portfolio-Risk@free interest rate
=1.5*1Return on index-Risk@free interest rate2
The risk-free interest rate is approximately 1% per 3 months. It follows that the expected return (%) on the portfolio during the 3 months when the 3-month return on the index is 
-9.75, is
1.0+31.5*1-9.75-1.024=-15.125
The expected value of the portfolio (inclusive of dividends) at the end of the 3 months is 
M03_HULL0654_11_GE_C03.indd   86 30/04/2021   16:44Hedging Strategies Using Futures 87
therefore
+5,050,000*11-0.151252=+4,286,187
It follows that the expected value of the hedger’s position, including the gain on the 
hedge, is
+4,286,187++810,000=+5,096,187
Table 3.4 summarizes these calculations together with similar calculations for other 
values of the index at maturity. It can be seen that the total expected value of the  
hedger’s position in 3 months is almost independent of the value of the index. This is what one would expect if the hedge is a good one.
The only thing we have not covered so far is the relationship between futures prices 
and spot prices. We will see in Chapter 5 that the 1,010 assumed for the futures price today is roughly what we would expect given the interest rate and dividend we are assuming. The same is true of the futures prices in 3 months shown in Table 3.4.
5
Reasons for Hedging an Equity Portfolio
Table 3.4 shows that the hedging procedure results in a value for the hedger’s position 
at the end of the 3-month period being about 1% higher than at the beginning of the 3-month period. There is no surprise here. The risk-free rate is 4% per annum, or 1% per 3 months. The hedge results in the investor’s position growing at the risk-free rate.
It is natural to ask why the hedger should go to the trouble of using futures contracts. 
To earn the risk-free interest rate, the hedger can simply sell the portfolio and invest the proceeds in a risk-free security.
One answer to this question is that hedging can be justified if the hedger feels that 
the stocks in the portfolio have been chosen well. In these circumstances, the hedger might be very uncertain about the performance of the market as a whole, but  Table 3.4 Performance of stock index hedge.

5 The calculations in Table 3.4 assume that the dividend yield on the index is predictable, the risk-free interest 
rate remains constant, and the return on the index over the 3-month period is perfectly correlated with the 
return on the portfolio. In practice, these assumptions do not hold perfectly, and the hedge works rather less well than is indicated by Table 3.4.
M03_HULL0654_11_GE_C03.indd   87 30/04/2021   16:4488 CHAPTER 3
confident that the stocks in the portfolio will outperform the market (after appropriate 
adjustments have been made for the beta of the portfolio). A hedge using index futures removes the risk arising from market moves and leaves the hedger exposed only to the performance of the portfolio relative to the market. This will be discussed further shortly. Another reason for hedging may be that the hedger is planning to hold a  
portfolio for a long period of time and requires short-term protection in an uncertain market situation. The alternative strategy of selling the portfolio and buying it back later might involve unacceptably high transaction costs.
Changing the Beta of a Portfolio
In the example in Table 3.4, the beta of the hedger’s portfolio is reduced to zero so that 
the hedger’s expected return is almost independent of the performance of the index. Sometimes futures contracts are used to change the beta of a portfolio to some value other than zero. Continuing with our earlier example:
Index level=1,000
Index futures price=1,010
Value of portfolio=+5,050,000
Beta of portfolio=1.5
As before, VF=250*1,010=252,500 and a complete hedge requires
1.5*5,050,000
252,500=30
contracts to be shorted. To reduce the beta of the portfolio from 1.5 to 0.75, the  
number of contracts shorted should be 15 rather than 30; to increase the beta of the portfolio to 2.0, a long position in 10 contracts should be taken; and so on. In general, to change the beta of the portfolio from 
b to b*, where b7b*, a short position in
1b-b*2VA
VF
contracts is required. When b6b*, a long position in
1b*-b2VA

Locking in the Benefits of Stock Picking
Suppose you consider yourself to be good at picking stocks that will outperform the market. You own a single stock or a small portfolio of stocks. You do not know how  
well the market will perform over the next few months, but you are confident that your portfolio will do better than the market. What should you do?
You should short 
bVA>VF index futures contracts, where b is the beta of your  
portfolio, VA is the total value of the portfolio, and VF is the current value of one  
index futures contract. If your portfolio performs better than a well-diversified portfolio with the same beta, you will then make money.
M03_HULL0654_11_GE_C03.indd   88 30/04/2021   16:44Hedging Strategies Using Futures 89
Consider an investor who in April holds 20,000 shares of a company, each worth $100. 
The investor feels that the market will be very volatile over the next three months but that 
the company has a good chance of outperforming the market. The investor decides to use the August futures contract on the Mini S&P 500 to hedge the market’s return during the three-month period. The 
b of the company’s stock is estimated at 1.1. Suppose that the 
current futures price for the August contract on the Mini S&P 500 is 2,100. Each contract is for delivery of $50 times the index. In this case, 
VA=20,000*100=2,000,000 and 
VF=2,100*50=105,000. The number of contracts that should be shorted is therefore
1.1*2,000,000
105,000=20.95
Rounding to the nearest integer, the investor shorts 21 contracts, closing out the position in July. Suppose the company’s stock price falls to $90 and the futures price of the  
Mini S&P 500 falls to 1,850. The investor loses 
20,000*1$100-$902=+200,000 on the  
stock, while gaining 21*50*12,100-1,8502=+262,500 on the futures contracts.
The overall gain to the investor in this case is $62,500 because the company’s stock 
price did not go down by as much as a well-diversified portfolio with a b of 1.1. If the 
market had gone up and the company’s stock price went up by more than a portfolio with a 
b of 1.1 (as expected by the investor), then a profit would be made in this case  
as well.
Sometimes the expiration date of the hedge is later than the delivery dates of all the futures contracts that can be used. The hedger must then roll the hedge forward by closing out one futures contract and taking the same position in a futures contract with a later delivery date. Hedges can be rolled forward many times. The procedure is known as stack and roll. Consider a company that wishes to use a short hedge to reduce the risk 
associated with the price to be received for an asset at time T. If there are futures  
contracts 1, 2, 3,  .  .  .  , n (not all necessarily in existence at the present time) with  
progressively later delivery dates, the company can use the following strategy:
Time 
t1: Short futures contract 1
Time t2: Close out futures contract 1
 Short futures contract 2
Time t3: Close out futures contract 2
 Short futures contract 3
f
Time tn: Close out futures contract n-1
 Short futures contract n
Time T:  Close out futures contract n.
Suppose that in April 2021 a company realizes that it will have 100,000 barrels of oil to 
sell in June 2022 and decides to hedge its risk with a hedge ratio of 1.0. (In this example, we do not make the adjustment for daily settlement described in Section 3.4.) The current spot price is $49. Although futures contracts are traded with maturities stretching several 3.6 STACK AND ROLL
M03_HULL0654_11_GE_C03.indd   89 30/04/2021   16:4490 CHAPTER 3
years into the future, we suppose that only the first six delivery months have sufficient 
liquidity to meet the company’s needs. The company therefore shorts 100 October 2021 contracts. In September 2021, it rolls the hedge forward into the March 2022 contract. In February 2022, it rolls the hedge forward again into the July 2022 contract.
One possible outcome is shown in Table 3.5. The October 2021 contract is shorted  
at $48.20 per barrel and closed out at $47.40 per barrel for a profit of $0.80 per barrel; the March 2022 contract is shorted at $47.00 per barrel and closed out at $46.50 per barrel for a profit of $0.50 per barrel. The July 2022 contract is shorted at $46.30 per barrel and closed out at $45.90 per barrel for a profit of $0.40 per barrel. The final  
spot price is $46.
The dollar gain per barrel of oil from the short futures contracts is
148.20-47.402+147.00-46.502+146.30-45.902=1.70
The oil price declined from $49 to $46. Receiving only $1.70 per barrel compensation for a price decline of $3.00 may appear unsatisfactory. However, we cannot expect total compensation for a price decline when futures prices are below spot prices. The best we can hope for is to lock in the futures price that would apply to a June 2022 contract if it were actively traded.
In practice, a company usually has an exposure every month to the underlying asset  
and uses a 1 -month futures contract for hedging because it is the most liquid. Initially it  
enters into (“stacks”) sufficient contracts to cover its exposure to the end of its hedging horizon. One month later, it closes out all the contracts and “rolls” them into new 1 -month contracts to cover its new exposure, and so on.
As described in Business Snapshot 3.2, a German company, Metallgesellschaft,  
followed this strategy in the early 1990s to hedge contracts it had entered into to supply commodities at a fixed price. It ran into difficulties because the prices of the commod-ities declined so that there were immediate cash outflows on the futures and the  
expectation of eventual gains on the contracts. This mismatch between the timing of  
the cash flows on hedge and the timing of the cash flows from the position being hedged led to liquidity problems that could not be handled. The moral of the story is that  
potential liquidity problems should always be considered when a hedging strategy is being planned.
SUMMARY
This chapter has discussed various ways in which a company can take a position in futures contracts to offset an exposure to the price of an asset. If the exposure is such Table 3.5 Data for the example on rolling oil hedge forward.

that the company gains when the price of the asset increases and loses when the price of 
the asset decreases, a short hedge is appropriate. If the exposure is the other way round (i.e., the company gains when the price of the asset decreases and loses when the price of the asset increases), a long hedge is appropriate.
Hedging is a way of reducing risk. As such, it should be welcomed by most  
executives. In reality, there are a number of theoretical and practical reasons why companies do not hedge. On a theoretical level, we can argue that shareholders, by holding well-diversified portfolios, can eliminate many of the risks faced by a company. They do not require the company to hedge these risks. On a practical level, a company may find that it is increasing rather than decreasing risk by hedging if none of its competitors does so. Also, a treasurer may fear criticism from other executives if the company makes a gain from movements in the price of the underlying asset and a loss on the hedge.
An important concept in hedging is basis risk. The basis is the difference between the 
spot price of an asset and its futures price. Basis risk arises from uncertainty as to what the basis will be at maturity of the hedge.
The hedge ratio is the ratio of the size of the position taken in futures contracts to the 
size of the exposure. It is not always optimal to use a hedge ratio of 1.0. If the hedger wishes to minimize the variance of a position, a hedge ratio different from 1.0 may be appropriate. The optimal hedge ratio is the slope of the best-fit line obtained when changes in the spot price are regressed against changes in the futures price.
Stock index futures can be used to hedge the systematic risk in an equity portfolio. 
The number of futures contracts required is the beta of the portfolio multiplied by the ratio of the value of the portfolio to the value of one futures contract. Stock index futures can also be used to change the beta of a portfolio without changing the stocks that make up the portfolio.
When there is no liquid futures contract that matures later than the expiration of the 
hedge, a strategy known as stack and roll may be appropriate. This involves entering into a sequence of futures contracts. When the first futures contract is near expiration, it Business Snapshot 3.2 Metallgesellschaft: Hedging Gone Awry
Sometimes rolling hedges forward can lead to cash flow pressures. The problem was illustrated dramatically by the activities of a German company, Metallgesellschaft (MG), in the early 1990s.
MG sold a huge volume of 5- to 10-year heating oil and gasoline fixed-price  
supply contracts to its customers at 6 to 8 cents above market prices. It hedged its exposure with long positions in short-dated futures contracts that were rolled  
forward. As it turned out, the price of oil fell and there were margin calls on the futures positions. Considerable short-term cash flow pressures were placed on MG. The members of MG who devised the hedging strategy argued that these short-term cash outflows were offset by positive cash flows that would ultimately be realized on the long-term fixed-price contracts. However, the company’s senior management and its bankers became concerned about the huge cash drain. As a result, the  
company closed out all the hedge positions and agreed with its customers that the fixed-price contracts would be abandoned. The outcome was a loss to MG of  
$1.33 billion.

is closed out and the hedger enters into a second contract with a later delivery month. 
When the second contract is close to expiration, it is closed out and the hedger enters into a third contract with a later delivery month; and so on. The result of all this is the creation of a long-dated futures contract by trading a series of short-dated contracts.

APPENDIX 
CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL
The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is a model that can be used to relate the 
expected return from an asset to the risk of the return. The risk in the return from an asset is divided into two parts. Systematic risk is risk related to the return from the  
market as a whole and cannot be diversified away. Nonsystematic risk is risk that is unique to the asset and can be diversified away by choosing a large portfolio of different assets. CAPM argues that the return should depend only on systematic risk. The CAPM formula is
6
 Expected return on asset=RF+b1RM-RF2 (3A.1)
where RM is the return on the portfolio of all available investments, RF is the return on 
a risk-free investment, and b (the Greek letter beta) is a parameter measuring  
systematic risk.
The return from the portfolio of all available investments, RM, is referred to as the 
return on the market and is usually approximated as the return on a well-diversified stock index such as the S&P 500. The beta 
1b2 of an asset is a measure of the sensitivity 
of its returns to returns from the market. It can be estimated from historical data as the slope obtained when the excess return on the asset over the risk-free rate is regressed against the excess return on the market over the risk-free rate. When 
b=0, an asset’s 
returns are not sensitive to returns from the market. In this case, it has no systematic risk and equation (3A.1) shows that its expected return is the risk-free rate; when 
b=0.5, the excess return on the asset over the risk-free rate is on average half of the 
excess return of the market over the risk-free rate; when b=1, the expected return on 
the asset equals to the return on the market; and so on.
Suppose that the risk-free rate RF is 5% and the return on the market is 13%.  
Equation (3A.1) shows that, when the beta of an asset is zero, its expected return is 5%. When 
b=0.75, its expected return is 0.05+0.75*10.13-0.052=0.11, or 11%.
The derivation of CAPM requires a number of assumptions.7 In particular:
1. Investors care only about the expected return and standard deviation of the return from an asset.
2. The returns from two assets are correlated with each other only because of their 
correlation with the return from the market. This is equivalent to assuming that there is only one factor driving returns.
3. Investors focus on returns over a single period and that period is the same for all investors.
4. Investors can borrow and lend at the same risk-free rate.
5. Tax does not influence investment decisions.
6. All investors make the same estimates of expected returns, standard deviations of 
returns, and correlations between returns.
6 If the return on the market is not known, RM is replaced by the expected value of RM in this formula.
7 For details on the derivation, see, for example, J. C. Hull, Risk Management and Financial Institutions,  
5th edn. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2018, Chap. 1.
M03_HULL0654_11_GE_C03.indd   96 30/04/2021   16:44Hedging Strategies Using Futures 97
These assumptions are at best only approximately true. Nevertheless CAPM has proved 
to be a useful tool for portfolio managers and is often used as a benchmark for  
assessing their performance.
When the asset is an individual stock, the expected return given by equation (3A.1) is 
not a particularly good predictor of the actual return. But, when the asset is a well-  
diversified portfolio of stocks, it is a much better predictor. As a result, the equation
Return on diversified portfolio=RF+b1RM-RF2
can be used as a basis for hedging a diversified portfolio, as described in Section 3.5.  
The b in the equation is the beta of the portfolio. It can be calculated as the weighted 
average of the betas of the stocks in the portfolio.

Interest Rates4 CHAPTER  
Interest rates are a factor in the valuation of virtually all derivatives and will feature 
prominently in much of the material that will be presented in the rest of this book. This  
chapter introduces a number of different types of interest rate. It deals with some fundamental issues concerned with the way interest rates are measured and analyzed. It explains the compounding frequency used to define an interest rate and the meaning of continuously compounded interest rates, which are used extensively in the analysis of  
derivatives. It covers zero rates, par yields, and yield curves, discusses bond pricing, and  
outlines a “bootstrap” procedure commonly used to calculate zero-coupon interest rates. It also covers forward rates and forward rate agreements and reviews different theories of the term structure of interest rates. Finally, it explains the use of duration and convexity measures to determine the sensitivity of bond prices to interest rate changes. 
Chapter 6 will cover interest rate futures and show how the duration measure can be  
used when interest rate exposures are hedged. For ease of exposition, day count conventions will be ignored throughout this chapter. The nature of these conventions and their impact on calculations will be discussed in Chapters 6 and 7 .
4.1 TYPES OF RATES
An interest rate in a particular situation defines the amount of money a borrower promises to pay the lender. For any given currency, many different types of interest rates  
are regularly quoted. These include mortgage rates, deposit rates, prime borrowing rates, and so on. One important factor influencing interest rates is credit risk. This is the  
risk that there will be a default by the borrower of funds, so that the interest and principal are not paid to the lender as promised. The higher the credit risk, the higher the interest rate that is promised by the borrower. The extra amount added to a risk-free interest rate to allow for credit risk is known as a credit spread.
Interest rates are often expressed in basis points. One basis point is 0.01% per annum.
Treasury Rates
Treasury rates are the rates an investor earns on Treasury bills and Treasury bonds. These are the instruments used by a government to borrow in its own currency. Japanese Treasury rates are the rates at which the Japanese government borrows in yen; U.S. Treasury rates are the rates at which the U.S. government borrows in U.S. dollars; and 
M04_HULL0654_11_GE_C04.indd   98 12/05/2021   17:18Interest Rates 99
so on. It is usually assumed that there is no chance that the government of a developed 
country will default on an obligation denominated in its own currency. A developed  
country’s Treasury rates are therefore regarded as risk-free in the sense that an investor  
who buys a Treasury bill or Treasury bond is certain that interest and principal  
payments will be made as promised.
Overnight Rates
Banks are required to maintain a certain amount of cash, known as a reserve, with the central bank. The reserve requirement for a bank at any time depends on its outstanding assets and liabilities. At the end of a day, some financial institutions typically have surplus funds in their accounts with the central bank while others have requirements for  
funds. This leads to borrowing and lending overnight. A broker usually matches borrowers and lenders. In the United States, the central bank is the Federal Reserve (often referred to as the Fed) and the overnight rate is called the federal funds rate. The weighted average of the rates in brokered transactions (with weights being determined by  
the size of the transaction) is termed the effective federal funds rate. This overnight rate is  
monitored by the Federal Reserve, which may intervene with its own transactions in an attempt to raise or lower it. Other countries have similar systems to the United States. For example, in the United Kingdom, the average of brokered overnight rates is the sterling overnight index average (SONIA); in the eurozone, it is the euro short-term rate (ESTER);
1 in Switzerland, it is the Swiss average rate overnight (SARON); in Japan, it is  
the Tokyo overnight average rate (TONAR).
Repo Rates
Unlike the overnight federal funds rate, repo rates are secured borrowing rates. In a repo (or repurchase agreement), a financial institution that owns securities agrees to sell the securities for a certain price and buy them back at a later time for a slightly higher price. The financial institution is obtaining a loan and the interest it pays is the difference between the price at which the securities are sold and the price at which they are repurchased. The interest rate is referred to as the repo rate.
If structured carefully, a repo involves very little credit risk. If the borrower does not 
honor the agreement, the lending company simply keeps the securities. If the lending company does not keep to its side of the agreement, the original owner of the securities keeps the cash provided by the lending company. The most common type of repo is an overnight repo, where funds are lent overnight. However, longer-term arrangements, known as term repos, are sometimes used. Because it is a secured rate, a repo rate is theoretically very slightly below the corresponding fed funds rate.
The secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) is an important volume-weighted median  
average of the rates on overnight repo transactions in the United States.
1 ESTER replaces the euro overnight index average (EONIA).4.2 REFERENCE RATES
Reference interest rates are important in financial markets. The parties to transactions frequently enter into contracts where the future interest rate paid or received is  
uncertain, but will be set equal the value of an agreed reference interest rate.
M04_HULL0654_11_GE_C04.indd   99 12/05/2021   17:18100 CHAPTER 4
LIBOR
LIBOR is short for London Interbank Offered Rate. It has historically been a very 
important reference rate. LIBOR rates have been compiled by asking a panel of global banks to provide quotes estimating the unsecured rates of interest at which they could borrow from other banks just prior to 11 a.m. (U.K. time). Several different currencies and several different borrowing periods (ranging from one day to one year) were considered. The banks submitting quotes typically had good credit ratings. LIBOR rates were therefore considered to be estimates of unsecured borrowing rates for  
creditworthy banks.
LIBOR rates have served as reference rates for hundreds of trillions of dollars of 
transactions throughout the world. For example, the borrowing rate on a five-year loan in a particular situation might be specified as three-month LIBOR plus 30 basis points (i.e., three-month LIBOR plus 0.3%). The value of three-month LIBOR would then be noted at the beginning of each three-month period and interest based on this LIBOR rate would be paid by the borrower at the end of the period.
A problem with LIBOR is that there is not enough borrowing between banks for a  
bank’s estimates to be determined by market transactions. As a result, LIBOR sub- missions by banks involved a certain amount of judgment and could be subject to manipulation. Bank regulators are uncomfortable with this and have developed plans to phase out the use of LIBOR. Originally, the deadline for LIBOR to be discontinued was the end of 2021, but quotes may continue for a period after that to make it easier to deal with the existing contracts that depend on LIBOR.
The New Reference Rates
The plan is to base reference rates on the overnight rates we have mentioned. For example, the new reference rate in the United States will be SOFR; in the U.K., it will be SONIA; in the eurozone, it will be ESTER; in Switzerland, it will be SARON; in Japan, it will be TONAR. (Note that the overnight rate in the U.S. will be a secured overnight rate because it is a repo rate; the overnight rate in other countries will be  
unsecured because, as explained earlier, they are determined from the overnight transactions between banks when they manage reserves.)
Longer rates such as three-month rates, six-month rates, or one-year rates can be 
determined from overnight rates by compounding them daily. In the case of SOFR, there are assumed to be 360 days per year. (See Chapter 6 for a discussion of day count conventions) Suppose that the (annualized) SOFR overnight rate on the ith business day of a period is 
ri 11…i…n2 and the rate applies to di days. The (annualized) interest 
rate for the period is
311+r1dn1211+r2dn22c 11+rndnn2-14*360
D
where dni=di>360 and D=aidi is the number of days in the period. On most days 
di=1, but weekends and holidays lead to the overnight rates being applied to more 
than one day. (For example, on a Friday di will normally be equal to 3.)
The new reference rates are regarded as risk-free because they are derived from one- 
day loans to creditworthy financial institutions. LIBOR, by contrast, incorporates a credit spread. There is another important difference between the old and new reference 
M04_HULL0654_11_GE_C04.indd   100 12/05/2021   17:18Interest Rates 101
rates. LIBOR rates are forward looking. They are determined at the beginning of the 
period to which they will apply. The new reference rates are backward looking. The rate applicable to a particular period is not known until the end of the period when all the  
relevant overnight rates have been observed.
As we will discuss in Chapter 7 , swaps are a way in which short-term interest rates 
can be used to determine the equivalent interest rates that apply to relatively long periods.
Reference Rates and Credit Risk
One problem faced by banks is that credit spreads in the economy increase in stressed market conditions. For example, the spread between three-month LIBOR and a three-month rate based on overnight rates is usually about 10 basis points (0.1%), but it can be much higher in stressed market conditions. For example, it spiked to an all-time  
high of 364 basis points (3.64%) in the United States in October 2008 during the  
financial crisis. If a bank offers a loan at a reference rate plus x%, where x is a constant, 
it would like the rate to reflect ups and downs in average credit spreads. LIBOR, when  
used as a reference rate, did this, but the new reference rates (because they are  
essentially risk-free) do not. This has led banks to ask for a way of creating risky reference rates by adding a credit spread to the new reference rates. There have been a number of proposals and the new risk-free reference rates may be augmented by credit spread measures in the future.
4.3 THE RISK-FREE RATE
As we shall see, the usual approach to valuing derivatives involves setting up a riskless portfolio and arguing that the return on the portfolio should be the risk-free rate. The risk-free rate therefore plays a central role in derivatives pricing. It might be thought that derivatives traders would use the rates on Treasury bills and Treasury bonds as risk-free rates. In fact they do not do this. This is because there are tax and regulatory factors that lead to Treasury rates being artificially low. For example:
1. Banks are not required to keep capital for investments in a Treasury instruments, but they are required to keep capital for other very low risk instruments.
2. In the United States, Treasury instruments are given favorable tax treatment  compared with other very low risk instruments because the interest earned by 
investors is not taxed at the state level.
The risk-free reference rates created from from overnight rates (see Section 4.2) are the ones used in valuing derivatives.
4.4 MEASURING INTEREST RATES
A statement by a bank that the interest rate on one-year deposits is 10% per annum sounds straightforward and unambiguous. In fact, its precise meaning depends on the way the interest rate is measured.
M04_HULL0654_11_GE_C04.indd   101 12/05/2021   17:18102 CHAPTER 4
If the interest rate is measured with annual compounding, the bank’s statement that 
the interest rate is 10% means that $100 grows to
+100*1.1=+110
at the end of 1 year. When the interest rate is measured with semiannual compounding, 
it means that 5% is earned every 6 months, with the interest being reinvested. In this case, $100 grows to
+100*1.05*1.05=+110.25
at the end of 1 year. When the interest rate is measured with quarterly compounding, the bank’s statement means that 2.5% is earned every 3 months, with the interest being reinvested. The $100 then grows to
+100*1.0254=+110.38
at the end of 1 year. Table 4.1 shows the effect of increasing the compounding  frequency further.
The compounding frequency defines the units in which an interest rate is measured. A  
rate expressed with one compounding frequency can be converted into an equivalent rate with a different compounding frequency. For example, from Table 4.1 we see that 10.25% with annual compounding is equivalent to 10% with semiannual compound-ing. We can think of the difference between one compounding frequency and another to  
be analogous to the difference between kilometers and miles. They are two different units of measurement.
To generalize our results, suppose that an amount A is invested for n years at an 
interest rate of R per annum. If the rate is compounded once per annum, the terminal value of the investment is
A11+R2n
If the rate is compounded m times per annum, the terminal value of the investment is
 Aa1+R
mbmn
 (4.1)
When m=1, the rate is sometimes referred to as the equivalent annual interest rate.Compounding frequency Value of $100

Suppose R1 is an interest rate when compounding is m1 times per year and R2 is the  
equivalent rate when compounding is m2 times per year. From equation (4.1), the  
values of an investment of A after n years is the same if:
Aa1+R1
m1bm1n
=Aa1+R2
m2bm2n
This means that
R2=m2ca1+R1
m1bm1>m2
-1d
As an example of the application of this formula, suppose that an interest rate is 6% 
with semiannual compounding. The equivalent rate with quarterly compounding can be calculated by setting 
m1=2, R1=0.06, and m2=4. It is:
R2=4ca1+0.06
2b2>4
-1d=0.0596
or 5.96%.
Continuous Compounding
The limit as the compounding frequency, m, tends to infinity is known as continuous compounding.
2 With continuous compounding, it can be shown that an amount A 
invested for n years at rate R grows to
 AeRn (4.2)
where e is approximately 2.71828. The exponential function, ex, is built into most 
calculators, so the computation of the expression in equation (4.2) presents no problems. 
In the example in Table 4.1, A=100, n=1, and R=0.1, so that the value to which A 
grows with continuous compounding is
100e0.1=+110.52
This is (to two decimal places) the same as the value with daily compounding. For most practical purposes, continuous compounding can be thought of as being equivalent to daily compounding. Compounding a sum of money at a continuously compounded rate  
R for n years involves multiplying it by 
eRn. Discounting it at a continuously com-
pounded rate R for n years involves multiplying by e-Rn.
In this book, interest rates will be measured with continuous compounding except 
where stated otherwise. Readers used to working with interest rates that are measured with annual, semiannual, or some other compounding frequency may find this a little strange at first. However, continuously compounded interest rates are used to such a great extent in pricing derivatives that it makes sense to get used to working with them now.
Suppose that 
Rc is a rate of interest with continuous compounding and Rm is the  
equivalent rate with compounding m  times per annum. From the results in equa-
tions (4.1) and (4.2), we have
AeRcn=Aa1+Rm
mbmn
2 Actuaries sometimes refer to a continuously compounded rate as the force of interest.
M04_HULL0654_11_GE_C04.indd   103 12/05/2021   17:18104 CHAPTER 4
or
eRc=a1+Rm
mbm
This means that
 Rc=m ln a1+Rm
mb (4.3)
and
 Rm=m1eRc>m-12 (4.4)
These equations can be used to convert a rate with a compounding frequency of m times 
per annum to a continuously compounded rate and vice versa. The natural logarithm function ln x, which is built into most calculators, is the inverse of the exponential 
 function, so that, if 
y=ln x, then x=ey.
Example 4.1
Consider an interest rate that is quoted as 10% per annum with semiannual 
 compounding. From equation (4.3) with m=2 and Rm=0.1, the equivalent rate  
with continuous compounding is
2 ln a1+0.1
2b=0.09758
or 9.758% per annum.
Example 4.2
Suppose that a lender quotes the interest rate on loans as 8% per annum with 
continuous compounding, and that interest is actually paid quarterly. From equation (4.4) with 
m=4 and Rc=0.08, the equivalent rate with quarterly 
 compounding is
4*1e0.08>4-12=0.0808
or 8.08% per annum. This means that on a $1,000 loan, interest payments of $20.20 would be required each quarter.
4.5 ZERO RATES
The n-year zero-coupon interest rate is the rate of interest earned on an investment that  
starts today and lasts for n years. All the interest and principal is realized at the end of n years. There are no intermediate payments. The n-year zero-coupon interest rate is sometimes also referred to as the n-year spot rate, the n-year zero rate, or just the n -year 
zero. Suppose a 5-year zero rate with continuous compounding is quoted as 5% per annum. This means that $100, if invested for 5 years, grows to
100*e0.05*5=128.40
Most of the interest rates we observe directly in the market are not pure zero rates. Consider a 5-year risk-free bond that provides a 6% coupon (i.e., it pays interest at a rate of 6% per year). The price of this bond does not by itself determine the 5-year risk-free zero rate because some of the return on the bond is realized in the form of coupons 
M04_HULL0654_11_GE_C04.indd   104 12/05/2021   17:18Interest Rates 105
Most bonds pay coupons to the holder periodically. The bond’s principal (which is also 
known as its par value or face value) is paid at the end of its life. The theoretical price  
of a bond can be calculated as the present value of all the cash flows that will be  
received by the owner of the bond. Sometimes bond traders use the same discount rate  
for all the cash flows underlying a bond, but a more accurate approach is to use a  
different zero rate for each cash flow.
To illustrate this, consider the situation where zero rates, measured with continuous 
compounding, are as in Table 4.2. (We explain later how these can be calculated.) 
Suppose that a 2-year bond with a principal of $100 provides coupons at the rate of 6%  
per annum semiannually. To calculate the present value of the first coupon of $3, we  
discount it at 5.0% for 6 months; to calculate the present value of the second coupon of $3, we discount it at 5.8% for 1 year; and so on. Therefore, the theoretical price of the bond is
3e-0.05*0.5+3e-0.058*1.0+3e-0.064*1.5+103e-0.068*2.0=98.39
or $98.39. (DerivaGem can be used to calculate bond prices.)
Bond Yield
A bond’s yield is the single discount rate that, when applied to all cash flows, gives a bond price equal to its market price. Suppose that the theoretical price of the bond we have been considering, $98.39, is also its market value (i.e., the market’s price of the bond is in exact agreement with the data in Table 4.2). If y is the yield on the bond, expressed with continuous compounding, it must be true that
3e-y*0.5+3e-y*1.0+3e-y*1.5+103e-y*2.0=98.39
This equation can be solved using an iterative (“trial and error”) procedure to give 
y=6.76,.3

4.6 BOND PRICING
3 One way of solving nonlinear equations of the form f1y2=0, such as this one, is to use the Newton–Raphson 
method. We start with an estimate y0 of the solution and produce successively better estimates y1, y2, y3,c 
using the formula yi+1=yi-f1yi2>f/uni20321yi2, where f/uni20321y2 denotes the derivative of f  with respect to y .
M04_HULL0654_11_GE_C04.indd   105 12/05/2021   17:18106 CHAPTER 4
Par Yield
The par yield for a certain bond maturity is the coupon rate that causes the bond price to 
equal its par value. (The par value is the same as the principal value.) Usually the bond is  
assumed to provide semiannual coupons. Suppose that the coupon on a 2-year bond in 
our example is c per annum (or 1
2 c per 6 months). Using the zero rates in Table 4.2, the 
value of the bond is equal to its par value of 100 when
c
2e-0.05*0.5+c
2e-0.058*1.0+c
2e-0.064*1.5+a100+c
2be-0.068*2.0=100
This equation can be solved in a straightforward way to give c=6.87. The 2-year par 
yield is therefore 6.87% per annum.
More generally, if d is the present value of $1 received at the maturity of the bond, 
A is the value of an annuity that pays one dollar on each coupon payment date, and m is the number of coupon payments per year, then the par yield c must satisfy
100=Ac
m+100d
so that
c=1100-100d2m
A
In our example, m=2, d=e-0.068*2=0.87284, and
A=e-0.05*0.5+e-0.058*1.0+e-0.064*1.5+e-0.068*2.0=3.70027
The formula confirms that the par yield is 6.87% per annum. A bond with this coupon and semiannual payments is worth par.

In this section we describe a procedure known as the bootstrap method which can be 
used to determine zero rates.
Consider the data in Table 4.3 on the prices of five bonds. Because the first three 
bonds pay no coupons, the zero rates corresponding to the maturities of these bonds 
M04_HULL0654_11_GE_C04.indd   106 12/05/2021   17:18Interest Rates 107
can easily be calculated. The 3-month bond has the effect of turning an investment of 
99.6 into 100 in 3 months. The continuously compounded 3-month rate R is therefore given by solving
100=99.6eR*0.25
It is 1.603% per annum. The 6-month continuously compounded rate is similarly given by solving
100=99.0eR*0.5
It is 2.010% per annum. Similarly, the 1-year rate with continuous compounding is given by solving
100=97.8eR*1.0
It is 2.225% per annum.
The fourth bond lasts 1.5 years. Because coupons are paid semiannually, the cash 
flows it provides are as follows:
6 months: $2
1 year: $2
1.5 years: $102.
From our earlier calculations, we know that the discount rate for the payment at the end of 6 months is 2.010% and that the discount rate for the payment at the end of 1 year is  
2.225%. We also know that the bond’s price, $102.5, must equal the present value of all the payments received by the bondholder. Suppose the 1.5-year zero rate is denoted by R.  
It follows that
2e-0.02010*0.5+2e-0.02225*1.0+102e-R*1.5=102.5
This reduces to
e-1.5R=0.96631
or
R=-ln10.966312
1.5=0.02284
The 1.5-year zero rate is therefore 2.284%. This is the only zero rate that is consistent with the 6-month rate, 1 -year rate, and the data in Table 4.3.
The 2-year zero rate can be calculated similarly from the 6-month, 1-year, and 
1.5-year zero rates, and the information on the last bond in Table 4.3. If R is the  
2-year zero rate, then
2.5e-0.02010*0.5+2.5e-0.02225*1.0+2.5e-0.02284*1.5+102.5e-R*2.0=105
This gives R=0.02416, or 2.416%.
The rates we have calculated are summarized in Table 4.4. A chart showing the zero 
rate as a function of maturity is known as the zero curve. A common assumption is that the zero curve is linear between the points determined using the bootstrap method. (This means that the 1.25-year zero rate is 
0.5*2.225+0.5*2.284=2.255, in our 
example.) It is also usually assumed that the zero curve is horizontal prior to the first point and horizontal beyond the last point. Figure 4.1 shows the zero curve for our data using these assumptions. By using longer maturity bonds, the zero curve would be more accurately determined beyond 2 years.
M04_HULL0654_11_GE_C04.indd   107 12/05/2021   17:18108 CHAPTER 4
In practice, we do not usually have bonds with maturities equal to exactly 1.5 years, 
2 years, 2.5 years, and so on. One approach is to interpolate between the bond price data 
before it is used to calculate the zero curve. For example, if it is known that a 2.3-year bond with a coupon of 6% sells for 108 and a 2.7-year bond with a coupon of 6.5% sells for 109, it might be assumed that a 2.5-year bond with a coupon of 6.25% would sell for 108.5. Another more general procedure is as follows. Define 
t1, t2,c, tn as the maturities  
of the instruments whose prices are to be matched. Assume a piecewise linear curve with  
corners at these times. Use an iterative “trial and error” procedure to determine the rate at time 
t1 that matches the price of the first instrument, then use a similar procedure to 
determine the rate at time t2 that matches the price of the second instrument, and so on.  
For any trial rate, the rates used for coupons are determined by linear interpolation.
A more sophisticated approach is to use polynomial or exponential functions, rather 
than linear functions, for the zero curve between times ti and ti+1 for all i. The functions 
are chosen so that they price the bonds correctly and so that the gradient of the zero curve does not change at any of the 
ti. This is referred to as using a spline function for 
the zero curve.Maturity

5 5.3 6.5Table 4.5  Calculation of forward rates.Forward interest rates are the rates of interest implied by current zero rates for periods 
of time in the future. To illustrate how they are calculated, we suppose that zero rates  
are as shown in the second column of Table 4.5. The rates are assumed to be  
continuously compounded. Thus, the 3% per annum rate for 1 year means that, in  
return for an investment of $100 today, an amount 100e0.03*1=+103.05 is received in  
1 year; the 4% per annum rate for 2 years means that, in return for an investment of $100 today, an amount 
100e0.04*2=+108.33 is received in 2 years; and so on.
The forward interest rate in Table 4.5 for year 2 is 5% per annum. This is the rate of  
interest that is implied by the zero rates for the period of time between the end of the  
first year and the end of the second year. It can be calculated from the 1-year zero  
interest rate of 3% per annum and the 2-year zero interest rate of 4% per annum. It is  
the rate of interest for year 2 that, when combined with 3% per annum for year 1, gives  
4% overall for the 2 years. To show that the correct answer is 5% per annum, suppose that $100 is invested. A rate of 3% for the first year and 5% for the second year gives
100e0.03*1e0.05*1=+108.33
at the end of the second year. A rate of 4% per annum for 2 years gives
100e0.04*2
which is also $108.33. This example illustrates the general result that when interest rates  
are continuously compounded and rates in successive time periods are combined, the  
overall equivalent rate is simply the average rate during the whole period. In our example, 3% for the first year and 5% for the second year average to 4% over  
the 2 years. The result is only approximately true when the rates are not continuously compounded.
The forward rate for year 3 is the rate of interest that is implied by a 4% per annum 
2-year zero rate and a 4.6% per annum 3-year zero rate. It is 5.8% per annum. The reason is that an investment for 2 years at 4% per annum combined with an investment for one year at 5.8% per annum gives an overall average return for the three years of 4.6% per annum. The other forward rates can be calculated similarly and are shown in the third column of the table. In general, if 
R1 and R2 are the zero rates for maturities  4.8 FORWARD RATES
M04_HULL0654_11_GE_C04.indd   109 12/05/2021   17:18110 CHAPTER 4
T1 and T2, respectively, and RF is the forward interest rate for the period of time 
between T1 and T2, then
 RF=R2T2-R1T1
T2-T1 (4.5)
To illustrate this formula, consider the calculation of the year-4 forward rate from the 
data in Table 4.5: T1=3, T2=4, R1=0.046, and R2=0.05, and the formula gives 
RF=0.062.
Equation (4.5) can be written as
 RF=R2+(R2-R1)T1
T2-T1 (4.6)
This shows that, if the zero curve is upward sloping between T1 and T2 so that R27R1, 
then RF7R2 (i.e., the forward rate for a period of time ending at T2 is greater than the  
T2 zero rate). Similarly, if the zero curve is downward sloping with R26R1, then  
RF6R2 (i.e., the forward rate is less than the T2 zero rate). Taking limits as T2  
approaches T1 in equation (4.6) and letting the common value of the two be T  , we obtain
RF=R+T0R
0T
where R is the zero rate for a maturity of T. The value of RF obtained in this way is 
known as the instantaneous forward rate for a maturity of T. This is the forward rate that is applicable to a very short future time period that begins at time T. Define 
P10, T2 
as the price of a zero-coupon bond maturing at time T. Because P10, T2=e-RT, the 
equation for the instantaneous forward rate can also be written as
RF=-0
0T ln P10, T2
If a large financial institution can borrow or lend at the rates in Table 4.5, it can lock in 
the forward rates. For example, it can borrow $100 at 3% for 1 year and invest the money at 4% for 2 years, the result is a cash outflow of 
100e0.03*1=+103.05 at the end of year 1 
and an inflow of 100e0.04*2=+108.33 at the end of year 2. Since 108.33=103.05e0.05, a  
return equal to the forward rate (5%) is earned on $103.05 during the second year. Alternatively, it can borrow $100 for 4 years at 5% and invest it for 3 years at 4.6%. The result is a cash inflow of 
100e0.046*3=+114.80 at the end of the third year and a cash  
outflow of 100e0.05*4=+122.14 at the end of the fourth year. Since 122.14=114.80e0.062, 
money is being borrowed for the fourth year at the forward rate of 6.2%.
If a large investor thinks that rates in the future will be different from today’s forward 
rates, there are many trading strategies that the investor will find attractive (see Business Snapshot 4.1). One of these involves entering into a contract known as a forward rate 
agreement. We will now discuss how this contract works and how it is valued.
4.9 FORWARD RATE AGREEMENTS
A forward rate agreement (FRA) is an agreement to exchange a predetermined fixed rate for a reference rate that will be observed in the market at a future time. Both rates

4 In practice, because LIBOR is determined in advance of a period, the payment would be made at time two  
years and equal to the present value of $125,000 discounted for three months at 3.5%.Business Snapshot 4.1  Orange County’s Yield Curve Plays
Suppose a large investor can borrow or lend at the rates given in Table 4.5 and thinks 
that 1 -year interest rates will not change much over the next 5 years. The investor can  
borrow 1 -year funds and invest for 5-years. The 1 -year borrowings can be rolled over for further 1 -year periods at the end of the first, second, third, and fourth years. If interest rates do stay about the same, this strategy will yield a profit of about 2.3% per year, because interest will be received at 5.3% and paid at 3%. This type of  
trading strategy is known as a yield curve play. The investor is speculating that rates in  
the future will be quite different from the forward rates observed in the market today.  
(In our example, forward rates observed in the market today for future 1 -year periods are 5%, 5.8%, 6.2%, and 6.5%.)
Robert Citron, the Treasurer at Orange County, used yield curve plays similar to 
the one we have just described very successfully in 1992 and 1993. The profit from Mr. Citron’s trades became an important contributor to Orange County’s budget and he was re-elected. (No one listened to his opponent in the election, who said his trading strategy was too risky.)
In 1994 Mr. Citron expanded his yield curve plays. He invested heavily in inverse 
floaters. These pay a rate of interest equal to a fixed rate of interest minus a floating rate. He also leveraged his position by borrowing in the repo market. If short-term interest rates had remained the same or declined he would have continued to do well.  
As it happened, interest rates rose sharply during 1994. On December 1, 1994, Orange County announced that its investment portfolio had lost $1.5 billion and several days later it filed for bankruptcy protection.
are applied to a specified principal, but the principal itself is not exchanged. Historic-ally, the reference rate has usually been LIBOR. Consider an agreement to exchange 3% for three-month LIBOR in two years with both rates being applied to a principal of $100 million. One side (Party A) would agree to pay LIBOR and receive the fixed rate of 3%. The other side (Party B) would agree to receive LIBOR and pay the fixed rate of  
3%. Assume all rates are compounded quarterly (as would usually be the case). If  three-month LIBOR proved to be 3.5% in two years, Party A would receive
+100,000,000*10.035-0.0302*0.25=+125,000
and Party B would pay this amount. The payment would be due at time 2.25 years.4
As LIBOR is phased out, we can expect to see more FRAs based on floating rates 
such as three-month SOFR and three-month SONIA. FRAs are a way of locking in the  
rate that will be paid or received in the future. For example, a trader who is due to 
receive a rate based on three-month SOFR on a certain principal during a certain future time period can lock in the rate by entering into an FRA where SOFR is paid and a fixed rate is received. Similarly, a trader who is due to pay a rate based on three-month SOFR on a certain principal during a certain future time period can lock in the rate by entering into an FRA where SOFR is received and a fixed rate is paid.
M04_HULL0654_11_GE_C04.indd   111 12/05/2021   17:18112 CHAPTER 4
When the fixed rate equals the relevant forward rate the value of an FRA is zero. For 
example, when the reference rate is three-month SOFR, an FRA would be worth zero 
when the fixed rate equals the forward three-month SOFR rate.5 When an FRA is first set  
up the fixed rate is normally equal to the forward rate, so that its value is zero. As time passes, the forward rate is liable to change. Suppose that, at a particular time, we define:
RK: the fixed rate agreed to in the FRA
RF: the current forward rate for the reference rate
t: the period of time to which the rates apply (three months in the above example)
L: the principal in the contract.
We can compare
1. the FRA under consideration
2. a similar FRA where the fixed rate is the forward rate, RF.
For the party receiving the fixed rate, the only difference between the two FRAs is that  
the cash flow at maturity for the first FRA is t1RK-RF2L more than that for the  
second FRA. (This amount can be positive or negative.) We know that the second FRA is worth zero. It follows that the first FRA is worth the present value of 
t1RK-RF2L. 
Similarly, for the party that pays the fixed rate, the FRA is worth the present value of 
t1RF-RK2L.
An important implication of these results is that an FRA can be valued by assuming 
that the forward interest rate for the underlying reference rate will be the one that determines the exchange.
Example 4.3
Suppose that the forward SOFR rate for the period between time 1.5 years and  
time 2 years in the future is 5% (with semiannual compounding) and that some 
time ago a company entered into an FRA where it will receive 5.8% (with semi- annual compounding) and pay SOFR on a principal of $100 million for the period. The 2-year (SOFR) risk-free rate is 4% (with continuous compounding). The value of the FRA is
100,000,000*10.058-0.0502*0.5e-0.04*2=+369,200
5 Chapters 5 and 7 provide more on the determination of forward rates.4.10 DURATION
The duration of a bond, as its name implies, is a measure of how long the holder of the  
bond has to wait before receiving the present value of the cash payments. A zero- coupon bond that lasts n years has a duration of n years. However, a coupon-bearing bond lasting n  years has a duration of less than n  years, because the holder receives  
some of the cash payments prior to year n.
Suppose that a bond provides the holder with cash flows 
ci at time ti 11…i…n2. The 
bond price B and bond yield y (continuously compounded) are related by
 B=an
i=1cie-yti (4.7)
M04_HULL0654_11_GE_C04.indd   112 12/05/2021   17:18Interest Rates 113
The duration of the bond, D, is defined as
 D=an
i=1 ticie-yti
B (4.8)
This can be written
D=an
i=1ticcie-yti
Bd
The term in square brackets is the ratio of the present value of the cash flow at time ti to  
the bond price. The bond price is the present value of all payments. The duration is  
therefore a weighted average of the times when payments are made, with the weight 
applied to time ti being equal to the proportion of the bond’s total present value  
provided by the cash flow at time ti. The sum of the weights is 1.0. Note that, for the 
purposes of the definition of duration, all discounting is done at the bond yield rate of interest, y. (We do not use a different zero rate for each cash flow in the way described in  
Section 4.6.)
When a small change 
∆y in the yield is considered, it is approximately true that
 ∆B=dB
dy∆y (4.9)
From equation (4.7), this becomes
 ∆B=-∆yan
i=1citie-yti (4.10)
(Note that there is a negative relationship between B and y. When bond yields increase, 
bond prices decrease. When bond yields decrease, bond prices increase.) From equa-tions (4.8) and (4.10), the key duration relationship is obtained:
 
∆B=-BD ∆y (4.11)
This can be written
 ∆B
B=-D ∆y (4.12)
Equation (4.12) is an approximate relationship between percentage changes in a bond 
price and changes in its yield. It is easy to use and is the reason why duration, first suggested by Frederick Macaulay in 1938, has become such a popular measure.
Consider a 3-year 10% coupon bond with a face value of $100. Suppose that the yield  
on the bond is 12% per annum with continuous compounding. This means that  
y=0.12. Coupon payments of $5 are made every 6 months. Table 4.6 shows the 
calculations necessary to determine the bond’s duration. The present values of the bond’s cash flows, using the yield as the discount rate, are shown in column 3 (e.g., the present value of the first cash flow is 
5e-0.12*0.5=4.709). The sum of the numbers in 
column 3 gives the bond’s price as 94.213. The weights are calculated by dividing the numbers in column 3 by 94.213. The sum of the numbers in column 5 gives the duration as 2.653 years.
DV01 is the price change from a 1 -basis-point increase in all rates. Gamma is the 
change in DV01 from a 1 -basis-point increase in all rates. The following example investigates the accuracy of the duration relationship in equation (4.11).
M04_HULL0654_11_GE_C04.indd   113 12/05/2021   17:18114 CHAPTER 4
Example 4.4
For the bond in Table 4.6, the bond price, B , is 94.213 and the duration, D , is 
2.653, so that equation (4.11) gives
∆B=-94.213*2.653*∆y
or
∆B=-249.95*∆y
When the yield on the bond increases by 10 basis points 1=0.1,2, ∆y=+0.001. 
The duration relationship predicts that ∆B=-249.95*0.001=-0.250, so that  
the bond price goes down to 94.213-0.250=93.963. How accurate is this? 
Valuing the bond in terms of its yield in the usual way, we find that, when the 
bond yield increases by 10 basis points to 12.1%, the bond price is
5e-0.121*0.5+5e-0.121*1.0+5e-0.121*1.5+5e-0.121*2.0
+ 5e-0.121*2.5+105e-0.121*3.0=93.963
which is (to three decimal places) the same as that predicted by the duration relationship.
Modified Duration
The preceding analysis is based on the assumption that y is expressed with continuous compounding. If y is expressed with annual compounding, it can be shown that the approximate relationship in equation (4.11) becomes
∆B=-

More generally, if y is expressed with a compounding frequency of m times per year, then

is sometimes referred to as the bond’s modified duration. It allows the duration relation-
ship to be simplified to
 ∆B=-BD*∆y (4.13)
when y is expressed with a compounding frequency of m times per year. The following 
example investigates the accuracy of the modified duration relationship.
Example 4.5
The bond in Table 4.6 has a price of 94.213 and a duration of 2.653. The yield, 
expressed with semiannual compounding is 12.3673%. The modified duration, D*, 
is given by
D*=2.653
1+0.123673>2=2.499
From equation (4.13),
∆B=-94.213*2.499*∆y
or
∆B=-235.39*∆y
When the yield (semiannually compounded) increases by 10 basis points 1=0.1,2, 
we have ∆y=+0.001. The duration relationship predicts that we expect ∆B to be  
-235.39*0.001=-0.235, so that the bond price goes down to 94.213-0.235 =
93.978. How accurate is this? An exact calculation similar to that in the previous 
example shows that, when the bond yield (semiannually compounded) increases by  
10 basis points to 12.4673%, the bond price becomes 93.978. This shows that the modified duration calculation gives good accuracy for small yield changes.
Another term that is sometimes used is dollar duration. This is the product of modified duration and bond price, so that 
∆B=-D+∆y, where D+ is dollar duration.
Bond Portfolios
The duration, D, of a bond portfolio can be defined as a weighted average of the durations of the individual bonds in the portfolio, with the weights being proportional to the bond prices. Equations (4.11) to (4.13) then apply, with B being defined as the value of the bond portfolio. They estimate the change in the value of the bond portfolio for a small change 
∆y in the yields of all the bonds.
It is important to realize that, when duration is used for bond portfolios, there is an  
implicit assumption that the yields of all bonds will change by approximately the same amount. When the bonds have widely differing maturities, this happens only when there  
is a parallel shift in the zero-coupon yield curve. We should therefore interpret  
equations (4.11) to (4.13) as providing estimates of the impact on the price of a bond portfolio of a small parallel shift, 
∆y, in the zero curve.
By choosing a portfolio so that the duration of assets equals the duration of liabilities 
(i.e., the net duration is zero), a financial institution eliminates its exposure to small parallel shifts in the yield curve. But it is still exposed to shifts that are either large or nonparallel.
M04_HULL0654_11_GE_C04.indd   115 12/05/2021   17:18116 CHAPTER 4
The duration relationship applies only to small changes in yields. This is illustrated in 
 Figure 4.2, which shows the relationship between the percentage change in value and 
change in yield for two bond portfolios having the same duration. The gradients of  
the two curves are the same at the origin. This means that both bond portfolios change in value by the same percentage for small yield changes and is consistent with equation (4.12). For large yield changes, the portfolios behave differently. Portfolio X  
has more curvature in its relationship with yields than portfolio Y . A factor known as  
convexity measures this curvature and can be used to improve the relationship in  
equation (4.12).
A measure of convexity is

Maturity (years) Deposit rate Mortgage rate
1 3% 6%
5 3% 6%Table 4.7 Example of rates offered by a bank to its customers.It is natural to ask what determines the shape of the zero curve. Why is it sometimes 
downward sloping, sometimes upward sloping, and sometimes partly upward sloping and partly downward sloping? A number of different theories have been proposed. The simplest is expectations theory, which conjectures that long-term interest rates should 
reflect expected future short-term interest rates. More precisely, it argues that a forward interest rate corresponding to a certain future period is equal to the expected future zero  
interest rate for that period. Another idea, market segmentation theory, conjectures that  
there need be no relationship between short-, medium-, and long-term interest rates. Under the theory, a major investor such as a large pension fund or an insurance  
company invests in bonds of a certain maturity and does not readily switch from one maturity to another. The short-term interest rate is determined by supply and demand in the short-term bond market; the medium-term interest rate is determined by supply and demand in the medium-term bond market; and so on.
The theory that is most appealing is liquidity preference theory. The basic assumption 
underlying the theory is that investors prefer to preserve their liquidity and invest funds for short periods of time. Borrowers, on the other hand, usually prefer to borrow at fixed rates for long periods of time. This leads to a situation in which forward rates are greater than expected future zero rates. The theory is also consistent with the empirical result that yield curves tend to be upward sloping more often than they are downward sloping.
The Management of Net Interest Income
To understand liquidity preference theory, it is useful to consider the interest rate risk faced by banks when they take deposits and make loans. The net interest income of the bank is the excess of the interest received over the interest paid and needs to be carefully  
managed.
Consider a simple situation where a bank offers consumers a one-year and a five-year  
deposit rate as well as a one-year and five-year mortgage rate. The rates are shown in  
Table 4.7. We make the simplifying assumption that the expected one-year interest rate  
for future time periods is equal the one-year rates prevailing in the market today. Loosely speaking this means that the market considers interest rate increases to be just as likely as interest rate decreases. As a result, the rates in Table 4.7 are “fair” in that least when the payments are concentrated around one particular point in time. By 
choosing a portfolio of assets and liabilities with a net duration of zero and a net convexity of zero, a financial institution can make itself immune to relatively large parallel shifts in the zero curve. However, it is still exposed to nonparallel shifts.
4.12 THEORIES OF THE TERM STRUCTURE OF INTEREST RATES
M04_HULL0654_11_GE_C04.indd   117 12/05/2021   17:18118 CHAPTER 4
they reflect the market’s expectations (i.e., they correspond to expectations theory). 
Investing money for one year and reinvesting for four further one-year periods give the  
same expected overall return as a single five-year investment. Similarly, borrowing money for one year and refinancing each year for the next four years leads to the same expected financing costs as a single five-year loan.
Suppose you have money to deposit and agree with the prevailing view that interest 
rate increases are just as likely as interest rate decreases. Would you choose to deposit your money for one year at 3% per annum or for five years at 3% per annum? The chances are that you would choose one year because this gives you more financial  
flexibility. It ties up your funds for a shorter period of time.
Now suppose that you want a mortgage. Again you agree with the prevailing view 
that interest rate increases are just as likely as interest rate decreases. Would you choose a one-year mortgage at 6% or a five-year mortgage at 6%? The chances are that you would choose a five-year mortgage because it fixes your borrowing rate for the next five years and subjects you to less refinancing risk.
When the bank posts the rates shown in Table 4.7, it is likely to find that the majority 
of its depositors opt for one-year deposits and the majority of its borrowers opt for five- year mortgages. This creates an asset/liability mismatch for the bank and subjects it to risks. There is no problem if interest rates fall. The bank will find itself financing the five-year 6% loans with deposits that cost less than 3% in the future and net interest income will increase. However, if rates rise, the deposits that are financing these 6% loans will cost more than 3% in the future and net interest income will decline. A 3% rise in interest rates would reduce the net interest income to zero.
It is the job of the asset/liability management group to ensure that the maturities of  
the assets on which interest is earned and the maturities of the liabilities on which interest is paid are matched. One way it can do this is by increasing the five-year rate on  
both deposits and mortgages. For example, it could move to the situation in Table 4.8 where the five-year deposit rate is 4% and the five-year mortgage rate 7%. This would make five-year deposits relatively more attractive and one-year mortgages relatively more attractive. Some customers who chose one-year deposits when the rates were as in  
Table 4.7 will switch to five-year deposits in the Table 4.8 situation. Some customers 
who chose five-year mortgages when the rates were as in Table 4.7 will choose one-year mortgages. This may lead to the maturities of assets and liabilities being matched. If there is still an imbalance with depositors tending to choose a one-year maturity and borrowers a five-year maturity, five-year deposit and mortgage rates could be increased even further. Eventually the imbalance will disappear.
The net result of all banks behaving in the way we have just described is liquidity  
preference theory. Long-term rates tend to be higher than those that would be  predicted by expected future short-term rates. The yield curve is upward sloping most Maturity (years) Deposit rate Mortgage rate

Business Snapshot 4.2 Liquidity and the 2007–2009 Financial Crisis
During the financial crisis that started in July 2007 there was a “flight to quality, ” 
where financial institutions and investors looked for safe investments and were less inclined than before to take credit risks. Financial institutions that relied on short-term funding experienced liquidity problems. One example is Northern Rock in the United Kingdom, which financed much of its mortgage portfolio with wholesale deposits, some lasting only 3 months. Starting in September 2007 , the depositors became nervous and refused to roll over the funding they were providing to Northern Rock, i.e., at the end of a 3-month period they would refuse to deposit their funds for  
a further 3-month period. As a result, Northern Rock was unable to finance its assets.  
It was taken over by the U.K. government in early 2008. In the United States,  
financial institutions such as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers experienced similar liquidity problems because they had chosen to fund part of their operations with short-term funds.
of the time. It is downward sloping only when the market expects a steep decline in short-term rates.
Many banks now have sophisticated systems for monitoring the decisions being made  
by customers so that, when they detect small differences between the maturities of the assets and liabilities being chosen by customers they can fine tune the rates they offer.  
Sometimes derivatives such as interest rate swaps are also used to manage their  
exposure. The result of all this is that net interest income is usually very stable. This  
has not always been the case. In the United States, the failure of Savings and Loan companies in the 1980s and the failure of Continental Illinois in 1984 were to a large extent a result of the fact that they did not match the maturities of assets and liabilities. Both failures proved to be very expensive for U.S. taxpayers.
Liquidity
In addition to creating problems in the way that has been described, a portfolio where maturities are mismatched can lead to liquidity problems. Consider a financial institu-tion that funds 5-year fixed rate loans with wholesale deposits that last only 3 months. It might recognize its exposure to rising interest rates and hedge its interest rate risk. (One way of doing this is by using interest rate swaps, as mentioned earlier.) However, it  
still has a liquidity risk. Wholesale depositors may, for some reason, lose confidence in the financial institution and refuse to continue to provide the financial institution with short-term funding. The financial institution, even if it has adequate equity capital, will then experience a severe liquidity problem that could lead to its downfall. As described in Business Snapshot 4.2, these types of liquidity problems were the root cause of some of the failures of financial institutions during the crisis that started in 2007 .
SUMMARY
The compounding frequency used for an interest rate defines the units in which it is  
measured. The difference between an annually compounded rate and a quarterly  
compounded rate is analogous to the difference between a distance measured in miles  
M04_HULL0654_11_GE_C04.indd   119 12/05/2021   17:18120 CHAPTER 4
and a distance measured in kilometers. Traders frequently use continuous compound-
ing when analyzing the value of options and more complex derivatives.
Many different types of interest rates are quoted in financial markets and calculated by  
analysts. The n-year zero or spot rate is the rate applicable to an investment lasting for 
n years when all of the return is realized at the end. The par yield on a bond of a certain maturity is the coupon rate that causes the bond to sell for its par value. Forward rates are  
the rates applicable to future periods of time implied by today’s zero rates.
The method most commonly used to calculate zero rates is known as the bootstrap 
method. It involves starting with short-term instruments and moving progressively to longer-term instruments, making sure that the zero rates calculated at each stage are  
consistent with the prices of the instruments. It is used daily by trading desks to  
calculate a variety of zero curves.
A forward rate agreement (FRA) is an over-the-counter agreement where a floating 
rate will be exchanged for a specified interest rate with both rates being applied to a predetermined principal over a predetermined period.
An important concept in interest rate markets is duration. Duration measures the 
sensitivity of the value of a bond portfolio to a small parallel shift in the zero-coupon yield curve. Specifically,
∆B=-BD ∆y
where B is the value of the bond portfolio, D is the duration of the portfolio, ∆y is the 
size of a small parallel shift in the zero curve, and ∆B is the resultant effect on the value 
of the bond portfolio.
Liquidity preference theory can be used to explain the interest rate term structures 
that are observed in practice. The theory argues that most entities like to borrow long and lend short. To match the maturities of borrowers and lenders, it is necessary for financial institutions to raise long-term rates so that forward interest rates are higher than expected future spot interest rates.

In this chapter we examine how forward prices and futures prices are related to the spot 
price of the underlying asset. Forward contracts are easier to analyze than futures contracts because there is no daily settlement—only a single payment at maturity. We therefore start this chapter by considering the relationship between the forward price and the spot price. Luckily it can be shown that the forward price and futures price of an asset are usually very close when the maturities of the two contracts are the same. This is convenient because it means that results obtained for forwards can be assumed to be true for futures.
In the first part of the chapter we derive some important general results on the 
relationship between forward (or futures) prices and spot prices. We then use the results to examine the relationship between futures prices and spot prices for contracts on stock indices, foreign exchange, and commodities. We will consider interest rate futures contracts in the next chapter.Determination of  
Forward and 
Futures Prices5 CHAPTER  
When considering forward and futures contracts, it is important to distinguish between investment assets and consumption assets. An investment asset is an asset that is held solely for investment purposes by at least some traders. Stocks and bonds are clearly investment assets. Gold and silver are also examples of investment assets. Note that investment assets do not have to be held exclusively for investment. (Silver, for  
example, has a number of industrial uses.) However, they do have to satisfy the requirement that they are held by some traders solely for investment. A consumption asset is an asset that is held primarily for consumption. It is not normally held for investment. Examples of consumption assets are commodities such as copper, crude oil, corn, and pork bellies.
As we shall see later in this chapter, we can use arbitrage arguments to determine the 
forward and futures prices of an investment asset from its spot price and other  
observable market variables. We cannot do this for consumption assets.5.1 INVESTMENT ASSETS vs. CONSUMPTION ASSETS
M05_HULL0654_11_GE_C05.indd   124 30/04/2021   16:46Determination of Forward and Futures Prices 125
Some of the arbitrage strategies presented in this chapter involve short selling. This 
trade, usually simply referred to as “shorting” , involves selling an asset that is not owned. It is something that is possible for some—but not all—investment assets. We will illustrate how it works by considering a short sale of shares of a stock.
Suppose an investor instructs a broker to short 500 shares of company X. The broker 
will carry out the instructions by borrowing the shares from someone who owns them and selling them in the market in the usual way. At some later stage, the investor will close out the position by purchasing 500 shares of company X in the market. These shares are then used to replace the borrowed shares so that the short position is closed out. The investor takes a profit if the stock price has declined and a loss if it has risen. If at any time while the contract is open the broker has to return the borrowed shares and there are no other shares that can be borrowed, the investor is forced to close out the position, even if not ready to do so. Often a fee is charged for lending the shares to the party doing the shorting.
An investor with a short position must pay to the broker any income, such as  
dividends or interest, that would normally be received on the securities that have been shorted. The broker will transfer this income to the account of the client from whom the securities have been borrowed. Consider the position of an investor who shorts 500 shares in April when the price per share is $120 and closes out the position by buying them back in July when the price per share is $100. Suppose that a dividend of $1 per share is paid in May. The investor receives 
500*+120=+60,000 in April when 
the short position is initiated. The dividend leads to a payment by the investor of 
500*+1=+500 in May. The investor also pays 500*+100=+50,000 for shares when 
the position is closed out in July. The net gain, therefore, is
+60,000-+500-+50,000=+9,500
when any fee for borrowing the shares is ignored. Table 5.1 illustrates this example and shows that the cash flows from the short sale are the mirror image of the cash flows from purchasing the shares in April and selling them in July. (Again, the fee for  
borrowing the shares is not considered.)5.2 SHORT SELLING

Net profit=++9,500
M05_HULL0654_11_GE_C05.indd   125 30/04/2021   16:46126 CHAPTER 5
The investor is required to maintain a margin account with the broker. The margin 
account consists of cash or marketable securities deposited by the investor with the 
broker to guarantee that the investor will not walk away from the short position if the share price increases. It is similar to the margin account discussed in Chapter 2 for futures contracts. An initial margin is required and if there are adverse movements (i.e., increases) in the price of the asset that is being shorted, additional margin may be required. If the additional margin is not provided, the short position is closed out. The margin account does not represent a cost to the investor. This is because interest is usually paid on the balance in margin accounts and, if the interest rate offered is  
unacceptable, marketable securities such as Treasury bills can be used to meet margin requirements. The proceeds of the sale of the asset belong to the investor and normally form part of the initial margin.
From time to time regulations are changed on short selling. In 1938, the uptick rule 
was introduced. This allowed shares to be shorted only on an “uptick”—that is, when the most recent movement in the share price was an increase. The SEC abolished the uptick rule in July 2007, but introduced an “alternative uptick” rule in February 2010. Under this rule, when the price of a stock has decreased by more than 10% in one day, there are restrictions on short selling for that day and the next. These restrictions are that the stock can be shorted only at a price that is higher than the best current bid  
price. Occasionally there are temporary bans on short selling. This happened in a  
number of countries in 2008 because it was considered that short selling contributed to the high market volatility that was being experienced.
In this chapter we will assume that the following are all true for some market  
participants:
1. The market participants are subject to no transaction costs when they trade.
2. The market participants are subject to the same tax rate on all net trading profits.
3. The market participants can borrow money at the same risk-free rate of interest as 
they can lend money.
4. The market participants take advantage of arbitrage opportunities as they occur.
Note that we do not require these assumptions to be true for all market participants. All 
that we require is that they be true—or at least approximately true—for a few key market participants such as large derivatives dealers. It is the trading activities of these key market participants and their eagerness to take advantage of arbitrage opportun-ities as they occur that determine the relationship between forward and spot prices.
The following notation will be used throughout this chapter:
 
T: Time until delivery date in a forward or futures contract (in years)
 S0: Price of the asset underlying the forward or futures contract today
 F0: Forward or futures price today
 r: Zero-coupon risk-free rate of interest per annum, expressed with continuous compounding, for an investment maturing at the delivery date (i.e., in T years).5.3 ASSUMPTIONS AND NOTATION
M05_HULL0654_11_GE_C05.indd   126 30/04/2021   16:46Determination of Forward and Futures Prices 127
The risk-free rate, r , is the interest rate at which money is borrowed or lent when there is 
no credit risk, so that the borrowed money is certain to be repaid. As discussed in  
Chapter 4, participants in derivatives markets use overnight rates and rates derived 
from overnight rates as risk-free rates.
1 Forward contracts on individual stocks do not often arise in practice. However, they form useful examples 
for developing our ideas. Futures on individual stocks started trading in the United States in November 2002.The easiest forward contract to value is one written on an investment asset that  
provides the holder with no income and for which there are no storage costs. Non-  
dividend-paying stocks and zero-coupon bonds are examples of such investment assets.
Consider a long forward contract to purchase a non-dividend-paying stock in  
3 months.
1 Assume the current stock price is $40 and the 3-month risk-free interest  
rate is 5% per annum.
Suppose first that the forward price is relatively high at $43. An arbitrageur can borrow 
$40 at the risk-free interest rate of 5% per annum, buy one share, and short a forward contract to sell one share in 3 months. At the end of the 3 months, the arbitrageur delivers the share and receives $43. The sum of money required to pay off the loan is
40e0.05*3>12=+40.50
By following this strategy, the arbitrageur locks in a profit of +43.00-+40.50=+2.50 
at the end of the 3-month period.
Suppose next that the forward price is relatively low at $39. An arbitrageur can 
short one share, invest the proceeds of the short sale at 5% per annum for 3 months, and take a long position in a 3-month forward contract. The proceeds of the short  
sale grow to 
40e0.05*3>12 or $40.50 in 3 months. At the end of the 3 months, the  
arbitrageur pays $39, takes delivery of the share under the terms of the forward  
contract, and uses it to close out the short position. A net gain of
+40.50-+39.00=+1.50
is therefore made at the end of the 3 months. The two trading strategies we have  
considered are summarized in Table 5.2.
Under what circumstances do arbitrage opportunities such as those in Table 5.2 not 
exist? The first arbitrage works when the forward price is greater than $40.50. The  
second arbitrage works when the forward price is less than $40.50. We deduce that for there to be no arbitrage the forward price must be exactly $40.50.
A Generalization
To generalize this example, we consider a forward contract on an investment asset with price 
S0 that provides no income. Using our notation, T is the time to maturity, r is the 
risk-free rate, and F0 is the forward price. The relationship between F0 and S0 is
 F0=S0erT (5. 1)5.4 FORWARD PRICE FOR AN INVESTMENT ASSET

If F07S0erT, arbitrageurs can buy the asset and short forward contracts on the asset. If 
F06S0erT, they can short the asset and enter into long forward contracts on it.2 In our 
example, S0=40, r=0.05, and T=0.25, so that equation (5.1) gives
F0=40e0.05*0.25=+40.50
which is in agreement with our earlier calculations.
A long forward contract and a spot purchase both lead to the asset being owned at 
time T. The forward price is higher than the spot price because of the cost of  
financing the spot purchase of the asset during the life of the forward contract. This 
point was overlooked by Kidder Peabody in 1994, much to its cost (see Business  
Snapshot 5.1).
Example 5.1
Consider a 4-month forward contract to buy a zero-coupon bond that will mature 
1 year from today. (This means that the bond will have 8 months to go when the forward contract matures.) The current price of the bond is $930. We assume that the 4-month risk-free rate of interest (continuously compounded) is 6% per an -num. Because zero-coupon bonds provide no income, we can use equation (5.1) with 
T=4>12, r=0.06, and S0=930. The forward price, F0, is given by
F0=930e0.06*4>12=+948.79
This would be the delivery price in a contract negotiated today.
2 For another way of seeing that equation (5.1) is correct, consider the following strategy: buy one unit of the 
asset and enter into a short forward contract to sell it for F0 at time T . This costs S0 and is certain to lead to a 
cash inflow of F0 at time T. Therefore S0 must equal the present value of F0; that is, S0=F0e-rT, or  
equivalently F0=S0erT.
M05_HULL0654_11_GE_C05.indd   128 30/04/2021   16:46Determination of Forward and Futures Prices 129
What If Short Sales Are Not Possible?
Short sales are not possible for all investment assets and sometimes a fee is charged for 
borrowing assets. As it happens, this does not matter. To derive equation (5.1), we do not need to be able to short the asset. All that we require is that there be market  
participants who hold the asset purely for investment (and by definition this is always true of an investment asset). If the forward price is too low, they will find it attractive to sell the asset and take a long position in a forward contract.
We continue to consider the case where the underlying investment asset gives rise to 
no storage costs or income. If 
F07S0erT, an investor can adopt the following strategy:
1. Borrow S0 dollars at an interest rate r for T years.
2. Buy 1 unit of the asset.
3. Enter into a forward contract to sell 1 unit of the asset.
At time T, the asset is sold for F0. An amount S0erT is required to repay the loan at this 
time and the investor makes a profit of F0-S0erT.
Suppose next that F06S0erT. In this case, an investor who owns the asset can:
1. Sell the asset for S0.
2. Invest the proceeds at interest rate r for time T.
3. Enter into a forward contract to buy 1 unit of the asset.
At time T, the cash invested has grown to S0erT. The asset is repurchased for F0 and the 
investor makes a profit of S0erT-F0 relative to the position the investor would have 
been in if the asset had been kept.
As in the non-dividend-paying stock example considered earlier, we can expect the 
forward price to adjust so that neither of the two arbitrage opportunities we have  
considered exists. This means that the relationship in equation (5.1) must hold.Business Snapshot 5.1 Kidder Peabody’s Embarrassing Mistake
Investment banks have developed a way of creating a zero-coupon bond, called a strip, from a coupon-bearing Treasury bond by selling each of the cash flows under -
lying the coupon-bearing bond as a separate security. Joseph Jett, a trader working for Kidder Peabody, had a relatively simple trading strategy. He would buy strips and sell them in the forward market. As equation (5.1) shows, the forward price of a security providing no income is always higher than the spot price. Suppose, for example, that the 3-month interest rate is 4% per annum and the spot price of a strip is $70. The 3-month forward price of the strip is 
70e0.04*3>12=+70.70.
Kidder Peabody’s computer system reported a profit on each of Jett’s trades equal to 
the excess of the forward price over the spot price ($0.70 in our example). In fact, this profit was nothing more than the cost of financing the purchase of the strip. But, by rolling his contracts forward, Jett was able to prevent this cost from accruing to him.
The result was that the system reported a profit of $100 million on Jett’s trading 
(and Jett received a big bonus) when in fact there was a loss in the region of  
$350 million. This shows that even large financial institutions can get relatively  
simple things wrong!
M05_HULL0654_11_GE_C05.indd   129 30/04/2021   16:46130 CHAPTER 5
In this section we consider a forward contract on an investment asset that will provide a 
perfectly predictable cash income to the holder. Examples are stocks paying known dividends and coupon-bearing bonds. We adopt the same approach as in the previous section. We first look at a numerical example and then review the formal arguments.
Consider a forward contract to purchase a coupon-bearing bond whose current price 
is $900. We will suppose that the forward contract matures in 9 months. We will also suppose that a coupon payment of $40 is expected on the bond after 4 months. We assume that the 4-month and 9-month risk-free interest rates (continuously com-pounded) are, respectively, 3% and 4% per annum.
Suppose first that the forward price is relatively high at $910. An arbitrageur can 
borrow $900 to buy the bond and enter into the forward contract to sell the bond for $910. The coupon payment has a present value of 
40e-0.03*4>12=+39.60. Of the $900, 
$39.60 is therefore borrowed at 3% per annum for 4 months so that it can be repaid  
with the coupon payment. The remaining $860.40 is borrowed at 4% per annum for  
9 months. The amount owing at the end of the 9-month period is 860.40e0.04*0.75 = 
+886.60. A sum of $910 is received for the bond under the terms of the forward  
contract. The arbitrageur therefore makes a net profit of
910.00-886.60=+23.40
Suppose next that the forward price is relatively low at $870. An investor can short the bond and enter into the forward contract to buy the bond for $870. Of the $900 realized from shorting the bond, $39.60 is invested for 4 months at 3% per annum so that it grows into an amount sufficient to pay the coupon on the bond. The remaining $860.40 is invested for 9 months at 4% per annum and grows to $886.60. Under the terms of the forward contract, $870 is paid to buy the bond and the short position is closed out. The investor therefore gains
886.60-870=+16.60
The two strategies we have considered are summarized in Table 5.3.3 The first strategy 
in Table 5.3 produces a profit when the forward price is greater than $886.60, whereas 
the second strategy produces a profit when the forward price is less than $886.60. It follows that if there are no arbitrage opportunities then the forward price must be $886.60.
A Generalization
We can generalize from this example to argue that, when an investment asset will  
provide income with a present value of I during the life of a forward contract, we have
 F0=1S0-I2erT (5. 2)5.5 KNOWN INCOME
3 If shorting the bond is not possible, investors who already own the bond will sell it and buy a forward  
contract on the bond increasing the value of their position by $16.60. This is similar to the strategy we 
described for the asset in the previous section.
M05_HULL0654_11_GE_C05.indd   130 30/04/2021   16:46Determination of Forward and Futures Prices 131
In our example, S0=900.00, I=40e-0.03*4>12=39.60, r=0.04, and T=0.75, so that
F0=1900.00-39.602e0.04*0.75=+886.60
This is in agreement with our earlier calculation. Equation (5.2) applies to any investment 
asset that provides a known cash income.
If F071S0-I2erT, an arbitrageur can lock in a profit by buying the asset and 
 shorting a forward contract on the asset; if F061S0-I2erT, an arbitrageur can lock  
in a profit by shorting the asset and taking a long position in a forward contract. If  
short sales are not possible, investors who own the asset will find it profitable to sell the 
asset and enter into long forward contracts.4
Example 5.2
Consider a 10-month forward contract on a stock when the stock price is $50. We assume that the risk-free rate of interest (continuously compounded) is 8% per annum for all maturities and also that dividends of $0.75 per share are expected after 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months. The present value of the dividends, I, is
I=0.75e-0.08*3>12+0.75e-0.08*6>12+0.75e-0.08*9>12=2.162
The variable T is 10 months, so that the forward price, F0, from equation (5.2), is Table 5.3 Arbitrage opportunities when 9-month forward price is out of line with 
spot price for asset providing known cash income. (Asset price=+900; income of 
$40 occurs at 4 months; 4-month and 9-month rates are, respectively, 3% and 4%  per annum.)

4 For another way of seeing that equation (5.2) is correct, consider the following strategy: buy one unit of the 
asset and enter into a short forward contract to sell it for F0 at time T . This costs S0 and is certain to lead to a 
cash inflow of F0 at time T and an income with a present value of I. The initial outflow is S0. The present  
value of the inflows is I+F0e-rT. Hence, S0=I+F0e-rT, or equivalently F0=1S0-I2erT.

F0=150-2.1622e0.08*10>12=+51.14
If the forward price were less than this, an arbitrageur would short the stock and 
buy forward contracts. If the forward price were greater than this, an arbitrageur would short forward contracts and buy the stock in the spot market.
We now consider the situation where the asset underlying a forward contract provides a known yield rather than a known cash income. This means that the income is known when expressed as a percentage of the asset’s price at the time the income is paid.  
Suppose that an asset is expected to provide a yield of 5% per annum. This could mean that income is paid once a year and is equal to 5% of the asset price at the time it is paid, in which case the yield would be 5% with annual compounding. Alternatively, it could mean that income is paid twice a year and is equal to 2.5% of the asset price at the time it is paid, in which case the yield would be 5% per annum with semiannual compound-ing. In Section 4.4 we explained that we will normally measure interest rates with  
continuous compounding. Similarly, we will normally measure yields with continuous compounding. Formulas for translating a yield measured with one compounding  
frequency to a yield measured with another compounding frequency are the same as those given for interest rates in Section 4.4.
Define q as the average yield on the asset during time T . If the income is reinvested in 
the asset, the number of units held grows at rate q. One unit of the asset at time zero then grows to 
eqT units of the asset at time T. The strategy
• Borrow S0 to buy one unit of the asset at time zero
• Enter into a forward contract to sell eqT units of the asset at time T for F0
• Close out the forward contract by selling eqT units of the asset at time T
must therefore generate zero profit. Hence,
S0erT=eqTF0
or
 F0=S0e1r-q2T (5. 3)
Example 5.3
Consider a 6-month forward contract on an asset that is expected to provide 
income equal to 2% of the asset price once during a 6-month period. The risk- free rate of interest (with continuous compounding) is 10% per annum. The asset price is $25. In this case, 
S0=25, r=0.10, and T=0.5. The yield is 4% per 
annum with semiannual compounding. From equation (4.3), this is 3.96% per annum with continuous compounding. It follows that 
q=0.0396, so that from 
equation (5.3) the forward price, F0, is given by
F0=25e10.10-0.03962*0.5=+25.775.6 KNOWN YIELD
M05_HULL0654_11_GE_C05.indd   132 30/04/2021   16:46Determination of Forward and Futures Prices 133
The value of a forward contract at the time it is first entered into is close to zero. At a 
later stage, it may prove to have a positive or negative value. It is important for banks and other financial institutions to value the contract each day. (This is referred to as marking to market the contract.) Using the notation introduced earlier, we suppose K  is 
the delivery price for a contract that was negotiated some time ago, the delivery date is T years from today, and r is the T-year risk-free interest rate. The variable 
F0 is the 
forward price that would be applicable if we negotiated the contract today. In addition, we define f to be the value of forward contract today.
It is important to be clear about the meaning of the variables 
F0, K, and f. At the 
beginning of the life of the forward contract, the delivery price, K, is set equal to the forward price at that time and the value of the contract, f, is 0. As time passes, K stays 
the same (because it is part of the definition of the contract), but the forward price changes and the value of the contract becomes either positive or negative.
A general result, applicable to all long forward contracts (both those on investment 
assets and those on consumption assets), is
 
f=1F0-K2e-rT (5. 4)
To see why equation (5.4) is correct, we form a portfolio today consisting of (a) a  
forward contract to buy the underlying asset for K at time T and (b) a forward contract 
to sell the asset for F0 at time T. The payoff from the portfolio at time T is ST-K from 
the first contract and F0-ST from the second contract. The total payoff is F0-K and 
is known for certain today. The portfolio is therefore a risk-free investment and its value 
today is the payoff at time T discounted at the risk-free rate or 1F0-K2e-rT. The value 
of the forward contract to sell the asset for F0 is worth zero because F0 is the forward 
price that applies to a forward contract entered into today. It follows that the value of a  
(long) forward contract to buy an asset for K  at time T  must be 1F0-K2e-rT. Similarly, 
the value of a (short) forward contract to sell the asset for K at time T is 1K-F02e-rT.
Example 5.4
A long forward contract on a non-dividend-paying stock was entered into some time ago. It currently has 6 months to maturity. The risk-free rate of interest (with continuous compounding) is 10% per annum, the stock price is $25, and the  
delivery price is $24. In this case, 
S0=25, r=0.10, T=0.5, and K=24. From 
equation (5.1), the 6-month forward price, F0, is given by
F0=25e0.1*0.5=+26.28
From equation (5.4), the value of the forward contract is
f=126.28-242e-0.1*0.5=+2.17
Equation (5.4) shows that we can value a long forward contract on an asset by making the assumption that the price of the asset at the maturity of the forward contract equals the forward price 
F0. To see this, note that when we make that assumption, a long  
forward contract provides a payoff at time T of F0-K. This has a present value of 
1F0-K2e-rT, which is the value of f in equation (5.4). Similarly, we can value a short 
forward contract on the asset by assuming that the current forward price of the asset is 5.7 VALUING FORWARD CONTRACTS
M05_HULL0654_11_GE_C05.indd   133 30/04/2021   16:46134 CHAPTER 5
realized. These results are analogous to the result in Section 4.9 that we can value a 
forward rate agreement on the assumption that forward rates are realized.
Using equation (5.4) in conjunction with equation (5.1) gives the following expression 
for the value of a forward contract on an investment asset that provides no income
 f=S0-Ke-rT (5. 5)
Similarly, using equation (5.4) in conjunction with equation (5.2) gives the following 
expression for the value of a long forward contract on an investment asset that provides a known income with present value I :
 
f=S0-I-Ke-rT (5. 6)
Finally, using equation (5.4) in conjunction with equation (5.3) gives the following 
expression for the value of a long forward contract on an investment asset that provides a known yield at rate q:
 
f=S0e-qT-Ke-rT (5. 7)
When a futures price changes, the gain or loss on a futures contract is calculated as 
the change in the futures price multiplied by the size of the position. This gain is  
realized almost immediately because futures contracts are settled daily. Equation (5.4) 
shows that, when a forward price changes, the gain or loss is the present value of the change in the forward price multiplied by the size of the position. The difference between the gain/loss on forward and futures contracts can cause confusion on a  
foreign exchange trading desk (see Business Snapshot 5.2).Business Snapshot 5.2 A Systems Error?
A foreign exchange trader working for a bank enters into a long forward contract to buy 1 million pounds sterling at an exchange rate of 1.5000 in 3 months. At the same time, another trader on the next desk takes a long position in 16 contracts for 3-month futures on sterling. The futures price is 1.5000 and each contract is on  
62,500 pounds. The positions taken by the forward and futures traders are therefore the same. Within minutes of the positions being taken, the forward and the futures prices both increase to 1.5040. The bank’s systems show that the futures trader has made a profit of $4,000, while the forward trader has made a profit of only $3,900. The forward trader immediately calls the bank’s systems department to complain. Does the forward trader have a valid complaint?
The answer is no! The daily settlement of futures contracts ensures that the futures 
trader realizes an almost immediate profit corresponding to the increase in the futures price. If the forward trader closed out the position by entering into a short contract at 1.5040, the forward trader would have contracted to buy 1 million pounds  
at 1.5000 in 3 months and sell 1 million pounds at 1.5040 in 3 months. This would lead to a $4,000 profit—but in 3 months, not today. The forward trader’s profit is the present value of $4,000. This is consistent with equation (5.4).
The forward trader can gain some consolation from the fact that gains and losses 
are treated symmetrically. If the forward/futures prices dropped to 1.4960 instead of rising to 1.5040, then the futures trader would take a loss of $4,000 while the forward trader would take a loss of only $3,900.
M05_HULL0654_11_GE_C05.indd   134 30/04/2021   16:46Determination of Forward and Futures Prices 135
Technical Note 24 at www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull/TechnicalNotes provides an  
arbitrage argument to show that, when the short-term risk-free interest rate is constant, 
the forward price for a contract with a certain delivery date is in theory the same as the futures price for a contract with that delivery date. The argument can be extended to cover situations where the interest rate is a known function of time.
When interest rates vary unpredictably (as they do in the real world), forward and 
futures prices are in theory no longer the same. We can get a sense of the nature of the relationship by considering the situation where the price of the underlying asset, S, is strongly positively correlated with interest rates. When S increases, an investor who holds a long futures position makes an immediate gain because of the daily settlement procedure. The positive correlation indicates that it is likely that interest rates have also increased, thereby increasing the rate at which the gain can be invested. Similarly, when S decreases, the investor will incur an immediate loss and it is likely that interest rates have just decreased, thereby reducing the rate at which the loss has to be financed. The positive correlation therefore works in the investor’s favor. An investor holding a  
forward contract rather than a futures contract is not affected in this way by interest  
rate movements. It follows that a long futures contract will be slightly more attractive than a similar long forward contract. Hence, when S is strongly positively correlated with interest rates, futures prices will tend to be slightly higher than forward prices. When S is strongly negatively correlated with interest rates, a similar argument shows 
that forward prices will tend to be slightly higher than futures prices.
The theoretical differences between forward and futures prices for contracts that last 
only a few months are in most circumstances sufficiently small to be ignored. In  
practice, there are a number of factors not reflected in theoretical models that may cause forward and futures prices to be different. These include taxes, transactions costs, and margin requirements. The risk that the counterparty will default may be less in the case of a futures contract because of the role of the exchange clearing house. Also, in some instances, futures contracts are more liquid and easier to trade than forward  
contracts. Despite all these points, for most purposes it is reasonable to assume that forward and futures prices are the same. This is the assumption we will usually make in this book. We will use the symbol 
F0 to represent both the futures price and the forward 
price of an asset today.
One exception to the rule that futures and forward contracts can be assumed to be 
the same concerns interest rate futures. This will be discussed in Section 6.3.5.8 ARE FORWARD PRICES AND FUTURES PRICES EQUAL?
We introduced futures on stock indices in Section 3.5 and showed how a stock index 
futures contract is a useful tool in managing equity portfolios. Table 3.3 shows futures prices for a number of different indices. We are now in a position to consider how index futures prices are determined.
A stock index can usually be regarded as the price of an investment asset that pays 
dividends.
5 The investment asset is the portfolio of stocks underlying the index, and the 5.9 FUTURES PRICES OF STOCK INDICES
5 One exception here is the contract in Business Snapshot 5.3.
M05_HULL0654_11_GE_C05.indd   135 30/04/2021   16:46136 CHAPTER 5
dividends paid by the investment asset are the dividends that would be received by the 
holder of this portfolio. It is usually assumed that the dividends provide a known yield rather than a known cash income. If q is the dividend yield rate (expressed with  
continuous compounding), equation (5.3) gives the futures price, 
F0, as
 F0=S0e1r-q2T (5. 8)
This shows that the futures price increases at rate r-q with the maturity of the futures 
contract. In Table 3.3, the S&P 500 settlements are declining at roughly 0.5% per six 
months, or 1% per year. This indicates that the dividend yield anticipated by the  
market on the S&P 500 during the first year was about 1% per annum greater than the risk-free rate.
Example 5.5
Consider a 3-month futures contract on an index. Suppose that the stocks under -
lying the index provide a dividend yield of 1% per annum (continuously com-
pounded), that the current value of the index is 1,300, and that the continuously compounded risk-free interest rate is 5% per annum. In this case, 
r=0.05, 
S0=1,300, T=0.25, and q=0.01. Hence, the futures price, F0, is given by
F0=1,300e10.05-0.012*0.25=+1,313.07
In practice, the dividend yield on the portfolio underlying an index varies week by week throughout the year. For example, a large proportion of the dividends on the NYSE stocks are paid in the first week of February, May, August, and November each year. The chosen value of q  should represent the average annualized dividend yield during the 
life of the contract. The dividends used for estimating q should be those for which the 
ex-dividend date is during the life of the futures contract.Business Snapshot 5.3 The CME Nikkei 225 Futures Contract
The arguments in this chapter on how index futures prices are determined require that the index be the value of an investment asset. This means that it must be the value of a portfolio of assets that can be traded. The asset underlying the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s futures contract on the Nikkei 225 Index does not qualify, and the reason why is quite subtle. Suppose S is the value of the Nikkei 225 Index. This is the value of a portfolio of 225 Japanese stocks measured in yen. The variable underlying the CME futures contract on the Nikkei 225 has a dollar value of 5S. In other words, the futures contract takes a variable that is measured in yen and treats it as though it is dollars.
We cannot invest in a portfolio whose value will always be 5S  dollars. The best we 
can do is to invest in one that is always worth 5S yen or in one that is always worth 
5QS dollars, where Q is the dollar value of 1 yen. The variable 5S dollars is not, 
therefore, the price of an investment asset and equation (5.8) does not apply.
CME’s Nikkei 225 futures contract is an example of a quanto. A quanto is a 
derivative where the underlying asset is measured in one currency and the payoff is in another currency. Quantos will be discussed further in Chapter 30.
M05_HULL0654_11_GE_C05.indd   136 30/04/2021   16:46Determination of Forward and Futures Prices 137
Index Arbitrage
If F07S0e1r-q2T, profits can be made by buying the stocks underlying the index at the 
spot price (i.e., for immediate delivery) and shorting futures contracts. If F06S0e1r-q2T, 
profits can be made by doing the reverse—that is, shorting or selling the stocks  
underlying the index and taking a long position in futures contracts. These strategies 
are known as index arbitrage. When F06S0e1r-q2T, index arbitrage is often done by a 
pension fund that owns an indexed portfolio of stocks. When F07S0e1r-q2T, it might be 
done by a bank or a corporation holding short-term money market investments. For indices involving many stocks, index arbitrage is sometimes accomplished by trading a relatively small representative sample of stocks whose movements closely mirror those of the index. Usually index arbitrage is implemented through program trading. This involves using a computer system to generate the trades.
Most of the time the activities of arbitrageurs ensure that equation (5.8) holds, but 
occasionally arbitrage is impossible and the futures price does get out of line with the spot price (see Business Snapshot 5.4).Business Snapshot 5.4 Index Arbitrage in October 1987
To do index arbitrage, a trader must be able to trade both the index futures contract and the portfolio of stocks underlying the index very quickly at the prices quoted in the market. In normal market conditions this is possible using program trading, and the relationship in equation (5.8) holds well. Examples of days when the market was anything but normal are October 19 and 20 of 1987. On what is termed “Black  
Monday, ” October 19, 1987, the market fell by more than 20%, and the 604 million shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange easily exceeded all previous records. The exchange’s systems were overloaded, and orders placed to buy or sell shares on that day could be delayed by up to two hours before being executed.
For most of October 19, 1987, futures prices were at a significant discount to the 
underlying index. For example, at the close of trading the S&P 500 Index was at 225.06 (down 57.88 on the day), whereas the futures price for December delivery on the S&P 500 was 201.50 (down 80.75 on the day). This was largely because the delays in processing orders made index arbitrage impossible. On the next day, Tuesday, October 20, 1987, the New York Stock Exchange placed temporary restrictions on the way in which program trading could be done. This also made index arbitrage very difficult and the breakdown of the traditional linkage between stock indices and stock index futures continued. At one point the futures price for the December contract was 18% less than the S&P 500 Index. However, after a few days the market returned to normal, and the activities of arbitrageurs ensured that equation (5.8) governed the relationship between futures and spot prices of indices.
We now move on to consider forward and futures foreign currency contracts. For the sake of definiteness we will assume that the domestic currency is the U.S. dollar (i.e., we 5.10 FORWARD AND FUTURES CONTRACTS ON CURRENCIES
M05_HULL0654_11_GE_C05.indd   137 30/04/2021   16:46138 CHAPTER 5
take the perspective of a U.S. investor). The underlying asset is one unit of the foreign 
currency. We will therefore define the variable S0 as the current spot price in U.S. 
dollars of one unit of the foreign currency and F0 as the forward or futures price in U.S. 
dollars of one unit of the foreign currency. This is consistent with the way we have defined 
S0 and F0 for other assets underlying forward and futures contracts. However, 
as mentioned in Section 2.11, it does not necessarily correspond to the way spot and forward exchange rates are quoted. For major exchange rates other than the British pound, euro, Australian dollar, and New Zealand dollar, a spot or forward exchange rate is normally quoted as the number of units of the currency that are equivalent to one U.S. dollar.
A foreign currency has the property that the holder of the currency can earn interest 
at the risk-free interest rate prevailing in the foreign country. For example, the holder can invest the currency in a foreign-denominated bond. We define 
rf as the value of the 
foreign risk-free interest rate when money is invested for time T. The variable r is the domestic risk-free rate when money is invested for this period of time.
The relationship between 
F0 and S0 is
 F0=S0e1r-rf2T (5. 9)
This is the well-known interest rate parity relationship from international finance. The reason it is true is illustrated in Figure 5.1. Suppose that an individual starts with  
1,000 units of the foreign currency. There are two ways it can be converted to dollars at time T. One is by investing it for T years at 
rf and entering into a forward contract to 
sell the proceeds for dollars at time T . This generates 1,000erfT F0 dollars. The other is 
by exchanging the foreign currency for dollars in the spot market and investing the proceeds for T  years at rate r . This generates 
1,000S0erT dollars. In the absence of  1000 units of

arbitrage opportunities, the two strategies must give the same result. Hence,
1,000erfT F0=1,000S0erT
so that
F0=S0e1r-rf2T
Example 5.6
Suppose that the 2-year interest rates in Australia and the United States are 3% 
and 1%, respectively, and the spot exchange rate is 0.7500 USD per AUD. From equation (5.9), the 2-year forward exchange rate should be
0.7500e10.01-0.032*2=0.7206
Suppose first that the 2-year forward exchange rate is less than this, say 0.7000. An arbitrageur can:
1. Borrow 1,000 AUD at 3% per annum for 2 years, convert to 750 USD and invest the USD at 1% (both rates are continuously compounded).
2. Enter into a forward contract to buy 1,061.84 AUD for 
1,061.84*0.7000 = 
743.29 USD in 2 years.
The 750 USD that are invested at 1% grow to 750e0.01*2=765.15 USD in  
2 years. Of this, 743.29 USD are used to purchase 1,061.84 AUD under the terms of the forward contract. This is exactly enough to repay principal and interest on the 1,000 AUD that are borrowed 
11,000e0.03*2=1,061.842. The strategy there-
fore gives rise to a riskless profit of 765.15-743.29=21.87 USD. (If this does 
not sound very exciting, consider following a similar strategy where you borrow 100 million AUD!)
Suppose next that the 2-year forward rate is 0.7600 (greater than the 0.7206 
value given by equation (5.9)). An arbitrageur can:
1. Borrow 1,000 USD at 1% per annum for 2 years, convert to 
1,000>0.7500 = 
1,333.33 AUD, and invest the AUD at 3%.
2. Enter into a forward contract to sell 1,415.79 AUD for 1,415.79*0.76 = 
1,075.99 USD in 2 years.
The 1,333.33 AUD that are invested at 3% grow to 1,333.33e0.03*2 =  
1,415.79 AUD in 2 years. The forward contract has the effect of converting this 
to 1,075.99 USD. The amount needed to payoff the USD borrowings is 
1,000e0.01*2=1,020.20 USD. The strategy therefore gives rise to a riskless profit 
of 1,075.99-1,020.20=55.79 USD.
Table 5.4 shows currency futures quotes on May 21, 2020. The quotes are U.S. dollars 
per unit of the foreign currency. (In the case of the Japanese yen, the quote is  
U.S. dollars per 100 yen.) This is the usual quotation convention for futures contracts. 
Equation (5.9) applies with r  equal to the U.S. risk-free rate and rf equal to the foreign 
risk-free rate. The size of one contract is indicated at the top of each segment of the table.
For all the currencies considered in the table, short-term interest rates were lower 
than on the U.S. dollar. This corresponds to the r7rf situation and explains why 
the settlement futures prices of these currencies increase with maturity. The CME launched futures on the cryptocurrency bitcoin in December 2017. The table shows 
M05_HULL0654_11_GE_C05.indd   139 30/04/2021   16:46140 CHAPTER 5
that, on May 21, 2020, one bitcoin was worth about $9000. Settlement of the contract is 
in cash on the last Friday of the month.
Example 5.7
In Table 5.4, the September settlement price for the euro is about 0.2% higher 
than the June settlement price, and the December settlement price is about 0.2% 
higher than the September settlement price. This indicates that the futures prices are increasing at about 
4*0.2=0.8, per year with maturity. From equation ( 5.9) 
this is a rough estimate of the amount by which short-term euro interest rates were less than short-term U.S. interest rates in May 2020.
A Foreign Currency as an Asset Providing a Known Yield
Equation (5.9) is identical to equation (5.3) with q replaced by rf. This is not a  
coincidence. A foreign currency can be regarded as an investment asset paying a known yield. The yield is the risk-free rate of interest in the foreign currency.Table 5.4 Futures quotes for a selection of CME Group contracts on foreign

To understand this, we note that the value of interest paid in a foreign currency 
depends on the value of the foreign currency. Suppose that the interest rate on British 
pounds is 5% per annum. To a U.S. investor the British pound provides an income  
equal to 5% of the value of the British pound per annum. In other words it is an asset that provides a yield of 5% per annum.
6 Recall that, for an asset to be an investment asset, it need not be held solely for investment purposes. What 
is required is that some individuals hold it for investment purposes and that these individuals be prepared to 
sell their holdings and go long forward contracts, if the latter look more attractive. This explains why silver, although it has industrial uses, is an investment asset.We now move on to consider futures contracts on commodities. First we look at the 
futures prices of commodities that are investment assets such as gold and silver.6 We 
then go on to examine the futures prices of consumption assets.
Income and Storage Costs
As explained in Business Snapshot 3.1, the hedging strategies of gold producers leads to  
a requirement on the part of investment banks to borrow gold. Gold owners such as central banks charge interest in the form of what is known as the gold lease rate when they lend gold. The same is true of silver. Gold and silver can therefore provide income to the holder. Like other commodities they also have storage costs.
Equation (5.1) shows that, in the absence of storage costs and income, the forward 
price of a commodity that is an investment asset is given by
 
F0=S0erT (5. 10)
Storage costs can be treated as negative income. If U is the present value of all the 
storage costs, net of income, during the life of a forward contract, it follows from  
equation (5.2) that
 F0=1S0+U2erT (5. 11)
Example 5.8
Consider a 1 -year futures contract on an investment asset that provides no income. 
It costs $2 per unit to store the asset, with the payment being made at the end of the year. Assume that the spot price is $450 per unit and the risk-free rate is 7% per annum for all maturities. This corresponds to 
r=0.07, S0=450, T=1, and
U=2e-0.07*1=1.865
From equation (5.11), the theoretical futures price, F0, is given by
F0=1450+1.8652e0.07*1=+484.63
If the actual futures price is greater than 484.63, an arbitrageur can buy the asset and short 1 -year futures contracts to lock in a profit. If the actual futures price is less than 484.63, an investor who already owns the asset can improve the return by selling the asset and buying futures contracts.5.11 FUTURES ON COMMODITIES
M05_HULL0654_11_GE_C05.indd   141 30/04/2021   16:46142 CHAPTER 5
If the storage costs (net of income) incurred at any time are proportional to the price of 
the commodity, they can be treated as negative yield. In this case, from equation (5.3),
 F0=S0e1r+u2T (5. 12)
where u denotes the storage costs per annum as a proportion of the spot price net of 
any yield earned on the asset.
Consumption Commodities
Commodities that are consumption assets rather than investment assets usually  
provide no income, but can be subject to significant storage costs. We now review  
the arbitrage strategies used to determine futures prices from spot prices carefully.7 
Suppose that, instead of equation (5.11), we have 
F071S0+U2erT (5. 13)
To take advantage of this opportunity, an arbitrageur can implement the following 
strategy:
1. Borrow an amount S0+U at the risk-free rate and use it to purchase one unit of 
the commodity and to pay storage costs.
2. Short a futures contract on one unit of the commodity.
If we regard the futures contract as a forward contract, so that there is no daily  
settlement, this strategy leads to a profit of F0-1S0+U2erT at time T . There is no 
problem in implementing the strategy for any commodity. However, as arbitrageurs do so, there will be a tendency for 
S0 to increase and F0 to decrease until equation (5.13) is no 
longer true. We conclude that equation (5.13) cannot hold for any significant length of time.
Suppose next that
 
F061S0+U2erT (5. 14)
When the commodity is an investment asset, we can argue that many investors hold the commodity solely for investment. When they observe the inequality in equation (5.14), they will find it profitable to do the following:
1. Sell the commodity, save the storage costs, and invest the proceeds at the risk-free interest rate.
2. Take a long position in a futures contract.
The result is a riskless profit at maturity of 
1S0+U2erT-F0 relative to the position 
the investors would have been in if they had held the commodity. It follows that  
equation (5.14) cannot hold for long. Because neither equation (5.13) nor (5.14) can hold for long, we must have 
F0=1S0+U2erT.
This argument cannot be used for a commodity that is a consumption asset rather 
than an investment asset. Individuals and companies who own a consumption  
commodity usually plan to use it in some way. They are reluctant to sell the  
commodity in the spot market and buy forward or futures contracts, because forward 
7 For some commodities the spot price depends on the delivery location. We assume that the delivery  
location for spot and futures are the same.
M05_HULL0654_11_GE_C05.indd   142 30/04/2021   16:46Determination of Forward and Futures Prices 143
and futures contracts cannot be used in a manufacturing process or consumed in some 
other way. There is therefore nothing to stop equation (5.14) from holding, and all we can assert for a consumption commodity is
 
F0…1S0+U2erT (5. 15)
If storage costs are expressed as a proportion u  of the spot price, the equivalent result is
 F0…S0e1r+u2T (5. 16)
Convenience Yields
We do not necessarily have equality in equations (5.15) and (5.16) because users of a 
consumption commodity may feel that ownership of the physical commodity provides benefits that are not obtained by holders of futures contracts. For example, an oil  
refiner is unlikely to regard a futures contract on crude oil in the same way as crude oil held in inventory. The crude oil in inventory can be an input to the refining process, whereas a futures contract cannot be used for this purpose. In general, ownership of the physical asset enables a manufacturer to keep a production process running and  
perhaps profit from temporary local shortages. A futures contract does not do the  
same. The benefits from holding the physical asset are sometimes referred to as the convenience yield provided by the commodity. If the dollar amount of storage costs is known and has a present value U, then the convenience yield y is defined such that
F0eyT=1S0+U2erT
If the storage costs per unit are a constant proportion, u, of the spot price, then y is defined so that
F0eyT=S0e1r+u2T
or
 F0=S0e1r+u-y2T (5. 17)
The convenience yield simply measures the extent to which the left-hand side is less than 
the right-hand side in equation (5.15) or (5.16). For investment assets the convenience yield must be zero; otherwise, there are arbitrage opportunities. Table 2.2 in Chapter 2 shows that, on May 21, 2020, the futures price of soybeans decreased as the maturity of the contract increased from January 2021 to May 2021. This pattern suggests that the convenience yield, y , is greater than 
r+u during this period.
The convenience yield reflects the market’s expectations concerning the future avail-
ability of the commodity. The greater the possibility that shortages will occur, the higher the convenience yield. If users of the commodity have high inventories, there is very little chance of shortages in the near future and the convenience yield tends to be low. If inventories are low, shortages are more likely and the convenience yield is usually higher.
The relationship between futures prices and spot prices can be summarized in terms of 
the cost of carry. This measures the storage cost plus the interest that is paid to finance 5.12 THE COST OF CARRY
M05_HULL0654_11_GE_C05.indd   143 30/04/2021   16:46144 CHAPTER 5
the asset less the income earned on the asset. For a non-dividend-paying stock, the  
cost of carry is r, because there are no storage costs and no income is earned; for a  
stock index, it is r-q, because income is earned at rate q on the asset. For a currency, 
it is r-rf; for a commodity that provides income at rate q and requires storage costs 
at rate u, it is r-q+u; and so on.
Define the cost of carry as c. For an investment asset, the futures price is
 F0=S0ecT (5. 18)
For a consumption asset, it is
 F0=S0e1c-y2T (5. 19)
where y is the convenience yield.
Whereas a forward contract normally specifies that delivery is to take place on a 
particular day, a futures contract often allows the party with the short position to choose to deliver at any time during a certain period. (Typically the party has to give a few days’ notice of its intention to deliver.) The choice introduces a complication into the determination of futures prices. Should the maturity of the futures contract be assumed to be the beginning, middle, or end of the delivery period? Even though most futures contracts are closed out prior to maturity, it is important to know when delivery would have taken place in order to calculate the theoretical futures price.
If the futures price is an increasing function of the time to maturity, it can be seen 
from equation (5.19) that 
c7y, so that the benefits from holding the asset (including 
convenience yield and net of storage costs) are less than the risk-free rate. It is  
usually optimal in such a case for the party with the short position to deliver as early as possible, because the interest earned on the cash received outweighs the benefits of holding the asset. As a rule, futures prices in these circumstances should be  
calculated on the basis that delivery will take place at the beginning of the delivery period. If futures prices are decreasing as time to maturity increases 
1c6y2, the 
reverse is true. It is then usually optimal for the party with the short position to  
deliver as late as possible, and futures prices should, as a rule, be calculated on this assumption.5.13 DELIVERY OPTIONS
We refer to the market’s average opinion about what the spot price of an asset will be at a certain future time as the expected spot price of the asset at that time. Suppose that it is now June and the September futures price of corn is 450 cents. It is interesting to ask what the expected spot price of corn in September is. Is it less than 450 cents, greater than 450 cents, or exactly equal to 450 cents? As illustrated in Figure 2.1, the futures price converges to the spot price at maturity. If the expected spot price is less than  
450 cents, the market must be expecting the September futures price to decline, so that traders with short positions gain and traders with long positions lose. If the expected spot price is greater than 450 cents, the reverse must be true. The market must be 5.14 FUTURES PRICES AND EXPECTED FUTURE SPOT PRICES

expecting the September futures price to increase, so that traders with long positions 
gain while those with short positions lose.
Keynes and Hicks
Economists John Maynard Keynes and John Hicks argued that, if hedgers tend to hold short positions and speculators tend to hold long positions, the futures price of an asset will be below the expected spot price.
8 This is because speculators require compensation 
for the risks they are bearing. They will trade only if they can expect to make money on average. Hedgers will lose money on average, but they are likely to be prepared to accept this because the futures contract reduces their risks. If hedgers tend to hold long positions while speculators hold short positions, Keynes and Hicks argued that the futures price will be above the expected spot price for a similar reason.
Risk and Return
The modern approach to explaining the relationship between futures prices and expected spot prices is based on the relationship between risk and expected return in the economy. In general, the higher the risk of an investment, the higher the expected return demanded by an investor. The capital asset pricing model, which is explained in the appendix to Chapter 3, shows that there are two types of risk in the economy:  
systematic and nonsystematic. Nonsystematic risk should not be important to an  
investor. It can be almost completely eliminated by holding a well-diversified portfolio. An investor should not therefore require a higher expected return for bearing non- systematic risk. Systematic risk, in contrast, cannot be diversified away. It arises from a correlation between returns from the investment and returns from the whole stock market. An investor generally requires a higher expected return than the risk-free interest rate for bearing positive amounts of systematic risk. Also, an investor is  
prepared to accept a lower expected return than the risk-free interest rate when the systematic risk in an investment is negative.
The Risk in a Futures Position
Let us consider a speculator who takes a long position in a futures contract that lasts for T years in the hope that the spot price of the asset will be above the futures price at the 
end of the life of the futures contract. We ignore daily settlement and assume that the futures contract can be treated as a forward contract. We suppose that the speculator puts the present value of the futures price into a risk-free investment while simul-  
taneously taking a long futures position. The proceeds of the risk-free investment are used to buy the asset on the delivery date. The asset is then immediately sold for its market price. The cash flows to the speculator are as follows:
Today:  
-F0e-rT
End of futures contract:  +ST
where F0 is the futures price today, ST is the price of the asset at time T  at the end of the 
futures contract, and r  is the risk-free return on funds invested for time T .

M05_HULL0654_11_GE_C05.indd   145 30/04/2021   16:46146 CHAPTER 5
How do we value this investment? The discount rate we should use for the expected 
cash flow at time T equals an investor’s required return on the investment. Suppose that 
k is an investor’s required return for this investment. The present value of this  
investment is
-F0e-rT+E1ST2e-kT
where E denotes expected value. We can assume that all investments in securities  
markets are priced so that they have zero net present value. This means that
-F0e-rT+E1ST2e-kT=0
or
 F0=E1ST2e1r-k2T (5. 20)
As we have just discussed, the returns investors require on an investment depend on its 
systematic risk. The investment we have been considering is in essence an investment in the asset underlying the futures contract. If the returns from this asset are uncorrelated with the stock market, the correct discount rate to use is the risk-free rate r , so we 
should set 
k=r. Equation (5.20) then gives
F0=E1ST2
This shows that the futures price is an unbiased estimate of the expected future spot price when the return from the underlying asset is uncorrelated with the stock market.
If the return from the asset is positively correlated with the stock market, 
k7r and 
equation (5.20) leads to F06E1ST2. This shows that, when the asset underlying the 
futures contract has positive systematic risk, we should expect the futures price to understate the expected future spot price. An example of an asset that has positive systematic risk is a stock index. The expected return of investors on the stocks underlying an index is generally more than the risk-free rate, r. The dividends provide a return of q. 
The expected increase in the index must therefore be more than 
r-q. Equation (5.8) is 
therefore consistent with the prediction that the futures price understates the expected future stock price for a stock index.
If the return from the asset is negatively correlated with the stock market, 
k6r and 
equation (5.20) gives F07E1ST2. This shows that, when the asset underlying the futures 
contract has negative systematic risk, we should expect the futures price to overstate the expected future spot price.
These results are summarized in Table 5.5.

Normal Backwardation and Contango
When the futures price is below the expected future spot price, the situation is known as 
normal backwardation; and when the futures price is above the expected future spot price, the situation is known as contango. However, it should be noted that sometimes these terms are used to refer to whether the futures price is below or above the current spot price, rather than the expected future spot price.
SUMMARY
For most purposes, the futures price of a contract with a certain delivery date can be considered to be the same as the forward price for a contract with the same delivery date. It can be shown that in theory the two should be exactly the same when interest rates are perfectly predictable.
For the purposes of understanding futures (or forward) prices, it is convenient to 
divide futures contracts into two categories: those in which the underlying asset is held for investment by at least some traders and those in which the underlying asset is held primarily for consumption purposes.
In the case of investment assets, we have considered three different situations:
1. The asset provides no income.
2. The asset provides a known dollar income.
3. The asset provides a known yield.
The results are summarized in Table 5.6. They enable futures prices to be obtained for contracts on stock indices, currencies, gold, and silver. Storage costs can be treated as negative income.
In the case of consumption assets, it is not possible to obtain the futures price as a 
function of the spot price and other observable variables. Here the parameter known as the asset’s convenience yield becomes important. It measures the extent to which users of the commodity feel that ownership of the physical asset provides benefits that are not obtained by the holders of the futures contract. These benefits may include the ability to profit from temporary local shortages or the ability to keep a production process running. We can obtain an upper bound for the futures price of consumption assets using arbitrage arguments, but we cannot nail down an equality relationship between futures and spot prices.

The concept of cost of carry is sometimes useful. The cost of carry is the storage cost 
of the underlying asset plus the cost of financing it minus the income received from it. 
In the case of investment assets, the futures price is greater than the spot price by an amount reflecting the cost of carry. In the case of consumption assets, the futures price is greater than the spot price by an amount reflecting the cost of carry net of the  
convenience yield.
If we assume the capital asset pricing model is true, the relationship between the 
futures price and the expected future spot price depends on whether the return on the asset is positively or negatively correlated with the return on the stock market. Positive correlation will tend to lead to a futures price lower than the expected future spot price, whereas negative correlation will tend to lead to a futures price higher than the expected future spot price. Only when the correlation is zero will the theoretical futures price be equal to the expected future spot price.

 5.9. Assume that the risk-free interest rate is 4% per annum with continuous compounding and that the dividend yield on a stock index varies throughout the year. In February,  
May, August, and November, dividends are paid at a rate of 5% per annum. In other months, dividends are paid at a rate of 2% per annum. Suppose that the value of the index on July 31 is 1,300. What is the futures price for a contract deliverable in December 31 of the same year?
 5.10.  Suppose that the risk-free interest rate is 6% per annum with continuous compounding and that the dividend yield on a stock index is 4% per annum.

assume that a futures contract is the same as a forward contract.
 5.15.  When a known future cash outflow in a foreign currency is hedged by a company using a forward contract, there is no foreign exchange risk. When it is hedged using futures  
contracts, the daily settlement process does leave the company exposed to some risk. Explain the nature of this risk. In particular, consider whether the company is better off  using a futures contract or a forward contract when:
(a) The value of the foreign currency falls rapidly during the life of the contract.

Assume that speculators tend to be short crude oil futures and hedgers tend to be long. What does the Keynes and Hicks argument imply about the expected future price of oil?
 5.19.  The Value Line Index is designed to reflect changes in the value of a portfolio of over  
1,600 equally weighted stocks. Prior to March 9, 1988, the change in the index from one day to the next was calculated as the geometric average of the changes in the prices of the 
stocks underlying the index. In these circumstances, does equation (5.8) correctly relate the futures price of the index to its cash price? If not, does the equation overstate or understate the futures price?

rf as the interest rate (all maturities) on the Australian dollar. Assume  
that r and rf are constant and that the company uses a contract expiring at time T to  
hedge an exposure at time t 1T7t2.
(a) Show that the optimal hedge ratio is e1rf-r21T-t2, ignoring daily settlement.
(b) Show that, when t  is 1 day, the optimal hedge ratio is almost exactly S0>F0, where S0 is

 5.22.  The spot exchange rate between the Swiss franc and U.S. dollar is 1.0404 ($ per franc). 
Interest rates in the United States and Switzerland are 0.25% and 0% per annum,  
respectively, with continuous compounding. The 3-month forward exchange rate was 1.0300 ($ per franc). What arbitrage strategy was possible? How does your answer change if the forward exchange rate is 1.0500 ($ per franc).
 5.23.  An index is 1,200. The three-month risk-free rate is 3% per annum and the dividend yield over the next three months is 1.2% per annum. The six-month risk-free rate is 3.5% per annum and the dividend yield over the next six months is 1% per annum. Estimate the futures price of the index for three-month and six-month contracts. All interest rates and dividend yields are continuously compounded.
 5.24.  Suppose the current USD/euro exchange rate is 1.2000 dollar per euro. The six-month forward exchange rate is 1.1950. The six-month USD interest rate is 1% per annum  
continuously compounded. Estimate the six-month euro interest rate.
 5.25.  The spot price of oil is $50 per barrel and the cost of storing a barrel of oil for one year is $3, payable at the end of the year. The risk-free interest rate is 5% per annum  
continuously compounded. What is an upper bound for the one-year futures price of oil?
 5.26.  A company that is uncertain about the exact date when it will pay or receive a foreign currency may try to negotiate with its bank a forward contract that specifies a period during which delivery can be made. The company wants to reserve the right to choose the exact delivery date to fit in with its own cash flows. Put yourself in the position of the  
bank. How would you price the product that the company wants?
 5.27.  A company enters into a forward contract with a bank to sell a foreign currency for 
K1 at 
time T1. The exchange rate at time T1 proves to be S1 17K12. The company asks the bank 
if it can roll the contract forward until time T2 17T12 rather than settle at time T1. The 
bank agrees to a new delivery price, K2. Explain how K2 should be calculated.

Interest Rate 
Futures 6CHAPTER
So far we have covered futures contracts on commodities, stock indices, and foreign 
currencies. We have seen how they work, how they are used for hedging, and how futures prices are determined. We now move on to consider interest rate futures.
This chapter explains the contracts that trade in the United States. Many of the other 
interest rate futures contracts throughout the world have been modeled on these con­tracts. The chapter also shows how interest rate futures contracts, when used in con­junction with the duration measure introduced in Chapter 4, can be used to hedge a company’s exposure to interest rate movements.
6.1 DAY COUNT AND QUOTATION CONVENTIONS
As a preliminary to the material in this chapter, we consider the day count and quotation conventions that apply to bonds and other instruments dependent on interest rates.
Day Counts
The day count defines the way in which interest accrues over time. Generally, we know the interest earned over some reference period (e.g., the time between coupon payments on a bond), and we are interested in calculating the interest earned over some other period.
The day count convention is usually expressed as 
X>Y. When we are calculating the 
interest earned between two dates, X defines the way in which the number of days between the two dates is calculated, and Y  defines the way in which the total number of 
days in the reference period is measured. The interest earned between the two dates is
Number of days between dates
Number of days in reference period*Interest earned in reference period
Three day count conventions that are commonly used in the United States are:
1. Actual/actual (in period)
2. 30>360

The actual/actual (in period) day count is used for Treasury bonds in the United 
States. This means that the interest earned between two dates is based on the ratio of the 
actual days elapsed to the actual number of days in the period between coupon  
payments. Assume that the bond principal is $100, coupon payment dates are March 1 and September 1, and the coupon rate is 8% per annum. (This means that $4 of interest is paid on each of March 1 and September 1.) Suppose that we wish to calculate the interest earned between March 1 and July 3. The reference period is from March 1 to September 1. There are 184 (actual) days in the reference period, and interest of $4 is earned during the period. There are 124 (actual) days between March 1 and July 3. The interest earned between March 1 and July 3 is therefore
124
184*4=2.6957
The 30>360 day count is used for corporate and municipal bonds in the United States. This means that we assume 30 days per month and 360 days per year when carrying out calculations. With the 30>360 day count, the total number of days between March 1 and September 1 is 180. The total number of days between March 1 and July 3 is 
14*302+2=122. In a corporate bond with the same terms as the Treasury bond 
just considered, the interest earned between March 1 and July 3 would therefore be
122
180*4=2.7111
As shown in Business Snapshot 6.1, sometimes the 30>360 day count convention has surprising consequences.
The actual> 360 day count is used for money market instruments in the United States. 
This indicates that the reference period is 360 days. The interest earned during part of a year is calculated by dividing the actual number of elapsed days by 360 and multiplying by the rate. The interest earned in 90 days is therefore exactly one­fourth of the quoted rate, and the interest earned in a whole year of 365 days is 365> 360 times the quoted rate.
Conventions vary from country to country and from instrument to instrument. For 
example, money market instruments are quoted on an actual>365 basis in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. LIBOR is quoted on an actual>360 for all currencies except sterling, for which it is quoted on an actual>365 basis. Euro­denominated and sterling bonds are usually quoted on an actual/actual basis.Business Snapshot 6.1 Day Counts Can Be Deceptive
Between February 28, 2018, and March 1, 2018, you have a choice between owning a  
U.S. government bond and a U.S. corporate bond. They pay the same coupon and have the same quoted price. Assuming no risk of default, which would you prefer?
It sounds as though you should be indifferent, but in fact you should have a 
marked preference for the corporate bond. Under the 30>360 day count convention used for corporate bonds, there are 3 days between February 28, 2018, and March 1, 2018. Under the actual/actual (in period) day count convention used for government bonds, there is only 1 day. You would earn approximately three times as much  
interest by holding the corporate bond!

Price Quotations of U.S. Treasury Bills
The prices of money market instruments are sometimes quoted using a discount rate. 
This is the interest earned as a percentage of the final face value rather than as a  
percentage of the initial price paid for the instrument. An example is Treasury bills in the United States. If the price of a 91­day Treasury bill is quoted as 8, this means that the rate of interest earned is 8% of the face value per 360 days. Suppose that the face value is $100. Interest of 
$2.02221= $100*0.08*91>3602 is earned over the 91 ­day 
life. This corresponds to a true rate of interest of 2.0222>1100-2.02222=2.064% for  
the 91 ­day period. In general, the relationship between the cash price per $100 of face 
value and the quoted price of a Treasury bill in the United States is
P=360
n1100-Y2
where P is the quoted price, Y  is the cash price, and n  is the remaining life of the  
Treasury bill measured in calendar days. For example, when the cash price of a 90­day Treasury bill is 99, the quoted price is 4.
Price Quotations of U.S. Treasury Bonds
Treasury bond prices in the United States are quoted in dollars and thirty ­seconds of a  
dollar. The quoted price is for a bond with a face value of $100. Thus, a quote of  
120­05 or 1205
32 indicates that the quoted price for a bond with a face value of $100,000 
is $120,156.25.
The quoted price, which traders refer to as the clean price, is not the same as the 
cash price paid by the purchaser of the bond, which is referred to by traders as the dirty price. In general,
Cash price=Quoted price+Accrued interest since last coupon date
To illustrate this formula, suppose that it is March 5, 2018, and the bond under  
consideration is an 11% coupon bond maturing on July 10, 2038, with a quoted price of 155­16 or $155.50. Because coupons are paid semiannually on government bonds (and the final coupon is at maturity), the most recent coupon date is January 10, 2018, and the next coupon date is July 10, 2018. The (actual) number of days between January 10, 2018, and March 5, 2018, is 54, whereas the (actual) number of days between January 10, 2018, and July 10, 2018, is 181. On a bond with $100 face value, the coupon payment is $5.50 on January 10 and July 10. The accrued interest on March 5, 2018, is the share of the  
July 10 coupon accruing to the bondholder on March 5, 2018. Because actual/actual in period is used for Treasury bonds in the United States, this is
54
181*$5.50=$1.64
The cash price per $100 face value for the bond is therefore
$155.50+$1.64=$157.14
Thus, the cash price of a $100,000 bond is $157,140.
M06_HULL0654_11_GE_C06.indd   154 12/05/2021   17:21Interest Rate Futures 155
Table 6.1 shows interest rate futures quotes on May 21, 2020. Trading in the Ultra T ­ 
bond futures contract started in 2010. Any government bond with a maturity over  
25 years can be delivered by the party with the short position under the terms of this 
contract. In the T ­bond futures contract, any government bond that has a maturity 
between 15 and 25 years can be delivered.
A Treasury note is a Treasury bond with maturity between one and ten years. As can 
be seen from the volume of trading, the 10­year, 5­year, and 2­year Treasury note futures contracts with short maturities are very popular. In the 10­year Treasury note futures contract, any note with a maturity between 
61
2 and 10 years can be delivered. In 
the 5­year and 2­year Treasury note futures contracts, the note delivered has a remaining life of about 5 years and 2 years, respectively, and the original life must be less than 5.25 years.
The 30­day Fed Funds Rate contract has a settlement price equal to 100 minus the 
arithmetic average of the federal funds rate during the contract month. The Eurodollar and SOFR contracts will be discussed in Section 6.3.
Quotes
Ultra T ­bond futures and Treasury bond futures contracts are quoted in dollars and 
thirty ­seconds of a dollar per $100 face value. This is similar to the way the bonds are 
quoted in the spot market. In Table 6.1, the settlement price of the June 2020 Treasury bond futures contract is specified as 179­20. This means 
17920
32, or 179.625. The  
settlement price of the 10­year Treasury note futures contract is quoted to the nearest half of a thirty ­second. Thus the settlement price of 139­025 for the June 2020 contract 
should be interpreted as 
1392.5
32, or 139.078125. The 5­year and 2­year Treasury note 
contracts are quoted even more precisely, to the nearest quarter of a thirty ­second. Thus 
the opening price of 125­132 for the September 2020 5­year Treasury note contract should be interpreted as 
12513.25
32, or 125.4140625. Similarly, the settlement price of 110­
127 for September 2020 2­year Treasury note contract should be interpreted as 11012.75
32, 
or 110.3984375.
Conversion Factors
When a particular bond is delivered in a CME group bond futures contract, a parameter known as its conversion factor defines the price received for the bond by the party with the short position. The applicable quoted price for the bond delivered is the product of the conversion factor and the most recent settlement price for the futures contract. Taking accrued interest into account (see Section 6.1), the cash received for each $100 face value of the bond delivered is
1Most recent settlement price*Conversion factor2+Accrued interest
Each contract is for the delivery of $100,000 face value of bonds. Suppose that the most recent settlement price is 120­00, the conversion factor for the bond delivered is 1.3800, and the accrued interest on this bond at the time of delivery is $3 per $100 face value.6.2 TREASURY BOND FUTURES

The cash received by the party with the short position (and paid by the party with the 
long position) is then
11.3800*120.002+3.00=$168.60
per $100 face value. A party with the short position in one contract would deliver bonds with a face value of $100,000 and receive $168,600.
The conversion factor for a bond is set equal to the quoted price the bond would have 
per dollar of principal on the first day of the delivery month on the assumption that the interest rate for all maturities equals 6% per annum (with semiannual compounding). In the case of the first three contracts in Table 6.1, the bond maturity and the times to the coupon payment dates are rounded down to the nearest 3 months for the purposes of the calculation. The practice enables the exchange to produce comprehensive tables. If, after rounding, the bond lasts for an exact number of 6­month periods, the first coupon is assumed to be paid in 6 months. If, after rounding, the bond does not last for an exact number of 6­month periods (i.e., there are an extra 3 months), the first coupon is  
assumed to be paid after 3 months and accrued interest is subtracted.
As a first example of these rules, consider a 10% coupon bond with 20 years and  
2 months to maturity that is deliverable in the T ­bond futures contract. For the purposes 
of calculating the conversion factor, the bond is assumed to have exactly 20 years to maturity. The first coupon payment is assumed to be made after 6 months. Coupon payments are then assumed to be made at 6­month intervals until the end of the 20 years when the principal payment is made. Assume that the face value is $100. When the  
discount rate is 6% per annum with semiannual compounding (or 3% per 6 months), the value of the bond is
a40
i=15
1.03i+100
1.0340=$146.23
Dividing by the face value gives a conversion factor of 1.4623.
As a second example of the rules, consider an 8% coupon bond with 18 years and  
4 months to maturity. For the purposes of calculating the conversion factor, the bond is assumed to have exactly 18 years and 3 months to maturity. Discounting all the payments back to a point in time 3 months from today at 6% per annum (compounded semi­annually) gives a value of
4+a36
i=14
1.03i+100
1.0336=$125.8323
The interest rate for a 3­month period is 21.03-1, or 1.4889%. Hence, discounting 
back to the present gives the bond’s value as 125.8323>1.014889=$123.99. Subtracting 
the accrued interest of 2.0 gives $121.99. The conversion factor is therefore 1.2199.
In the case of the 2­year and 5­year note futures contract, a similar calculation is used 
to determine the conversion factor except that the time to maturity is rounded to the nearest month.
Cheapest-to-Deliver Bond
At any given time during the delivery month, there are many bonds that can be delivered in bond futures contracts. These vary widely as far as coupon and maturity are  
concerned. The party with the short position can choose which of the available bonds 
M06_HULL0654_11_GE_C06.indd   157 12/05/2021   17:21158 CHAPTER 6
is “cheapest” to deliver. Because the party with the short position receives
1Most recent settlement price*Conversion factor2+Accrued interest
and the cost of purchasing a bond is
Quoted bond price+Accrued interest
the cheapest­to­deliver bond is the one for which
Quoted bond price-1Most recent settlement price*Conversion factor2
is least. Once the party with the short position has decided to deliver, it can determine 
the cheapest­to­deliver bond by examining each of the deliverable bonds in turn.
Example 6.1
The party with the short position has decided to deliver and is trying to choose 
between the three bonds in the table below. Assume the most recent settlement price is 93­08, or 93.25.
Bond Quoted bond  
price ($)Conversion  
factor
1 99.50 1.0382
2 143.50 1.5188
3 119.75 1.2615
The cost of delivering each of the bonds is as follows:
Bond 1: 99.50-193.25*1.03822=$2.69
Bond 2: 143.50-193.25*1.51882=$1.87
Bond 3: 119.75-193.25*1.26152=$2.12
The cheapest­to­deliver bond is Bond 2.
A number of factors determine the cheapest­to­deliver bond. When bond yields are in excess of 6%, the conversion factor system tends to favor the delivery of low ­coupon 
long­maturity bonds. When yields are less than 6%, the system tends to favor the  
delivery of high­coupon short­maturity bonds. Also, when the yield curve is upward­ sloping, there is a tendency for bonds with a long time to maturity to be favored,  
whereas when it is downward­sloping, there is a tendency for bonds with a short time to maturity to be delivered.
In addition to the cheapest­to­deliver bond option, the party with a short position 
has an option known as the wild card play. This is described in Business Snapshot 6.2.
Determining the Futures Price
An exact theoretical futures price for the Treasury bond contract is difficult to  
determine because the short party’s options concerned with the timing of delivery  
and choice of the bond that is delivered cannot easily be valued. However, if we assume that both the cheapest­to­deliver bond and the delivery date are known, the Treasury  
M06_HULL0654_11_GE_C06.indd   158 12/05/2021   17:21Interest Rate Futures 159
bond futures contract is a futures contract on a traded security (the bond) that provides 
the holder with known income.1 Equation (5.2) then shows that the futures price, F0, is 
related to the spot price, S0, by
 F0=1S0-I2erT (6.1)
where I is the present value of the coupons during the life of the futures contract, T is 
the time until the futures contract matures, and r is the risk­free interest rate applicable to a time period of length T.
Example 6.2
Suppose that, in a Treasury bond futures contract, it is known that the cheapest­ 
to­deliver bond will be a 12% coupon bond with a conversion factor of 1.6000. Suppose also that it is known that delivery will take place in 270 days. Coupons are payable semiannually on the bond. As illustrated in Figure 6.1, the last coupon date was 60 days ago, the next coupon date is in 122 days, and the coupon date thereafter is in 305 days. The term structure is flat, and the rate of interest (with continuous compounding) is 10% per annum. Assume that the current quoted Business Snapshot 6.2 The Wild Card Play
The settlement price in the CME Group’s Treasury bond futures contract is the price at 2:00 p.m. Chicago time. However, Treasury bonds continue trading in  
the spot market beyond this time and a trader with a short position can issue to  
the clearing house a notice of intention to deliver later in the day. If the notice is issued, the invoice price is calculated on the basis of the settlement price that  
day, that is, the price at 2:00 p.m.
This practice gives rise to an option known as the wild card play. If bond 
prices decline after 2:00 p.m. on the first day of the delivery month, the party with the short position can issue a notice of intention to deliver at, say, 3:45  
p.m. and proceed to buy bonds in the spot market for delivery at a price  
calculated from the 2:00 p.m. futures price. If the bond price does not decline, the party with the short position keeps the position open and waits until the  
next day when the same strategy can be used.
As with the other options open to the party with the short position, the wild 
card play is not free. Its value is reflected in the futures price, which is lower  
than it would be without the option.
1 In practice, for the purposes of estimating the cheapest­to­deliver bond, analysts usually assume that zero 
rates at the maturity of the futures contract will equal today’s forward rates.Figure 6.1 Time chart for Example 6.2.

bond price is $115. The cash price of the bond is obtained by adding to this 
quoted price the proportion of the next coupon payment that accrues to the holder. The cash price is therefore
115+60
60+122*6=116.978
A coupon of $6 will be received after 122 days ( = 0.3342 years). The present value 
of this is
6e-0.1*0.3342=5.803
The futures contract lasts for 270 days ( = 0.7397 years). The cash futures price, if 
the contract were written on the 12% bond, would therefore be
1116.978-5.8032e0.1*0.7397=119.711
At delivery, there are 148 days of accrued interest. The quoted futures price, if the contract were written on the 12% bond, is calculated by subtracting the accrued interest
119.711-6*148
148+35=114.859
From the definition of the conversion factor, 1.6000 standard bonds are considered equivalent to each 12% bond. The quoted futures price should therefore be
114.859
1.6000=71.79
6.3 EURODOLLAR AND SOFR FUTURES
A very popular interest rate futures contract in the United States has historically been the three­month Eurodollar futures contract traded by the CME group. The underlying interest rate is three­month (90­day) U.S. dollar LIBOR and the maturities offered by the CME for this contract extend ten years into the future. Table 6.1 indicates that the volume of trading in Eurodollar futures was still quite high in May 2020. This is a little surprising given that LIBOR is being phased out at the end of 2021 (see Section 4.2). The expectation is that Eurodollar futures will over time be replaced by SOFR futures and this is slowly happening. The volume of trading and open interest for Eurodollar futures has been declining while that for SOFR futures has been increasing. In this section, we explain how both contracts work.
Eurodollar Futures
Eurodollar futures trade until two days before the third Wednesday of the delivery month. At that point, there is a final settlement equal to 
100-R, where R is the three­
month U.S. dollar LIBOR fixing on that day expressed with a quarterly compounding and an actual>360 day count convention. Thus, if three­month LIBOR proved to be 0.75% two days before the third Wednesday of the delivery month, the final settlement price would be 99.250. Once a final settlement has taken place all contracts are  
M06_HULL0654_11_GE_C06.indd   160 12/05/2021   17:21Interest Rate Futures 161
declared closed. Table 6.1 indicates that there is trading in contracts that mature well 
after 2021. As explained in Section 4.2, it may well be that banks will stop providing  
the estimates necessary to determine LIBOR at the end of 2021. If that happens, the 
CME has indicated that it will base the final settlement on SOFR with appropriate adjustments for the spread between the two rates.
The contract is designed so that a one­basis­point 
1= 0.012 move in the futures quote 
corresponds to a gain or loss of $25 per contract. When a Eurodollar futures quote increases by one basis point, a trader who is long one contract gains $25 and a trader who is short one contract loses $25. Similarly, when the quote decreases by one basis point a trader who is long one contract loses $25 and a trader who is short one contract gains $25. Suppose, for example, the settlement price for the September 2020 contract changes from 99.725 to 99.685 between May 21 and May 22, 2020. Traders with long positions lose 
4*25=$100 per contract; traders with short positions gain $100 per 
contract. A one­basis­point change in the futures quote corresponds to a 0.01% change in the underlying interest rate. This in turn leads to a
1,000,000*0.0001*0.25=25
or $25 change in the interest that will be earned on $1 million in three months. The $25 per basis point rule is therefore consistent with the underlying interest rate applying to $1 million of principal.
The futures quote is 100 minus the futures interest rate. A trader who is long gains 
when interest rates fall and one who is short gains when interest rates rise. Table 6.2 shows a possible set of outcomes for the September 2020 contract in Table 6.1 for a trader who takes a long position on May 21, 2020, at the last trade price of 99.720.
The contract in Table 6.2 could be used as a hedge if LIBOR ­based payments were 
due to be received on a principal of $1 million for the three­month period starting on September 14, 2020. The contract locks in a LIBOR rate of 
100-99.720, or 0.28% per 
year. The LIBOR rate on September 14, 2020, in Table 6.2 proves to be 100-99.810, 
or 0.19% per year. The interest received will be 0.25*0.0019*$1,000,000=$475. 
When the $225 gain on the contract is taken into account, the amount received is $700, which corresponds to a LIBOR rate of 0.28% 
10.25*0.0028*$1,000,000=$7002. 
The hedge works well, but it should be noted that it is not perfect. One reason is that

the futures contract is settled daily rather than all at the end. The other is that  
settlement is on September 14, 2020, while interest is paid three months later.2
SOFR Futures
Table 6.1 shows futures quotes for one­month and three­month SOFR futures. The  
one­month SOFR futures contract is designed to be as similar as possible to the federal 
funds rate futures contract. The settlement at the end of a contract month equals 100 minus the arithmetic average of SOFR one­day rates during the month (with rates on a weekend or a holiday being assumed to be the same as the rate on the most recent business day). It can be seen that the May 2020 contract still traded on May 21, 2020, even though the rate on about two thirds of the days in the month had already been observed. The settlement futures rate implied by the May, June, and July futures  
contracts are 0.0475%, 0.055%, and 0.55%, respectively. The rates implied by the  
corresponding federal funds futures contracts are similar. (In theory, they should be slightly higher because the federal funds rate is an unsecured rate while SOFR is secured, but in practice the difference is so small that it is not noticeable in the quotes.)
A one­month SOFR contract is designed to hedge a $5,000,000 position. In this 
respect, it is similar to the federal funds rate contract. When the rate implied by the contract changes by one basis point, the gain or loss per contract is $41.67. (This is  
consistent with the $5,000,000 size because 
$5,000,0000*0.0001*1>12=$41.67.) 
Contracts trade for the 13 months following the current month.
The three­month SOFR futures contract is designed to be as similar as possible to the 
Eurodollar futures contract. The settlement is on the third Wednesday of a month. It equals 100 minus the result of compounding one­day SOFR rates over the previous three months in the way described in Section 4.2. The contract month specified in Table 6.1 is the beginning of the three­month period. The delivery month is three months later. The June 2020 contract was therefore settled on September 16, 2020. The settlement price equaled 
100-R, where R is the rate obtained by compounding the one­day SOFR rates 
observed on days between June 17, 2020, and September 15, 2020. (The rate observed on the final day of the period is not included in the compounding calculation.)
Three­month SOFR futures trade for the contract months of March, June, Septem­
ber, and December. Perhaps optimistically, the CME offers a total of 39 contract  
months so that traders can hedge or speculate on SOFR rates as far in the future as  
10 years. The contract is designed to hedge a $1 million position (similarly to the  
Eurodollar futures contract). When the quote changes by one basis point, the gain or loss per contract is $25. Three­month SOFR futures and Eurodollar futures contracts are therefore structurally very similar. The main difference is that the Eurodollar futures contract is settled at the beginning of the three­month period to which the rate applies whereas the three­moth SOFR futures contract is settled at the end of the three­month period (after all the underlying one­day rates have been observed).
Example 6.3
Suppose that on May 21, 2020, an investor has agreed to pay the three­month 
SOFR rate plus 200 basis points on $100 million of borrowings for three months 
2 One way of approximately allowing for the second point is to discount the principal underlying one  
contract by the futures rate for three months. In the very low interest rate environment on May 21, 2020, this 
would make very little difference. The principal that is hedged by one contract would be assumed to be 
$1,000,000>11+0.25*0.00282=$999,300.
M06_HULL0654_11_GE_C06.indd   162 12/05/2021   17:22Interest Rate Futures 163
beginning on December 16, 2021. From Table 6.1, the December 2021 three­ 
month SOFR futures is 99.990. The futures markets are therefore indicating a SOFR rate of only 0.01% (one basis point) for the period of the borrowings. The investor thinks that rates may increase and so would like to use futures to lock in a borrowing rate of 2.01%. The investor can do this by shorting 100 December contracts. If rates increase, the futures quote will decline and there will be a gain to compensate for the extra interest paid; if rates decrease, the quote will increase and there will be a loss on the futures, but this will be compensated for by less interest being paid.
For example, suppose that the final settlement proves to be 99.200, which  
corresponds to a rate of 0.8% per annum. The rate paid on the loan would then be 2.8% per annum and the total interest would be 
0.25*$100,000,000*0.028 
= $700,000. However, the futures contract has declined by 79 basis points (from 
99.990 to 99.200). The gain is $25 per basis point or 100*$25*79=$197,500 
on 100 contracts. When this is taken into account, the amount paid is 
$700,000-$197,000=$502,500, which corresponds to a rate of 2.01% (that is, 
$502,500=0.25*$100,000,000*0.0201).
On May 21, 2020, negative SOFR rates were considered a possibility. (The 
Federal Reserve Board was taking steps to stimulate the economy by reducing interest rates following the Covid­19 crisis and the interest rates in some other countries were negative.) Suppose that the final settlement is 100.400. The SOFR rate applicable to the borrowings is then 
-0.4% and the investor will pay 
2%-0.4%=1.6%. The interest payment will be 0.25*$100,000,000*0.016 
= $400,000. However, the futures contract has increased by 41 basis points, lead­
ing to a loss of 100*$25*41=$102,250 and bringing the total payment to 
$502,250, as before.
Convexity Adjustments
In Chapter 5 we argued that for most contracts it is not necessary to distinguish between futures and forward prices because the two are very similar. When the futures contracts we have just considered last longer than about two years, it does become important to distinguish between futures and forward. What is termed a convexity adjustment is made so that
Forward Rate=Futures Rate-c
where c is the convexity adjustment.
One reason for the convexity adjustment is daily settlement. Consider two traders. 
Trader A has entered into a futures contract where there will be a gain if rates increase and a loss if rates decrease. (Trader A could be the investor in Example 6.3.) Trader B has entered into a similar forward contract. The contracts are the same except that Trader A ’s contract is settled daily, while Trader B’s contract is settled at the end of its life. The daily settlement will tend to favor Trader A. When rates increase, Trader A makes an immediate gain and, because rates have just increased, the gain will tend to be invested at a relatively high interest rate. When rates decrease, Trader A takes an  
immediate loss but because rates have just decreased this will tend to be financed at  
a relatively low rate. To put this another way, Trader A will tend to have more funds in his or her margin account when rates are high than when rates are low. Trader B, who 
M06_HULL0654_11_GE_C06.indd   163 12/05/2021   17:22164 CHAPTER 6
has entered into an FRA does not benefit from day ­to­day changes in rates in this way. 
To compensate for this, Trader B’s forward quote should be more attractive than 
Trader A ’s futures quote. In this case, a more attractive quote corresponds to a lower forward rate, so that we should expect to see a positive value for the convexity  
adjustment, c.
In the case of Eurodollar futures contracts, there is another consideration. The futures 
contracts are settled at the beginning of the time period to which the rate applies. In an FRA, as explained in Section 4.9, settlement reflects the fact the interest is normally paid at the end of a period rather than the beginning.
3 Consider again Trader A and Trader B 
who will gain if rates increase and lose if rates decrease. When rates prove to be high, the impact of delaying settlement on the value of Trader B’s gain is relatively high. When rates prove to be low, the impact of delaying settlement on Trader B’s loss is relatively low. As a result, the difference in the timing of the settlement favors Trader A and, like daily settlement, leads to forward rates being lower than futures rates.
The convexity adjustment, c , is therefore positive. It increases as the life of the 
contract increases and the volatility of interest rates increase.
4
Calculating Zero Curves
Futures contracts (with the convexity adjustments we have just mentioned being applied as appropriate) can be used to provide estimates of forward interest rates. These can then be used to determine zero rates. From equation (4.5) the forward rate applicable to the period between times 
T1 and T2 is
RF=R2T2-R1T1
T2-T1
where R1 and R2 are the zero rates for maturities T1 and T2, respectively. (All rates are 
assumed be continuously compounded.) It follows from this that
 R2=RF1T2-T12+R1T1
T2 (6.2)
This equation can be used to bootstrap LIBOR or SOFR zero curves.
Consider first LIBOR. Its zero curve is known for maturities up to one year  
(providing banks continue to provide submissions estimating their borrowing rates). 
Equation (6.2) can be used extend this zero curve, as we will now show.
Example 6.4
A 300­day LIBOR zero rate has been calculated (using interpolation between the 
6­month and 12­month rate) as 2.80% with continuous compounding. From  
Eurodollar futures quotes, it has been calculated that (a) the forward rate for a 90­day period beginning in 300 days is 3.30% with continuous compounding,  
3 The settlement in a FRA is usually at the beginning of the time period, but is calculated as the present value 
of what the settlement would be if it were made at the end of the period.
4 Determining c involves an assumption about the underlying interest rate model. See Technical Note 1 at  
www ­2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull/TechnicalNotes for the calculation of convexity adjustments for  
Eurodollar futures and M. P . A. Henrard, Overnight Futures: Convexity Adjustment (February 2018),  
available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3134346, for the calculation of the convexity adjustment for 
SOFR futures.
M06_HULL0654_11_GE_C06.indd   164 12/05/2021   17:22Interest Rate Futures 165
(b) the forward rate for a 90­day period beginning in 391 days is 3.50% with 
continuous compounding, and (c) the forward rate for the 90­day period beginning in 489 days is 3.60% with continuous compounding. We can use equation (6.2) to obtain the 391 rate as
0.033*91+0.028*300
391=0.02916
or 2.916%. Similarly we can use the second forward rate to determine to 489­day rate as
0.035*98+0.02916*391
489=0.03033
or 3.033%. The next forward rate would be used to extend the zero curve for a further three months, and so on. Note that even though the the rate underlying the Eurodollar futures contract is a 90­day rate, it is assumed to apply to the 91 or 98 days between contract maturities to facilitate the bootstrapping.
Determining short­maturity SOFR rates requires a little more work. We illustrate this with another example.
Example 6.5
It is October and the current three­month SOFR futures contract has two months 
until the December delivery date. Suppose further that compounding the over ­
night rates (already observed) for the first month of the contract gives a rate of 2% per year and that the futures quote gives a rate for the whole three­month period of 2.5% per year. If all rates are expressed with continuous compounding, the implied zero rate, R , for the next two months is given by solving
0.02*11>122+R*12>122=0.025*13>122
It is 0.0275, or 2.75%. The forward rate calculated from the contract covering the December to March period can be used in conjunction with this estimate and equation (6.2) to obtain the 5­month zero rate as in Example 6.4. The contract covering the March to June period can similarly determine the 8­month zero rate, and so on.
6.4 DURATION-BASED HEDGING STRATEGIES USING FUTURES
We discussed duration in Section 4.10. Interest rate futures can be used to hedge the yield on a bond portfolio at a future time. Define:
VF : Contract price for one interest rate futures contract
DF :  Duration of the asset underlying the futures contract at the maturity of the 
futures contract
P :  Forward value of the portfolio being hedged at the maturity of the hedge (in practice, this is usually assumed to be the same as the value of the portfolio today)
DP : Duration of the portfolio at the maturity of the hedge.
M06_HULL0654_11_GE_C06.indd   165 12/05/2021   17:22166 CHAPTER 6
If we assume that the change in the forward yield, ∆y, is the same for all maturities, it is  
approximately true that
∆P=-PDP∆y
It is also approximately true that
∆VF=-VFDF∆y
The number of contracts required to hedge against an uncertain ∆y, therefore, is
 N*=PDP
VFDF (6.3)
This is the duration-based hedge ratio. It is sometimes also called the price sensitivity 
hedge ratio.5
When the hedging instrument is a Treasury bond futures contract, the hedger must 
base DF on an assumption that one particular bond will be delivered. This means that 
the hedger must estimate which of the available bonds is likely to be cheapest to deliver at the time the hedge is put in place. If, subsequently, the interest rate environment changes so that it looks as though a different bond will be cheapest to deliver, then the hedge has to be adjusted and as a result its performance may be worse than  anticipated.
When hedges are constructed using interest rate futures, it is important to bear in 
mind that interest rates and futures prices move in opposite directions. When interest rates go up, an interest rate futures price goes down. When interest rates go down, the reverse happens, and the interest rate futures price goes up. Thus, a company in a  
position to lose money if interest rates drop should hedge by taking a long futures  
position. Similarly, a company in a position to lose money if interest rates rise should hedge by taking a short futures position.
The hedger tries to choose the futures contract so that the duration of the underlying 
asset is as close as possible to the duration of the asset being hedged. Eurodollar futures tend to be used for exposures to short­term interest rates, whereas ultra T ­bond,  
Treasury bond, and Treasury note futures contracts are used for exposures to longer ­ 
term rates.
Example 6.6
It is August 2 and a fund manager with $10 million invested in government bonds is 
concerned that interest rates are expected to be highly volatile over the next  
3 months. The fund manager decides to use the December T ­bond futures contract 
to hedge the value of the portfolio. The current futures price is 93­02, or 93.0625. Because each contract is for the delivery of $100,000 face value of bonds, the futures contract price is $93,062.50.
Suppose that the duration of the bond portfolio in 3 months will be  
6.80 years. The cheapest­to­deliver bond in the T ­bond contract is expected to 
be a 20­year 12% per annum coupon bond. The yield on this bond is currently 8.80% per annum, and the duration will be 9.20 years at maturity of the futures contract.
5 For a more detailed discussion of equation (6.5), see R. J. Rendleman, “Duration­Based Hedging with 
Treasury Bond Futures, ” Journal of Fixed Income 9, 1 (June 1999): 84–91.
M06_HULL0654_11_GE_C06.indd   166 12/05/2021   17:22Interest Rate Futures 167
The fund manager requires a short position in T ­bond futures to hedge the 
bond portfolio. If interest rates go up, a gain will be made on the short futures 
position, but a loss will be made on the bond portfolio. If interest rates decrease, a  
loss will be made on the short position, but there will be a gain on the bond portfolio. The number of bond futures contracts that should be shorted can be calculated from equation (6.3) as
10,000,000
93,062.50*6.80
9.20=79.42
To the nearest whole number, the portfolio manager should short 79 contracts.Business Snapshot 6.3 Asset–Liability Management by Banks
The asset–liability management (ALM) committees of banks now monitor their exposure to interest rates very carefully. Matching the durations of assets and  
liabilities is sometimes a first step, but this does not protect a bank against non­ parallel shifts in the yield curve. A popular approach is known as GAP management. This involves dividing the zero­coupon yield curve into segments, known as buckets. The first bucket might be 0 to 1 month, the second 1 to 3 months, and so on. The ALM committee then investigates the effect on the value of the bank’s portfolio of the zero rates corresponding to one bucket changing while those corresponding to all other buckets stay the same.
If there is a mismatch, corrective action is usually taken. This can involve changing 
deposit and lending rates in the way described in Section 4.12. Alternatively, tools such as swaps, FRAs, bond futures, Eurodollar futures, and other interest rate  
derivatives can be used.
6.5 HEDGING PORTFOLIOS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
Financial institutions sometimes attempt to hedge themselves against interest rate risk by ensuring that the average duration of their assets equals the average duration of their liabilities. (The liabilities can be regarded as short positions in bonds.) This strategy is known as duration matching or portfolio immunization. When implemented, it ensures that a small parallel shift in interest rates will have little effect on the value of the  
portfolio of assets and liabilities. The gain (loss) on the assets should offset the loss (gain) on the liabilities.
Duration matching does not immunize a portfolio against nonparallel shifts in the 
zero curve. This is a weakness of the approach. In practice, short­term rates are usually more volatile than, and are not perfectly correlated with, long­term rates. Sometimes it even happens that short­ and long­term rates move in opposite directions to each other. Duration matching is therefore only a first step and financial institutions have developed other tools to help them manage their interest rate exposure. See Business Snapshot 6.3.
M06_HULL0654_11_GE_C06.indd   167 12/05/2021   17:22168 CHAPTER 6
SUMMARY
In the Treasury bond futures contracts, the party with the short position has a number 
of interesting delivery options:
1. Delivery can be made on any day during the delivery month.
2. There are a number of alternative bonds that can be delivered.
3. On any day during the delivery month, the notice of intention to deliver at the  
2:00 p.m. settlement price can be made later in the day.
These options all tend to reduce the futures price.
The Eurodollar futures contract is a contract on the 3­month LIBOR interest rate 
two days before the third Wednesday of the delivery month. It is expected that as LIBOR is phased out this will be replaced by the 3­month SOFR futures contract. This is a futures contract on the rate obtained by compounding one­day SOFR rates over a three­month period.
The concept of duration is important in hedging interest rate risk. It enables a hedger 
to assess the sensitivity of a bond portfolio to small parallel shifts in the yield curve. It also enables the hedger to assess the sensitivity of an interest rate futures price to small changes in the yield curve. The number of futures contracts necessary to protect the bond portfolio against small parallel shifts in the yield curve can therefore be calculated.
The key assumption underlying duration­based hedging is that all interest rates 
change by the same amount. This means that only parallel shifts in the term structure are allowed for. In practice, short­term interest rates are generally more volatile than are long­term interest rates, and hedge performance is liable to be poor if the duration of the bond underlying the futures contract differs markedly from the duration of the asset being hedged.

 6.12.  Suppose that the 300­day LIBOR zero rate is 4% and Eurodollar quotes for contracts 
maturing in 300, 398, and 489 days are 95.83, 95.62, and 95.48. Calculate 398­day and  
489­day LIBOR zero rates. Assume no difference between forward and futures rates for the purposes of your calculations.
 6.13.  Suppose that a bond portfolio with a duration of 12 years is hedged using a futures 
contract in which the underlying asset has a duration of 4 years. What is likely to be the impact on the hedge of the fact that the 12­year rate is less volatile than the 4­year rate?
 6.14.  Suppose that it is February 20 and a treasurer realizes that on July 17 the company will have to issue $5 million of commercial paper with a maturity of 180 days. If the paper  
were issued today, the company would realize $4,820,000. (In other words, the  company 
would receive $4,820,000 for its paper and have to redeem it at $5,000,000 in 180 days’ time.) The September Eurodollar futures price is quoted as 92.00. How should the  
treasurer hedge the company’s exposure?
 6.15.  On August 1, a portfolio manager has a bond portfolio worth $10 million. The duration of the portfolio in October will be 7.1 years. The December Treasury bond futures price is

maturity. How should the portfolio manager immunize the portfolio against changes in interest rates over the next 2 months?
 6.16.  How can the portfolio manager change the duration of the portfolio to 3.0 years in  Problem 6.15?
 6.17. Between October 30, 2022, and November 1, 2022, you have a choice between owning a  
U.S. government bond paying a 12% coupon and a U.S. corporate bond paying a 12% coupon. Consider carefully the day count conventions discussed in this chapter and decide which of the two bonds you would prefer to own. Ignore the risk of default.

 6.20.  It is April 7, 2022. The quoted price of a U.S. government bond with a 6% per annum  
coupon (paid semiannually) is 120­00. The bond matures on July 27, 2033. What is the  
cash price? How does your answer change if it is a corporate bond?
 6.21. It is March 10, 2022. The cheapest­to­deliver bond in a December 2022 Treasury bond  
futures contract is an 8% coupon bond, and delivery is expected to be made on  
December 31, 2022. Coupon payments on the bond are made on March 1 and September 1  
each year. The rate of interest with continuous compounding is 5% per annum for all maturities. The conversion factor for the bond is 1.2191. The current quoted bond price is $137. Calculate the quoted futures price for the contract.
 6.22.  Assume that a bank can borrow or lend money at the same interest rate in the LIBOR market. The 90­day rate is 2% per annum, and the 180­day rate is 2.2% per annum, both expressed with continuous compounding and actual/actual day count. The Eurodollar  
futures price for a contract maturing in 91 days is quoted as 97.95. What arbitrage  
opportunities are open to the bank?

 6.24.  A portfolio manager plans to use a Treasury bond futures contract to hedge a bond portfolio over the next 3 months. The portfolio is worth $100 million and will have a duration of 4.0 years in 3 months. The futures price is 122, and each futures contract is on  
$100,000 of bonds. The bond that is expected to be cheapest to deliver will have a duration of 9.0 years at the maturity of the futures contract. What position in futures contracts is required?
(a) What adjustments to the hedge are necessary if after 1 month the bond that is  
expected to be cheapest to deliver changes to one with a duration of 7 years?
(b) Suppose that all rates increase over the next 3 months, but long­term rates increase 
less than short­term and medium­term rates. What is the effect of this on the  
performance of the hedge?

Swaps
The birth of the over-the-counter swap market can be traced to a currency swap 
negotiated between IBM and the World Bank in 1981. The World Bank had borrowings denominated in U.S. dollars while IBM had borrowings denominated in German deutsche marks and Swiss francs. The World Bank (which was restricted in the deutsche mark and Swiss franc borrowing it could do directly) agreed to make interest payments on IBM’s borrowings while IBM in return agreed to make interest payments on the World Bank’s borrowings. Since that first transaction in 1981, the swap market has seen phenomenal growth.
A swap is an over-the-counter agreement between two companies to exchange cash 
flows in the future. The agreement defines the dates when the cash flows are to be paid and the way in which they are to be calculated. Usually the calculation of the cash flows involves the future value of an interest rate, an exchange rate, or other market variable.
A forward contract can be viewed as a simple example of a swap. Suppose it is 
March 1, 2022, and a company enters into a forward contract to buy 100 ounces of gold for $1,700 per ounce in one year. The company can sell the gold in one year as soon as it is received. The forward contract is therefore equivalent to a swap where the company agrees that on March 1, 2023, it will pay $170,000 and receive 100S, where S is the market price of one ounce of gold on that date.
Whereas a forward contract is equivalent to the exchange of cash flows on just one 
future date, swaps typically lead to cash-flow exchanges taking place on several future dates. In this chapter we examine how swaps are used and how they are valued. Our discussion centers on interest rate swaps and currency swaps. Other types of swaps are briefly reviewed at the end of this chapter and discussed in more detail in Chapter 34.7 CHAPTER  
An interest rate swap is a swap where interest at a predetermined fixed rate, applied to a  
certain principal, is exchanged for interest at a floating reference rate, applied to the same principal, with regular exchanges being made for an agreed period of time. Historically, the most common floating reference interest rate in an interest rate swap 7.1 MECHANICS OF INTEREST RATE SWAPS
M07_HULL0654_11_GE_C07.indd   172 30/04/2021   16:47Swaps 173
has been LIBOR. For example, a swap negotiated in the past might be an agreement to 
exchange interest at 2% on a principal of $50 million for interest at three-month LIBOR on the same principal for the next five years with exchanges every three months.
As explained in Chapter 4, LIBOR has proved to be an unsatisfactory reference rate 
because it is based on estimates made by banks, not on actual transactions. The plan in financial markets is to phase out the use of LIBOR and replace it by a reference rate based on overnight transactions between banks. The transition period will be tricky for the swaps market. Many LIBOR-for-fixed swaps have been negotiated in the past with long lives and will continue to be in existence after the use of LIBOR has been  discontinued. 
For example, a 20-year swap negotiated at the end of 2013 will still have 12 years to run at the end of 2021 (which was the original date chosen for the end of LIBOR). If banks stop providing LIBOR estimates after the end of 2021, it will be necessary for the market to agree on a way of estimating LIBOR from the new reference rates. For example, three-month U.S. LIBOR is likely to be estimated as three-month SOFR plus x , where x  is some 
average of the difference between the two rates observed in the past.
At this point, it is worth reviewing the differences between LIBOR and the overnight 
reference rates that are replacing it:
• LIBOR rates are the borrowing rates estimated by banks in the interbank market for periods between one day and one year.
• Overnight rates such as SOFR and SONIA are based on actual transactions 
between banks.
• The overnight rates are converted to longer reference rates using what might be termed an “averaging process. ” Usually the averaging involves daily compounding as described in Section 4.2, but occasionally a simple arithmetic average is used (as for CME’s one-month SOFR futures).
• LIBOR rates for a period are known at the beginning of the period to which they apply, whereas the result of the averaging process for overnight rates is known only at the end of the period.
• LIBOR rates incorporate some credit risk, whereas rates based on overnight rates 
such as SOFR and SONIA are considered to be risk-free rates.
As LIBOR is phased out, swaps based on overnight rates are becoming more popular. These are referred to as overnight indexed swaps (OISs).
An OIS is an agreement to exchange a fixed rate of interest for a reference rate of 
interest that is calculated from realized overnight rates. A simple example of an OIS is a swap lasting for three months. This leads to a single exchange at the end of the three months. The fixed rate of interest applied to a certain principal is exchanged for the reference rate applied to the same principal. Other similar OISs that last for one month, six months, and one year lead to a single exchange calculated in a similar way. When the life of the OIS is greater than one year, it is typically divided into three-month  subperiods, with the fixed rate being exchanged at the end of each three-month period 
for the three-month reference rate that is calculated for that period from one-day rates. OISs lasting ten years or longer are now traded.
Consider a hypothetical two-year OIS initiated on March 8, 2022, between Apple and 
Citigroup. We suppose Apple agrees to pay to Citigroup interest at the rate of 3% per annum every three months on a notional principal of $100 million, and in return  
Citgroup agrees to pay Apple the three-month SOFR floating reference rate on the

same notional principal. Apple is the fixed-rate payer; Citigroup is the floating-rate 
payer. For ease of exposition, we assume that rates are quoted with quarterly com-pounding and we ignore the impact of day count conventions and holiday conventions (which are explained later in this chapter). The swap is shown in Figure 7.1.
In total there are eight exchanges on the swap. One possible outcome is shown in 
Table 7.1. The first exchange of payments would take place on June 8, 2022. Apple  
would pay Citigroup $750,000 (one quarter of 3% applied to $100 million). Citigroup would pay Apple the three-month rate calculated from daily SOFR rates over the  
previous three months. The 3-month SOFR rate calculated on June 8, 2022 (from  
overnight rates between March 8, 2022, and June 8, 2022) is assumed to be 2.2% per annum or 0.55% per three months using the formula in Section 4.2. The floating  
payment from Citigroup to Apple is therefore $550,000. The fixed and floating pay -
ments are netted with the result that Apple pays Citigroup $200,000 on June 8, 2022. The second exchange of payments is on September 8, 2022. Again, the fixed payment from Apple to Citigroup is $750,000. We assume that the 3-month SOFR rate on  
September 8, 2022 (calculated from overnight rates between June 8, 2022 and Septem-ber 8, 2022) is 2.6% per annum or 0.65% per three months. The floating payment is therefore $650,000 and the net payment from Apple to Citigroup is therefore $100,000.
What is the difference between an OIS and a LIBOR swap? If the heading of the 
second column in Table 7.1 is changed to “LIBOR rate” the table could provide an example of a LIBOR swap. The difference is that the LIBOR rate for a period is known at the beginning of the period, whereas the overnight reference rate is not known until the end of the period. The 2.20% floating rate applicable to the first exchange on June 8, 2002, if LIBOR, would be known at the beginning of the swap’s life on March 8, 2022; the 2.60% floating rate applicable to the second exchange on September 8, 2022, would be known on June 8, 2022; and so on.
M07_HULL0654_11_GE_C07.indd   174 30/04/2021   16:48Swaps 175
Overnight indexed swaps play an important role in determining the risk-free rates which 
are needed for valuing derivatives.1
OISs, when first entered into, into have a value of zero. (In this respect an OIS is like 
a forward contract.) The fixed rate that is exchanged for floating is referred to as the OIS rate. The OIS rates for a range of maturities can be observed in the market at a particular time. OIS rates with maturities one year or less, because they lead to just one exchange, have a straightforward interpretation. They provide the risk-free zero rates that are equivalent to the underlying overnight rates.
Now consider OIS rates for maturities greater than a year. The notional principal is 
not exchanged in an OIS. (This is why the principal is termed “notional. ”) However, if we did exchange the notional principal at the end of the life of the swap, the cash exchanges would not change in any way because the notional principal is the same for both the fixed and floating payments. Table 7.2 is produced from Table 7.1 by adding exchanges of principal at the end. The table shows that the swap is equivalent to the exchange of a floating rate bond (cash flows in the third column) for a fixed rate bond (cash flows in the fourth column).
A key point is that the floating-rate bond in Table 7.2 is worth $100,000. This is 
because it provides the payments necessary to service $100 million of borrowings at overnight rates. (To see this, imagine that (a) $100 million plus accumulated interest is borrowed at successive overnight rates during each quarter, (b) the accumulated interest is paid at the end of each quarter, and (c) $100 million principal is repaid at the end of the two years.) Because an OIS is worth zero when first entered into, the fixed-rate bond (fourth column of Table 7.2) must also be worth $100 million. This shows that the OIS rate of 3% is the interest rate on a two-year fixed-rate bond that is worth par and pays interest quarterly.
OIS rates can therefore be used in the same way as the Treasury rates in Section 4.7 to 
define a zero curve. The OIS rates out to one year define zero rates in a direct way. The OIS rates for longer maturities define bonds worth par. The zero curve can be assumed 7.2 DETERMINING RISK-FREE RATES

than Treasury rates.

Swaps have proved to be very popular because they have many uses, as we will now explain. Most of the discussion of interest rate swaps in the next few sections applies regardless of the floating reference rate used. For ease of exposition we will therefore simply refer to the floating rate as “floating. ”
Using the Swap to Transform a Liability
For Apple, the swap in Figure 7.1 could be used to transform a floating-rate loan into a 
fixed-rate loan, as indicated in Figure 7.3. Suppose that Apple has arranged to borrow $100 million for two years at the floating rate plus 10 basis points. (One basis point is 7.3 REASONS FOR TRADING INTEREST RATE SWAPSto be linear between maturities and calculations can be carried out by DerivaGem. A example of the result of the calculations is shown in Table 7.3 and Figure 7.2. In this example, the two-year and five-year zero rates would be chosen using an iterative search procedure (such as Solver in Excel) so that they are consistent with the following:
• A two-year bond making quarterly interest payments at 3% per annum is worth par.
• A five-year bond making quarterly interest payments at 4% per annum is worth par.

0.01%, so the rate is floating plus 0.1%.) After Apple has entered into the swap, it has 
three sets of cash flows:
1. It pays floating plus 0.1% to its outside lenders.
2. It receives floating under the terms of the swap.
3. It pays 3% under the terms of the swap.
These three sets of cash flows net out to an interest rate payment of 3.1%. Thus, for Apple the swap could have the effect of transforming borrowings at the floating rate plus 10 basis points into borrowings at a fixed rate of 3.1%.
A company wishing to transform a fixed-rate loan into a floating-rate loan would 
enter into the opposite swap. Suppose that Intel has borrowed $100 million at 3.2% for two years and wishes to switch to the floating rate. Like Apple, it contacts Citigroup. We assume that it agrees to enter into a swap where it pays the floating rate and receives 2.97%. Its position would then be as indicated Figure 7.4. It has three sets of cash flows:
1. It pays 3.2% to its outside lenders.
2. It pays floating under the terms of the swap.
3. It receives 2.97% under the terms of the swap.
These three sets of cash flows net out to an interest rate payment of floating plus 0.23% (or floating plus 23 basis points). Thus, for Intel the swap could have the effect of transforming borrowings at a fixed rate of 3.2% into borrowings at the floating rate plus 23 basis points.
Using the Swap to Transform an Asset
Swaps can also be used to transform the nature of an asset. Consider Apple in our example. The swap in Figure 7.1 could have the effect of transforming an asset earning 
a fixed rate of interest into an asset earning a floating rate of interest. Suppose that Apple owns $100 million in bonds that will provide interest at 2.7% per annum over the Figure 7.3 Apple uses the swap in Figure 7.1 to convert floating-rate  
borrowings into fixed-rate borrowings.

next two years. After Apple has entered into the swap, it is in the position shown in 
Figure 7.5. It has three sets of cash flows:
1. It receives 2.7% on the bonds.
2. It receives floating under the terms of the swap.
3. It pays 3% under the terms of the swap.
These three sets of cash flows net out to an interest rate inflow of floating minus 30 basis points. The swap has therefore transformed an asset earning 2.7% into an asset earning floating minus 30 basis points.
Consider next the swap entered into by Intel in Figure 7.4. The swap could have the 
effect of transforming an asset earning a floating rate of interest into an asset earning a fixed rate of interest. Suppose that Intel has an investment of $100 million that yields floating minus 20 basis points. After it has entered into the swap, it is in the position shown in Figure 7.6. It has three sets of cash flows:
1. It receives floating minus 20 basis points on its investment.
2. It pays floating under the terms of the swap.
3. It receives 2.97% under the terms of the swap.
These three sets of cash flows net out to an interest rate inflow of 2.77%. Thus, one possible use of the swap for Intel is to transform an asset earning floating minus 20 basis points into an asset earning 2.77%.Figure 7.5 Apple uses the swap in Figure 7.1 to convert a fixed-rate  
investment into a floating-rate investment.

Financial institutions such as Citigroup act as market makers and provide bid and ask quotes for the fixed rates that they are prepared to exchange in swaps. Table 7.4 shows the full set of quotes that might be made at the time of the trades considered in Figures 7.3 to 7.6. The bid quote is the fixed rate that applies when the financial 7.4 THE ORGANIZATION OF TRADING

institution is paying the fixed rate and receiving floating. The ask quote is the fixed rate 
that applies when it is receiving the fixed rate and paying floating. The average of the bid and ask rates is known as the swap rate and is shown in the final column. The spread between the bid and the ask (three to four basis points in the table) compensates the market maker for its costs.
Occasionally a market maker may be lucky enough to enter into offsetting trades 
with two different nonfinancial companies. Usually, however, when it enters into a trade with a nonfinancial company, it must enter into the opposite trade with another  
financial institution to hedge its risk. This is less profitable. Also, as explained in earlier chapters, the financial crisis of 2008 led to an international agreement that standard swaps between financial institutions be traded on electronic platforms and cleared though central counterparties (CCPs). This agreement would not apply to the swap  
in Figures 7.4 and 7.6 because Intel is a nonfinancial company, but it would apply to Citigroup’s hedging trade with another financial institution. Whereas the trade with Intel might require no collateral to be posted, the hedging trade with another financial institution would require both initial and variation margin because it would be cleared through a CCP . This point is discussed further in Chapter 9.
Day Count Issues
We discussed day count conventions in Section 6.1. The day count conventions affect payments on a swap and mean that some of the numbers calculated in the examples we have given earlier in this chapter are only approximately correct. Floating reference rates such as SOFR and U.S. LIBOR are quoted on an actual> 360 basis. The first  
floating payment in Table 7.1 is based on a rate of 2.2%. Because there are 92 days between March 8, 2022, and June 8, 2022, the floating payment that reflects an actual> 360 day count is
$100,000,000*0.022*92
360=$562,222
In general, it is LRn>360 where L is the principal, R is the floating rate, and n is the 
number of days in the accrual period.
The fixed rate in a swap is also quoted with a day count convention. Popular fixed-
rate day counts are actual>365 and 30>360. This means that the fixed and floating rates are often not directly comparable because one applies to 360 days while the other applies to a full year. Also, in the case of actual>365, the fixed-rate cash flows in a swap will vary slightly according to the number of days in the applicable period.Maturity (years) Bid Ask Swap rate

Confirmations
When swaps are traded bilaterally a legal agreement, known as a confirmation, is signed by representatives of the two parties. The drafting of confirmations has been facilitated by the work of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) in New York. This organization has produced a number of Master Agreements that are  
designed to cover all over-the-counter derivative transactions between two parties and define what happens in the event of default by either side, collateral requirements (if any), and so on. Business Snapshot 7.1 shows a possible extract from the confirmation for the swap between Apple and the Citigroup in Figure 7.1. Almost certainly, the full confirmation would state that the provisions of an ISDA Master Agreement apply to the contract.
The confirmation specifies that the following business day convention is to be used 
and that the U.S. calendar determines which days are business days and which days are holidays. This means that, if a payment date falls on a weekend or a U.S. holiday, the payment is made on the next business day.

2 Another business day convention that is sometimes specified is the modified following business day 
 convention, which is the same as the following business day convention except that when the next business 
day falls in a different month from the specified day, the payment is made on the immediately preceding business day. Preceding and modified preceding business day conventions are defined analogously.

AAACorp 4.0% Floating -0.1%
BBBCorp 5.2% Floating +0.6%Table 7.5 Borrowing rates that provide a basis for the comparative-advantage 
argument. “Floating” is the floating reference rate.An explanation commonly put forward to explain the popularity of swaps concerns 
comparative advantages. In this context, a comparative advantage is advantage that leads to company being treated more favorably in one debt market than in another debt market. Consider the use of an interest rate swap to transform a liability. Some companies, it is argued, have a comparative advantage when borrowing in fixed-rate markets, whereas other companies have a comparative advantage when borrowing in floating-rate markets. To obtain a new loan, it makes sense for a company to go to the market where it has a comparative advantage. As a result, the company may borrow fixed when it wants floating, or borrow floating when it wants fixed. The swap is used to transform a fixed-rate loan into a floating-rate loan, and vice versa.
Illustration
Suppose that two companies, AAACorp and BBBCorp, both wish to borrow $10 million for five years and have been offered the rates shown in Table 7.5. AAACorp has a AAA credit rating; BBBCorp has a BBB credit rating.
3 We assume that BBBCorp wants to 
borrow at a fixed rate of interest, whereas AAACorp wants to borrow at a floating rate. Since BBBCorp has a worse credit rating than AAACorp, it pays a higher rate of interest in both fixed and floating markets.
A key feature of the rates offered to AAACorp and BBBCorp is that the difference 
between the two fixed rates is greater than that between the two floating rates. BBBCorp pays 1.2% more than AAACorp in fixed-rate markets and only 0.7% more than AAACorp in floating-rate markets. BBBCorp appears to have a comparative advantage in floating-rate markets, whereas AAACorp appears to have a comparative advantage in fixed-rate markets.
4 It is this apparent anomaly that can lead to a swap being  negotiated. 
AAACorp borrows fixed-rate funds at 4% per annum. BBBCorp borrows funds at 
floating plus 0.6% per annum. They then enter into a swap agreement to ensure that AAACorp ends up with floating-rate funds and BBBCorp with fixed-rate funds.
To understand how the swap might work, we first assume (somewhat unrealistically) 
that AAACorp and BBBCorp get in touch with each other directly. The sort of swap 7.5 THE COMPARATIVE-ADVANTAGE ARGUMENT
4 Note that BBBCorp’s comparative advantage in floating-rate markets does not imply that BBBCorp pays 
less than AAACorp in this market. It means that the extra amount that BBBCorp pays over the amount paid 
by AAACorp is less in this market. One of my students summarized the situation as follows: “ AAACorp pays more less in fixed-rate markets; BBBCorp pays less more in floating-rate markets. ”3 The credit ratings assigned to companies by S&P and Fitch (in order of decreasing creditworthiness) are 
AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, B, and CCC. The corresponding ratings assigned by Moody’s are Aaa, Aa, A, Baa, Ba, B, and Caa, respectively.
M07_HULL0654_11_GE_C07.indd   181 30/04/2021   16:48182 CHAPTER 7
they might negotiate is shown in Figure 7.7. AAACorp agrees to pay BBBCorp interest 
at a floating reference rate on $10 million. In return, BBBCorp agrees to pay AAACorp interest at a fixed rate of 4.35% per annum on $10 million.
AAACorp has three sets of interest rate cash flows:
1. It pays 4% per annum to outside lenders.
2. It receives 4.35% per annum from BBBCorp.
3. It pays floating to BBBCorp.
The net effect of the three cash flows is that AAACorp pays floating minus 0.35% per annum. This is 0.25% per annum less than it would pay if it went directly to floating- rate markets.
BBBCorp also has three sets of interest rate cash flows:
1. It pays floating
+0.6% per annum to outside lenders.
2. It receives floating from AAACorp.
3. It pays 4.35% per annum to AAACorp.
The net effect of the three cash flows is that BBBCorp pays 4.95% per annum. This is 0.25% per annum less than it would pay if it went directly to fixed-rate markets.
In this example, the swap has been structured so that the net gain to both sides is the 
same, 0.25%. This need not be the case. However, the total apparent gain from this  
type of interest rate swap arrangement is always 
a-b, where a is the difference between 
the interest rates facing the two companies in fixed-rate markets, and b is the difference between the interest rates facing the two companies in floating-rate markets. In this case, 
a=1.2% and b=0.7%, so that the total gain is 0.5%.
If the transaction between AAACorp and BBBCorp were brokered by a financial 
institution, an arrangement such as that shown in Figure 7.8 might result. In this case, AAACorp ends up borrowing at 
floating-0.33%, BBBCorp ends up borrowing at 
4.97%, and the financial institution earns a spread of four basis points per year. The  
gain to AAACorp is 0.23%; the gain to BBBCorp is 0.23%; and the gain to the  
financial institution is 0.04%. The total gain to all three parties is 0.5% as before.Figure 7.7 Swap agreement between AAACorp and BBBCorp when rates

Criticism of the Comparative-Advantage Argument
The comparative-advantage argument we have just outlined for explaining the attractive-
ness of interest rate swaps is open to question. Why in Table 7.5 should the spreads between the rates offered to AAACorp and BBBCorp be different in fixed and floating markets? Now that the interest rate swap market has been in existence for a long time, we might reasonably expect these types of differences to have been arbitraged away.
The reason that spread differentials appear to exist is due to the nature of the 
contracts available to companies in fixed and floating markets. Suppose that the  
floating reference rate is a three-month rate. The 4.0% and 5.2% rates available to AAACorp and BBBCorp in fixed-rate markets are five-year rates (for example, the rates  
at which the companies can issue five-year fixed-rate bonds). The rates offered in floating-rate markets are three-month rates. In the floating-rate market, the lender usually has the opportunity to review the spread above the floating reference rate every time rates are reset. (In our example, rates are reset quarterly.) If the creditworthiness of AAACorp or BBBCorp has declined, the lender has the option of increasing the spread over the floating reference rate that is charged. In extreme circumstances, the lender can refuse to continue the loan. The providers of fixed-rate financing do not have the option  
to change the terms of the loan in this way.
5
The spreads between the rates offered to AAACorp and BBBCorp are a reflection of 
the extent to which BBBCorp is more likely to default than AAACorp. During the next three months, there is very little chance that either AAACorp or BBBCorp will default. As we look further ahead, default statistics show that on average the probability of a default by a company with a BBB credit rating increases faster than the probability of a default by a company with a AAA credit rating. This is why the spread between the  
five-year rates is greater than the spread between the three-month floating rates.
After negotiating a loan at 
floating+0.6% and entering into the swap shown in  
Figure 7.8, BBBCorp appears to obtain a fixed-rate loan at 4.97%. The arguments just 
presented show that this is not really the case. In practice, the rate paid is 4.97% only if BBBCorp can continue to borrow floating-rate funds at a spread of 0.6% over the floating reference rate. If, for example, the credit rating of BBBCorp declines so that the  
floating-rate loan is rolled over at 
floating+1.6%, the rate paid by BBBCorp increases 
to 5.97%. The market expects that BBBCorp’s spread over the floating reference rate will on average rise during the swap’s life. BBBCorp’s expected average borrowing rate when it enters into the swap is therefore greater than 4.97%.
The swap in Figure 7.8 locks in 0.33% below the floating reference rate for AAACorp 
for the next five years, not just for the next three months. This appears to be a good deal for AAACorp. The downside is that unless collateral is posted it is bearing the risk of a default by the financial institution. If it borrowed floating-rate funds in the usual way, it would not be bearing this risk.
5 If the floating-rate loans are structured so that the spread over the reference rate is guaranteed in advance 
regardless of changes in credit rating, there is in practice little or no comparative advantage.We now move on to discuss the valuation of interest rate swaps. An interest rate swap is worth close to zero when it is first initiated. After it has been in existence for some time, its value may be positive or negative.7.6 VALUATION OF INTEREST RATE SWAPS
M07_HULL0654_11_GE_C07.indd   183 30/04/2021   16:48184 CHAPTER 7
Each exchange of payment in a swap can be regarded as a forward rate agreement 
(FRA). As shown at the end of Section 4.9, an FRA can be valued by assuming that 
forward rates are realized. Because it is nothing more than a portfolio of FRAs, an interest rate swap can also be valued by assuming that forward rates are realized. The procedure is:
1. Calculate forward rates for each of the unknown floating rates that will determine swap cash flows.
2. Calculate the swap cash flows on the assumption that unknown floating rates will 
equal forward rates.
3. Discount the swap cash flows at the risk-free rate.
The value of a swap therefore requires a calculation of forward rates corresponding to 
all floating payments and risk-free rates to discount the net cash flows from payments dates to the present. We explained how to calculate a risk-free zero curve from OIS rates earlier in the chapter. This provides the necessary risk-free rates. Furthermore, if the swap is an OIS, the relevant forward rates can be calculated from this risk-free zero curve using the formulas in Section 4.8. Note that the first rate required is not really a forward rate. It is a blend of one-day rates already observed and the zero rate that  corresponds to the remaining one-day rates in the period.
In the case of a LIBOR swap, the necessary forward rates are estimated from 
 Eurodollar futures and swap rates (assuming these are available). Eurodollar futures 
provide a direct estimate of forward rates (although a convexity adjustment might be necessary as discussed in Chapter 6). In the case of swap rates, we use that fact that  
swap rates such as those in Table 7.4 define swaps that are worth zero. This provides equations that must be satisfied by forward rates. With appropriate interpolation a  complete forward curve consistent with the swaps rates can be obtained. Note that the 
first LIBOR payment has generally already been determined and does not require a forward rate calculation.
Example 7.1
Suppose that some time ago a financial institution entered into a swap where it 
agreed to make semiannual payments at a rate of 3% per annum and receive the SOFR six-month reference rate on a notional principal of $100 million. The swap now has a remaining life of 1.2 years. Payments will therefore be exchanged at 0.2,  
0.7, and 1.2 years. Assume the risk-free rates with continuous compounding  
(calculated from SOFR) for 0.2, 0.7, and 1.2 years are 2.8%, 3.2%, and 3.4%,  
respectively. Assume also that the continuously compounded risk-free rate ob-served for the last 0.3 years (which contain 60% of the days that will determine  
the exchange at 0.2 years) is 2.3%. The floating rate for the exchange at 0.2 years is  
assumed to be 
0.6*2.3%+0.4*2.8%, or 2.50%. The floating rate for exchange 
at 0.7 years is the forward rate for the period between 0.2 and 0.7 years. This is 3.36% with continuous compounding. Similarly, the floating rate for the exchange at 1.2 years is the forward rate for the period between 0.7 years and 1.2 years. This is 3.68% with continuous compounding.
The swap is therefore valued assuming that the three floating rates are 2.50%, 
3.36%, and 3.68% with continuous compounding. With semiannual compound-ing, these rates become 2.516%, 3.388%, and 3.714%. The calculations for valuing 
M07_HULL0654_11_GE_C07.indd   184 30/04/2021   16:48Swaps 185
the swap are therefore as indicated in the following table (all cash flows are in 
millions of dollars):

1.2 -1.500 +1.857 +0.357 0.9600 +0.343
Total +0.292
Consider, for example, the 0.7 year row. The fixed cash flow is -0.5*0.03*100, 
or -$1.500 million. The floating cash flow, assuming forward rates are realized, is  
0.5*0.03388*100, or $1.694 million. The net cash flow is therefore $0.194 mil-
lion. The discount factor is e-0.032*0.7=0.9778, so that the present value is 
$0.194*0.9778=$0.190.
The value of the swap is obtained by summing the present values. It is  
$0.292 million. (Note that these calculations are approximate because they do not take account of holiday calendars and day count conventions.)
The fixed rate in an interest rate swap is chosen so that the swap is worth zero initially. This does not mean that each cash flow exchange in the swap is worth zero initially. Instead, it means that the sum of the values of the cash flow exchanges is zero. Figure 7.9 shows two alternative situations in swap where there are ten cash-flow exchanges.
Figure 7.9a would arise in the situation where the term structure of interest rates is 
upward sloping and a fixed rate of interest is being received while the floating rate is paid. The upward-sloping term structure produces forward rates that increase with maturity. As a result the value of the exchanges decreases with maturity. Because the sum of the exchanges is zero, it follows that the early exchanges must have a positive value while the later ones have a negative value. If the term structure of rates is upward sloping and the fixed rate is being paid while the floating rate is received, a similar argument shows that the early exchanges will have a negative value while the later exchanges have a positive value. This is the situation in Figure 7.9b. When the term structure is downward sloping, the position is reversed, so that Figure 7.9a shows 
the situation where the fixed rate is paid and Figure 7.9b where the fixed rate is received.
These results can be used to determine whether the swap is expected to have a 
 positive or negative value in the future. In Figure 7.9a the value of the swap is expected 
to become negative with the passage of time because the early positive-value exchanges 
will have been made. Similarly, in Figure 7.9b the value of the swap is expected to become positive with the passage of time because the early negative-value exchanges will have been made.
67.7 HOW THE VALUE CHANGES THROUGH TIME
6 Expected values are those that are expected to happen on average, not what is certain to happen. For 
example, if interest rates decline unexpectedly, the swap in Figure 7.9a could have a positive value for the 
whole of its life.

Another popular type of swap is a fixed-for-fixed currency swap. This involves exchang-
ing principal and interest payments at a fixed rate in one currency for principal and interest payments at a fixed rate in another currency.
A currency swap agreement requires the principal to be specified in each of the two 
currencies. The principal amounts in each currency are usually exchanged at the  beginning and at the end of the life of the swap. Usually the principal amounts are 
chosen to be approximately equivalent using the exchange rate at the swap’s initiation. But when they are exchanged at the end of the life of the swap, their values may be quite different.
Illustration
Consider a hypothetical five-year currency swap agreement between British Petroleum and Barclays entered into on February 1, 2022. We suppose that British Petroleum pays  
a fixed rate of interest of 3% in dollars to Barclays and receives a fixed rate of interest of 7.8 FIXED-FOR-FIXED CURRENCY SWAPS
M07_HULL0654_11_GE_C07.indd   186 30/04/2021   16:48Swaps 187
4% in British pounds (sterling) from Barclays. Interest rate payments are made once a 
year and the principal amounts are $15 million and £10 million. This is termed a fixed-  
for-fixed currency swap because the interest rate in both currencies is fixed. The swap is shown in Figure 7.10. Initially, the principal amounts flow in the opposite direction to  
the arrows in Figure 7.10. The interest payments during the life of the swap and the final principal payment flow in the same direction as the arrows. Thus, at the outset of the  
swap, British Petroleum pays £10 million and receives $15 million. Each year during the life of the swap contract, British Petroleum receives £0.40 million (
= 4% of £10 million) 
and pays $0.45 million ( = 3% of $15 million). At the end of the life of the swap, it pays 
$15 million and receives £10 million. These cash flows are shown in Table 7.6. The cash flows to Barclays are the opposite to those shown.
Use of a Currency Swap to Transform Liabilities  
and Assets
A swap such as the one just considered can be used to transform borrowings in one currency to borrowings in another currency. Suppose that British Petroleum can borrow £10 million at 4% interest. The swap has the effect of transforming this loan into one where it has borrowed $15 million at 3% interest. The initial exchange of principal converts the amount borrowed from sterling to dollars. The subsequent exchanges in the swap have the effect of swapping the interest and principal payments from sterling to dollars.
The swap can also be used to transform the nature of assets. Suppose that British 
Petroleum can invest $15 million to earn 3% in U.S. dollars for the next five years, but feels that sterling will strengthen (or at least not depreciate) against the dollar and prefers a U.K.-denominated investment. The swap has the effect of transforming the U.S. investment into a £10 million investment in the U.K. yielding 4%.

Comparative Advantage
Currency swaps can be motivated by comparative advantage. To illustrate this, we 
 consider another hypothetical example. Suppose the five-year fixed-rate borrowing costs 
to General Electric and Qantas Airways in U.S. dollars (USD) and Australian dollars (AUD) are as shown in Table 7.7. The data in the table suggest that Australian rates are higher than U.S. interest rates. Also, General Electric is more creditworthy than Qantas Airways, because it is offered a more favorable rate of interest in both currencies. From the viewpoint of a swap trader, the interesting aspect of Table 7.7 is that the spreads between the rates paid by General Electric and Qantas Airways in the two markets are not the same. Qantas Airways pays 2% more than General Electric in the USD market and only 0.4% more than General Electric in the AUD market.
This situation is analogous to that in Table 7.5. General Electric has a comparative 
advantage in the USD market, whereas Qantas Airways has a comparative advantage in the AUD market. In Table 7.5, where a plain vanilla interest rate swap was  
considered, we argued that comparative advantages are largely illusory. Here we are comparing the rates offered in two different currencies, and it is more likely that the comparative advantages are genuine. One possible source of comparative advantage is tax. General Electric’s position might be such that USD borrowings lead to lower taxes on its worldwide income than AUD borrowings. Qantas Airways’ position might be the reverse. (Note that we assume that the interest rates in Table 7.7 have been adjusted to reflect these types of tax advantages.)
We suppose that General Electric wants to borrow 20 million AUD and Qantas 
Airways wants to borrow 15 million USD and that the current exchange rate (USD per AUD) is 0.7500. This creates a perfect situation for a currency swap. General Electric and Qantas Airways each borrow in the market where they have a comparative  advantage; that is, General Electric borrows USD whereas Qantas Airways borrows 
AUD. They then use a currency swap to transform General Electric’s loan into a AUD loan and Qantas Airways’ loan into a USD loan.
As already mentioned, the difference between the dollar interest rates is 2%, whereas 
the difference between the AUD interest rates is 0.4%. By analogy with the interest rate swap case, we expect the total gain to all parties to be 
2.0-0.4=1.6% per annum.
There are many ways in which the swap can be arranged. Figure 7.11 shows one 
way a swap might be brokered by a financial institution. General Electric borrows USD and Qantas Airways borrows AUD. The effect of the swap is to transform the USD interest rate of 5% per annum to an AUD interest rate of 6.9% per annum for General Electric. As a result, General Electric is 0.7% per annum better off than it would be if it went directly to AUD markets. Similarly, Qantas exchanges an AUD loan at 8% per annum for a USD loan at 6.3% per annum and ends up 0.7% per 
USD*AUD*
General Electric 5.0% 7.6%
Qantas Airways 7.0% 8.0%

position to hedge the risk.Figure 7.11 A currency swap motivated by comparative advantage.

annum better off than it would be if it went directly to USD markets. The financial 
institution gains 1.3% per annum on its USD cash flows and loses 1.1% per annum on its AUD flows. If we ignore the difference between the two currencies, the financial institution makes a net gain of 0.2% per annum. As predicted, the total gain to all parties is 1.6% per annum.
Each year the financial institution makes a gain of USD 195,000 (
= 1.3% of  
15 million) and incurs a loss of AUD 220,000 ( = 1.1% of 20 million). The financial 
institution can avoid any foreign exchange risk by buying AUD 220,000 per annum in the forward market for each year of the life of the swap, thus locking in a net gain  
in USD.
It is possible to redesign the swap so that the financial institution does not need to 
hedge. Figures 7.12 and 7.13 present two alternatives. These alternatives are unlikely to be used in practice because they do not lead to General Electric and Qantas being free of foreign exchange risk.
7 In Figure 7.12, Qantas bears some foreign exchange risk because 
it pays 1.1% per annum in AUD and pays 5.2% per annum in USD. In Figure 7.13, General Electric bears some foreign exchange risk because it receives 1.1% per annum in USD and pays 8% per annum in AUD.

Each exchange of payments in a fixed-for-fixed currency swap is a forward contract. As 
shown in Section 5.7, forward foreign exchange contracts can be valued by assuming that forward exchange rates are realized. A fixed-for-fixed currency swap can therefore be valued assuming that forward rates are realized.
Example 7.2
Suppose that the term structure of risk-free interest rates is flat in both Japan and 
the United States. The Japanese rate is 1.5% per annum and the U.S. rate is 2.5% per annum (both with continuous compounding). A financial institution has entered into a currency swap in which it receives 3% per annum in yen and pays 4% per annum in dollars once a year. The principals in the two currencies are  
$10 million and 1,200 million yen. The swap will last for another three years, and the current exchange rate is 110 yen per dollar. The calculations for valuing the swap as the sum of forward foreign exchange contracts are summarized in the following table (all amounts are in millions):

Total +0.9629
The financial institution pays 0.04*10=$0.4 million dollars and receives 
1,200*0.03=36 million yen each year. In addition, the dollar principal of  
$10 million is paid and the yen principal of 1,200 million is received at the end of year 3. The current spot rate is 
1>110=0.009091 dollar per yen. In this case,  
r=2.5% and rf=1.5% so that the one-year forward exchange rate is, from  
 equation (5.9), 0.009091e10.025-0.0152*1=0.009182. The two- and three-year for -
ward exchange rates in the table are calculated similarly. The forward contracts underlying the swap can be valued by assuming that the forward exchange rates are realized. If the one-year forward exchange rate is realized, the value of yen  
cash flow in year 1 will be 
36*0.009182=0.3306 million dollars and the net cash 
flow at the end of year 1 will be 0.3306-0.4=-0.0694 million dollars. This has 
a present value of -0.0694e-0.025*1=-0.0677 million dollars. This is the value 
of the forward contract corresponding to the exchange of cash flows at the end of  
year 1. The value of the other forward contracts are calculated similarly. As  
shown in the table, the total value of the forward contracts is $0.9629 million.
The value of a currency swap is normally zero when it is first negotiated. If the two principals are worth exactly the same using the exchange rate at the start of the swap, the value of the swap is also zero immediately after the initial exchange of principal. However, as in the case of interest rate swaps, this does not mean that each of the individual forward contracts underlying the swap has zero value. It can be shown that when interest rates in two currencies are significantly different, the payer of the high-interest-rate currency is in the position where the forward contracts corresponding to 7.9 VALUATION OF FIXED-FOR-FIXED CURRENCY SWAPS
M07_HULL0654_11_GE_C07.indd   190 30/04/2021   16:48Swaps 191
the early exchanges of cash flows have negative values, and the forward contract 
corresponding to final exchange of principals has a positive value. The payer of the low-interest-rate currency is likely to be in the opposite position; that is, the early exchanges of cash flows have positive values and the final exchange has a negative value.
For the payer of the low-interest-rate currency, the swap will tend to have a negative 
value during most of its life. The forward contracts corresponding to the early  
exchanges of payments have positive values, and once these exchanges have taken place, there is a tendency for the remaining forward contracts to have, in total, a  
negative value. For the payer of the high-interest-rate currency, the reverse is true. The value of the swap will tend to be positive during most of its life. Results of this sort are important when the credit risk in bilaterally cleared transactions is considered.
Valuation in Terms of Bond Prices
A fixed-for-fixed currency swap can also be valued in a straightforward way as the  difference between two bonds. If we define 
Vswap as the value in U.S. dollars of an 
 outstanding swap where dollars are received and a foreign currency is paid, that is,
Vswap=BD-S0BF
where BF is the value, measured in the foreign currency, of the bond defined by the 
foreign cash flows on the swap and BD is the value of the bond defined by the domestic 
cash flows on the swap, and S0 is the spot exchange rate (expressed as number of 
 dollars per unit of foreign currency). The value of a swap can therefore be determined 
from the term structure of interest rates in the two currencies and the spot exchange rate.
Similarly, the value of a swap where the foreign currency is received and dollars are 
paid is
Vswap=S0BF-BD
Example 7.3
Consider again the situation in Example 7.2. The term structure of risk-free  interest rates is flat in both Japan and the United States. The Japanese rate is  
1.5% per annum and the U.S. rate is 2.5% per annum (both with continuous 
 compounding). A financial institution has entered into a currency swap in which it 
receives 3% per annum in yen and pays 4% per annum in dollars once a year. The principals in the two currencies are $10 million and 1,200 million yen. The swap will last for another three years, and the current exchange rate is 
110 yen=$1. 
The calculations for valuing the swap in terms of bonds are summarized in the following table (all amounts are in millions):
Time  
(years)Cash flows on  
dollar bond ($)Present value  
($)Cash flows on  
yen bond (yen)Present value

Total 10.4191 1,252.01
M07_HULL0654_11_GE_C07.indd   191 30/04/2021   16:48192 CHAPTER 7
The cash flows from the dollar bond underlying the swap are as shown in the 
second column. The present value of the cash flows using the dollar discount rate  
of 2.5% are shown in the third column. The cash flows from the yen bond  
underlying the swap are shown in the fourth column. The present value of the 
cash flows using the yen discount rate of 1.5% are shown in the final column of  
the table. The value of the dollar bond, BD, is 10.4191 million dollars. The value 
of the yen bond is 1,252.01 million yen. The value of the swap in dollars is  
therefore 11,252.01>1102-10.4191=0.9629 million. This is in agreement with 
the calculation in Example 7.2.
Two other popular currency swaps are:
1. Fixed-for-floating where a floating interest rate in one currency is exchanged for a fixed interest rate in another currency
2. Floating-for-floating where a floating interest rate in one currency is exchanged for a floating interest rate in another currency.
An example of the first type of swap would be an exchange where a floating rate on a 
principal of £7 million is paid and 3% on a principal of $10 million is received with payments being made semiannually for 10 years. Similarly to a fixed-for-fixed currency swap, this would involve an initial exchange of principal in the opposite direction to the interest payments and a final exchange of principal in the same direction as the interest payments at the end of the swap’s life. A fixed-for-floating swap can be regarded as a portfolio consisting of a fixed-for-fixed currency swap and a fixed-for-floating interest rate swap. For instance, the swap in our example can be regarded as (a) a swap where 3% on a principal of $10 million is received and (say) 4% on a principal of £7 million is paid plus (b) an interest rate swap where 4% is received and floating is paid on a notional principal of £7 million.
To value the swap we are considering we can calculate the value of the dollar  
payments in dollars by discounting them at the dollar risk-free rate. We can calculate the value of the sterling payments by assuming that floating forward rates will be  
realized and discounting the cash flows at the sterling risk-free rate. The value of the swap is the difference between the values of the two sets of payments using current exchange rates.
An example of the second type of swap would be the exchange where floating on a 
principal of £7 million is paid and floating on a principal of $10 million is received. As  
in the other cases we have considered, this would involve an initial exchange of  principal in the opposite direction to the interest payments and a final exchange of 
principal in the same direction as the interest payments at the end of the swap’s life.  
A floating-for-floating swap can be regarded as a portfolio consisting of a fixed-for- fixed currency swap and two interest rate swaps, one in each currency. For instance, the swap in our example can be regarded as (a) a swap where 3% on a principal of  
$10 million is received and 4% on a principal of £7 million is paid plus (b) an interest rate swap where 4% is received and floating is paid on a notional principal of £7 million plus (c) an interest rate swap where 3% is paid and floating is received on a notional principal of $10 million.7.10 OTHER CURRENCY SWAPS
M07_HULL0654_11_GE_C07.indd   192 30/04/2021   16:48Swaps 193
A floating-for-floating swap can be valued by assuming that forward interest rates in 
each currency will be realized and discounting the cash flows at risk-free rates. The 
value of the swap is the difference between the values of the two sets of payments using current exchange rates.
When swaps and other derivatives are cleared through a central counterparty there is 
very little credit risk. As has been explained, standard swap transactions between a nonfinancial corporation and a derivatives dealer can be cleared bilaterally. Both sides are then potentially subject to credit risk. Consider the bilaterally cleared transaction between Intel and Citigroup in Figure 7.4. This would be netted with all other  
bilaterally cleared derivatives between Intel and Citigroup. If Intel defaults when the net value of the outstanding transactions to Citigroup is greater than the collateral (if any) posted by Intel, Citigroup will incur a loss.
8 Similarly, if Citigroup defaults when 
the net value of the outstanding transactions to Intel is greater than the collateral (if any) posted by Citigroup, Intel will incur a loss.
It is important to distinguish between the credit risk and market risk to a financial 
institution in any contract. The credit risk arises from the possibility that a loss will be incurred because of a default by the counterparty. The market risk arises from the possibility that market variables such as interest rates, equity prices, and exchange rates will move in such a way that the value of a contract to the financial institution becomes negative. Market risks can be hedged by entering into offsetting contracts; credit risks are less easy to hedge.
One of the more bizarre stories in swap markets is outlined in Business Snapshot 7.2. 
It concerns a British Local Authority, Hammersmith and Fulham, and shows that, in addition to bearing market risk and credit risk, banks trading swaps also sometimes bear legal risk.7.11 CREDIT RISK
8 The Master Agreement between Intel and Citigroup covers all oustanding derivatives and may or may not 
require collateral to be posted as the net value of the transactions changes.A swap which has grown in importance since the year 2000 is a credit default swap  
(CDS). This is a swap that allows companies to hedge credit risks in the same way that they have hedged market risks for many years. A CDS is like an insurance contract that pays off if a particular company or country defaults. The company or country is known as the reference entity. The buyer of credit protection pays an insurance premium, known as the CDS spread, to the seller of protection for the life of the contract or until the reference entity defaults. Suppose that the notional principal of the CDS is $100 million and the CDS spread for a five-year deal is 120 basis points. The insurance premium would be 120 basis points applied to $100 million or $1.2 million per year. If the reference entity does not default during the five years, nothing is received in return for the insurance premiums. If reference entity does default and bonds issued by the reference entity are worth 40 cents per dollar of principal immediately after default, the 7.12 CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS
M07_HULL0654_11_GE_C07.indd   193 30/04/2021   16:48194 CHAPTER 7
seller of protection has to make a payment to the buyer of protection equal to  
$60 million. The idea here is that, if the buyer of protection owned a portfolio of 
bonds issued by the reference entity with a principal of $100 million, the insurance payoff would be sufficient to bring the value of the portfolio back up to $100 million.
Credit default swaps are discussed in more detail in Chapter 25.Business Snapshot 7.2 The Hammersmith and Fulham Story
Between 1987 to 1989 the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham in Great Britain entered into about 600 interest rate swaps and related instruments with a total notional principal of about 6 billion pounds. The transactions appear to have been entered into for speculative rather than hedging purposes. The two employees of Hammersmith and Fulham that were responsible for the trades had only a sketchy understanding of the risks they were taking and how the products they were trading worked.
By 1989, because of movements in sterling interest rates, Hammersmith and Fulham 
had lost several hundred million pounds on the swaps. To the banks on the other side of the transactions, the swaps were worth several hundred million pounds. The banks were concerned about credit risk. They had entered into offsetting swaps to hedge their interest rate risks. If Hammersmith and Fulham defaulted they would still have to honor their obligations on the offsetting swaps and would take a huge loss.
What happened was something a little different from a default. Hammersmith and 
Fulham’s auditor asked to have the transactions declared void because Hammersmith and Fulham did not have the authority to enter into the transactions. The British courts agreed. The case was appealed and went all the way to the House of Lords, then Britain’s highest court. The final decision was that Hammersmith and Fulham did not have the authority to enter into the swaps, but that they ought to have the authority to do so in the future for risk management purposes. Needless to say, banks were furious that their contracts were overturned in this way by the courts.
Many other types of swaps are traded. We will discuss some of them in Chapter 34. At this stage we provide an overview.
Variations on the Standard Interest Rate Swap
In fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps, the frequency of payments on the two sides can be different. For example, a three-month floating rate might be exchanged for a six-month fixed rate with the first being paid every three months and the second being paid every six months. Floating rates such as the commercial paper (CP) rate are occasion-ally used. Sometimes floating-for-floating interest rates swaps (known as basis swaps) are negotiated. For example, the three-month CP rate minus 10 basis points might be exchanged for an overnight reference rate with both being applied to the same principal. (This deal would allow a company to hedge its exposure when assets and liabilities are subject to different floating rates.)7.13 OTHER TYPES OF SWAPS
M07_HULL0654_11_GE_C07.indd   194 30/04/2021   16:48Swaps 195
The principal in a swap agreement can be varied throughout the term of the swap to 
meet the needs of a counterparty. In an amortizing swap, the principal reduces in a 
predetermined way. (This might be designed to correspond to the amortization schedule on a loan.) In a step-up swap, the principal increases in a predetermined way. (This might be designed to correspond to drawdowns on a loan agreement.) Forward swaps (sometimes referred to as deferred swaps) where the parties do not begin to exchange interest payments until some future date are also sometimes arranged. Sometimes swaps are negotiated where the principal to which the fixed payments are applied is different from the principal to which the floating payments are applied.
In a compounding swap, interest on one or both sides is compounded forward to the 
end of the life of the swap according to preagreed rules and there is only one payment date at the end of the life of the swap. In an accrual swap, the interest on one side of the 
swap accrues only when the floating reference rate is in a certain range.
Quantos
Sometimes a rate observed in one currency is applied to a principal amount in another currency. One such deal would be where a U.S. floating rate is exchanged for a U.K. floating rate with both principals being applied to a principal of 10 million British pounds. This type of swap is referred to as a diff swap or a quanto.
Equity Swaps
An equity swap is an agreement to exchange the total return (dividends and capital 
gains) realized on an equity index for either a fixed or a floating rate of interest. For example, the total return on the S&P 500 in successive six-month periods might be exchanged for 3% with both being applied to the same principal. Equity swaps can be used by portfolio managers to convert returns from a fixed or floating investment to the returns from investing in an equity index, and vice versa.
Options
Sometimes there are options embedded in a swap agreement. For example, in an  
extendable swap, one party has the option to extend the life of the swap beyond the specified period. In a puttable swap, one party has the option to terminate the swap early. Options on swaps, or swaptions, are also available. These provide one party with 
the right at a future time to enter into a swap where a predetermined fixed rate is exchanged for floating.
Commodity, Volatility, and Other Swaps
Commodity swaps are in essence a series of forward contracts on a commodity with different maturity dates and the same delivery prices. In a volatility swap, there are a series of time periods. At the end of each period, one side pays a preagreed volatility while the other side pays the historical volatility realized during the period. Both  volatilities are multiplied by the same notional principal in calculating payments.
Swaps are limited only by the imagination of financial engineers and the desire of 
corporate treasurers and fund managers for exotic structures. In Chapter 34 we will 
describe the famous 5>30 swap entered into between Procter and Gamble and Bankers 
M07_HULL0654_11_GE_C07.indd   195 30/04/2021   16:48196 CHAPTER 7
Trust where payments depended in a complex way on the 30-day commercial paper rate, 
a 30-year Treasury bond price, and the yield on a 5-year Treasury bond.
SUMMARY
The two most common types of swaps are interest rate swaps and currency swaps. In an interest rate swap, one party agrees to pay the other party interest at a fixed rate on a notional principal for a number of years. In return, it receives interest at a floating rate on the same notional principal for the same period of time. In a currency swap, one  
party agrees to pay interest on a principal amount in one currency. In return, it receives interest on a principal amount in another currency.
Principal amounts are not exchanged in an interest rate swap. In a currency swap, 
principal amounts are usually exchanged at both the beginning and the end of the life of  
the swap. For a party paying interest in the foreign currency, the foreign principal is received, and the domestic principal is paid at the beginning of the life of the swap. At the end of the life of the swap, the foreign principal is paid and the domestic principal is received.
An interest rate swap can be used to transform a floating-rate loan into a fixed-rate 
loan, or vice versa. It can also be used to transform a floating-rate investment to a fixed-rate investment, or vice versa. A currency swap can be used to transform a loan in one currency into a loan in another currency. It can also be used to transform an investment denominated in one currency into an investment denominated in another currency.
The interest rate and currency swaps considered in main part of the chapter can be 
regarded portfolios of forward contracts. They can be valued by assuming the  
forward interest rates and exchange rates observed in the market today will occur  
in the future.

Practice Questions
 7.1. Companies A and B have been offered the following rates per annum on a $20 million 
five-year loan:
Fixed rate Floating rate
Company A 5.0% SOFR+0.1%
Company B 6.4% SOFR+0.6%
  Company A requires a floating-rate loan; Company B requires a fixed-rate loan. Design a swap that will net a bank, acting as intermediary, 0.1% per annum and that will appear equally attractive to both companies.
 7.2. A $100 million interest rate swap has a remaining life of 10 months. Under the terms of the swap, six-month LIBOR is exchanged for 4% per annum (compounded semiannually). Six-month LIBOR forward rates for all maturities are 3% (with semiannual compounding). The six-month LIBOR rate was 2.4% two months ago. OIS rates for all maturities are 2.7% with continuous compounding. What is the current value of the swap to the party  paying floating? What is the value to the party paying fixed?
 7.3. Company X wishes to borrow U.S. dollars at a fixed rate of interest. Company Y wishes 
to borrow Japanese yen at a fixed rate of interest. The amounts required by the two  companies are roughly the same at the current exchange rate. The companies have been 
quoted the following interest rates, which have been adjusted for the impact of taxes:
Yen Dollars
Company X 5.0% 9.6%
Company Y 6.5% 10.0%
  Design a swap that will net a bank, acting as intermediary, 50 basis points per annum. Make the swap equally attractive to the two companies and ensure that all foreign exchange risk is assumed by the bank.
 7.4. A currency swap has a remaining life of 15 months. It involves exchanging interest at 10% on £20 million for interest at 6% on $30 million once a year. The term structure of risk-free interest rates in the United Kingdom is flat at 7% and the term structure of risk-free interest rates in the United States is flat at 4% (both with annual compounding). The current exchange rate (dollars per pound sterling) is 1.5500. What is the value of the swap to the party paying sterling? What is the value of the swap to the party paying  dollars?
 7.5. Explain the difference between the credit risk and the market risk in a swap.
 7.6. A corporate treasurer tells you that he has just negotiated a five-year loan at a  competitive 
fixed rate of interest of 5.2%. The treasurer explains that he achieved the 5.2% rate by borrowing at a six-month floating reference rate plus 150 basis points and swapping the floating reference rate for 3.7%. He goes on to say that this was possible because his company has a comparative advantage in the floating-rate market. What has the trea -
surer overlooked?
M07_HULL0654_11_GE_C07.indd   197 30/04/2021   16:48198 CHAPTER 7
 7.7. A bank enters into an interest rate swap with a nonfinancial counterparty using bilaterally 
clearing where it is paying a fixed rate of 3% and receiving floating. No collateral is posted and no other transactions are outstanding between the bank and the counterparty. What credit risk is the bank subject to? Discuss whether the credit risk is greater when the yield curve is upward sloping or when it is downward sloping.
 7.8. Companies X and Y have been offered the following rates per annum on a $5 million 10-year investment:
Fixed rate Floating rate
Company X 8.0% LIBOR
Company Y 8.8% LIBOR
  Company X requires a fixed-rate investment; company Y requires a floating-rate invest-ment. Design a swap that will net a bank, acting as intermediary, 0.2% per annum and will appear equally attractive to X and Y.
 7.9. A financial institution has entered into an interest rate swap with company X. Under the terms of the swap, it receives 4% per annum and pays six-month LIBOR on a principal of $10 million for five years. Payments are made every six months. Suppose that company X defaults on the sixth payment date (end of year 3) when six-month forward LIBOR rates for all maturities are 2% per annum. What is the loss to the financial institution? Assume that six-month LIBOR was 3% per annum halfway through year 3 and that at the time of the default all OIS rates are 1.8% per annum. OIS rates are expressed with continuous compounding; other rates are expressed with semiannual compounding.
 7.10.  A financial institution has entered into a 10-year currency swap with company Y. Under the terms of the swap, the financial institution receives interest at 3% per annum in Swiss francs and pays interest at 8% per annum in U.S. dollars. Interest payments are exchanged once a year. The principal amounts are 7 million dollars and 10 million francs. Suppose that company Y declares bankruptcy at the end of year 6, when the exchange rate is $0.80 per franc. What is the cost to the financial institution? Assume that, at the end of year 6, risk-free interest rates are 3% per annum in Swiss francs and 8% per annum in U.S.  dollars for all maturities. All interest rates are quoted with annual compounding.
 7.11. Companies A and B face the following interest rates (adjusted for the differential impact 
of taxes):
Company A Company B
U.S. dollars Floating+0.5% Floating+1.0%
Canadian dollars 5.0% 6.5%
  Assume that A wants to borrow U.S. dollars at a floating rate of interest and B wants to borrow Canadian dollars at a fixed rate of interest. A financial institution is planning to arrange a swap and requires a 50-basis-point spread. If the swap is equally attractive to A and B, what rates of interest will A and B end up paying?
M07_HULL0654_11_GE_C07.indd   198 30/04/2021   16:48Swaps 199
 7.12.  After it hedges its foreign exchange risk using forward contracts, is the financial 
 institution’s average spread in Figure 7.11 likely to be greater than or less than 20 basis 
points? Explain your answer.
 7.13. “Nonfinancial companies with high credit risks are the ones that cannot access fixed-rate 
markets directly. They are the companies that are most likely to be paying fixed and receiving floating in an interest rate swap.” Assume that this statement is true. Do you think it increases or decreases the risk of a financial institution’s swap portfolio? Assume that companies are most likely to default when interest rates are high.
 7.14. Why is the expected loss to a bank from a default on a swap with a counterparty less than the expected loss from the default on a loan to the counterparty when the loan and swap have the same principal? Assume that there are no other derivatives transactions between the bank and the counterparty, that the swap is cleared bilaterally, and that no collateral is provided by the counterparty in the case of either the swap or the loan.
 7.15. A bank finds that its assets are not matched with its liabilities. It is taking floating-rate deposits and making fixed-rate loans. How can swaps be used to offset the risk?
 7.16.  Explain how you would value a swap that is the exchange of a floating rate in one  currency for a fixed rate in another currency.
 7.17. OIS rates are 3.4% for all maturities. What is the value of an OIS swap with two years to 
maturity where 3% is received and the floating reference rate is paid. Assume annual compounding, annual payments, and $100 million principal.
 7.18.  A financial institution has entered into a swap where it agreed to make quarterly payments at a rate of 3% per annum and receive the SOFR three-month reference rate on a notional principal of $100 million. The swap now has a remaining life of 7.5 months. Assume the risk-free rates with continuous compounding (calculated from SOFR) for 1.5, 4.5, and 7.5 months are 2.8%, 3.0%, and 3.1%, respectively. Assume also that the conti nuously 
 compounded risk-free rate observed for the last 1.5 months is 2.7%. Estimate the value 
of the swap.
 7.19. (a) Company A has been offered the swap quotes in Table 7.4. It can borrow for three 
years at 3.45%. What floating rate can it swap this fixed rate into? (b) Company B has been offered the swap quotes in Table 7.4. It can borrow for five years at floating plus 75 basis points. What fixed rate can it swap this rate into? (c) Explain the rollover risks that Company B is taking.
 7.20.  The one-year LIBOR rates is 3%, and the LIBOR forward rate for the 1 - to 2-year period is 3.2%. The three-year swap rate for a swap with annual payments is 3.2%. What is the LIBOR forward rate for the 2- to 3-year period if OIS zero rates for maturities of one, two, and three years are 2.5%, 2.7%, and 2.9%, respectively. What is the value of a three-year swap where 4% is received and LIBOR is paid on a principal of $100 million. All rates are annually compounded.
 7.21. A financial institution has entered into a swap where it agreed to receive quarterly 
 payments at a rate of 2% per annum and pay the SOFR three-month reference rate on  
a notional principal of $100 million. The swap now has a remaining life of 10 months. 
Assume the risk-free rates with continuous compounding (calculated from SOFR) for  
1 month, 4 months, 7 months, and 10 months are 1.4%, 1.6%, 1.7%, and 1.8%, 
M07_HULL0654_11_GE_C07.indd   199 30/04/2021   16:48200 CHAPTER 7
 respectively. Assume also that the continuously compounded risk-free rate observed for 
the last two months is 1.1%. Estimate the value of the swap.
 7.22.  Company A, a British manufacturer, wishes to borrow U.S. dollars at a fixed rate of  interest. Company B, a U.S. multinational, wishes to borrow sterling at a fixed rate of 
interest. They have been quoted the following rates per annum:
Sterling U.S. Dollars
Company A 11.0% 7.0%
Company B 10.6% 6.2%
  (Rates have been adjusted for differential tax effects.) Design a swap that will net a bank, acting as intermediary, 10 basis points per annum and that will produce a gain of 15 basis points per annum for each of the two companies.
 7.23. The five-year swap rate when cash flows are exchanged semiannually is 4%. A company 
wants a swap where it receives payments at 4.2% per annum on a notional principal of $10 million. The OIS zero curve is flat at 3.6%. How much should a derivatives dealer charge the company. Assume that all rates are expressed with semiannual compounding and ignore bid–ask spreads.

Derivatives such as forwards, futures, swaps, and options are concerned with transferring 
risk from one entity in the economy to another. The first seven chapters of this book have focused on forwards, futures, and swaps. Before moving on to discuss options, we  
consider another important way of transferring risk in the economy: securitization.
Securitization is of particular interest because of its role in the financial crisis that 
started in 2007. The crisis had its origins in financial products created from mortgages in the United States, but rapidly spread from the United States to other countries and from financial markets to the real economy. Some financial institutions failed; others had to be rescued by national governments. There can be no question that the first decade of the twenty-first century was disastrous for the financial sector.
In this chapter, we examine the nature of securitization and its role in the crisis. In 
the course of the chapter, we will learn about the U.S. mortgage market, asset-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations, waterfalls, and the importance of incentives in financial markets.Securitization 
and the Financial 
Crisis of 2007–88 CHAPTER  
Traditionally, banks have funded their loans primarily from deposits. In the 1960s, U.S. banks found that they could not keep pace with the demand for residential mortgages with this type of funding. This led to the development of the mortgage-backed security (MBS) market. Organizations that were active in this market are:
• The Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA, also known as Ginnie Mae)
• The Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA, also known as Fannie Mae)
• The Federal Home Loan Mortagage Corporation (FHLMC, also known as  
Freddie Mac).
These organizations bought portfolios of mortgages from the originating banks and packaged them as securities that were sold to investors. They guaranteed (for a fee) the interest and principal payments on the mortgages.
Thus, although banks originated the mortgages, they did not keep them on their 
balance sheets. Securitization allowed them to increase their lending faster than their 8.1 SECURITIZATION
M08_HULL0654_11_GE_C08.indd   201 30/04/2021   16:49202 CHAPTER 8
deposits were growing. The guarantees provided by GNMA, FNMA, and FHLMC 
protected MBS investors against defaults by borrowers.1
In the 1980s, the securitization techniques developed for the mortgage market were 
applied to asset classes such as automobile loans and credit card receivables in the United States. Securitization also become popular in other parts of the world. As the securitization market developed, investors became comfortable with situations where they did not have a guarantee against defaults by borrowers.
ABSs
A securitization arrangement of the type used during the 2000 to 2007 period (with no guarantees against default) is shown in Figure 8.1. This is known as an asset-backed security or ABS. A portfolio of income-producing assets such as loans is sold by the originating banks to a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and the cash flows from the assets are then allocated to tranches. Figure 8.1 is simpler than the structures that were  
typically created because it has only three tranches (in practice, many more tranches were used). These are the senior tranche, the mezzanine tranche, and the equity tranche.
The portfolio in Figure 8.1 has a principal of $100 million. This is divided as follows: 
$80 million to the senior tranche, $15 million to the mezzanine tranche, and $5 million to the equity tranche. The senior tranche’s return is LIBOR plus 60 basis points, the mezzanine tranche’s return is LIBOR plus 250 basis points, and the equity tranche’s return is LIBOR plus 2,000 basis points.
1 However, MBS investors did face uncertainty about mortgage prepayments. Prepayments tend to be  
greatest when interest rates are low and the reinvestment opportunities open to investors are not particularly 
attractive. In the early days of MBSs, many MBS investors realized lower returns than they expected because they did not take this into account.Asset 1

It sounds as though the equity tranche has the best deal, but this is not necessarily the 
case. The payments of interest and principal are not guaranteed. The return is like the 
yield on a bond. It is the return that will be realized if there are no defaults affecting the tranche. As we will see, the equity tranche is more likely to lose part of its principal, and less likely to receive the promised interest payments on its outstanding principal, than the other tranches.
Cash flows are allocated to tranches by specifying what is known as a waterfall. The 
general way a waterfall works is illustrated in Figure 8.2. A separate waterfall is applied to 
principal and interest payments. Principal payments are allocated to the senior tranche until its principal has been fully repaid. They are then allocated to mezzanine tranche until its principal has been fully repaid. Only after this has happened do principal  
repayments go to the equity tranche. Interest payments are allocated to the senior tranche until the senior tranche has received its promised return on its outstanding principal. Assuming that this promised return can be made, interest payments are then allocated to the mezzanine tranche. If the promised return to the mezzanine tranche can be made and cash flows are left over, they are allocated to pay interest on the equity tranche.
The extent to which the tranches get their principal back depends on losses on the 
underlying assets. The effect of the waterfall is roughly as follows. The first 5% of losses are borne by the equity tranche. If losses exceed 5%, the equity tranche loses all its principal and some losses are borne by the principal of the mezzanine tranche. If losses exceed 20%, the mezzanine tranche loses all its principal and some losses are borne by the principal of the senior tranche.
There are therefore two ways of looking at an ABS. One is with reference to the 
waterfall in Figure 8.2. Cash flows go first to the senior tranche, then to the mezzanine tranche, and then to the equity tranche. The other is in terms of losses. Losses of principal are first borne by the equity tranche, then by the mezzanine tranche, and then by the senior tranche. Rating agencies such as Moody’s, S&P , and Fitch played a key role in securitization. The ABS in Figure 8.1 is likely to be designed so that the senior tranche is given the highest possible rating, AAA. The mezzanine tranche is typically rated BBB (well below AAA, but still investment grade). The equity tranche is typically unrated.

The description of ABSs that we have given so far is somewhat simplified. Typically, 
more than three tranches with a wide range of ratings were created. In the waterfall rules, 
as we have described them, the allocation of cash flows to tranches is sequential in that they always flow first to the most senior tranche, then to the next most senior tranche, and so on. In practice, the rules are somewhat more complicated than this and are described in a legal document that is several hundred pages long. Another complication is that there was often some overcollateralization where the total principal of the tranches was less than the total principal of the underlying assets. Also, the weighted average return  
promised to the tranches was less than the weighted average return payable on the assets.

ABS CDOs
Finding investors to buy the senior AAA-rated tranches of ABSs was usually not difficult, because the tranches promised returns that were very attractive when compared with the return on AAA-rated bonds. Equity tranches were typically retained by the originator of the assets or sold to a hedge fund.
Finding investors for mezzanine tranches was more difficult. This led to the creation of 
ABSs of ABSs. The way this was done is shown in Figure 8.3. Many different mezzanine tranches, created in the way indicated in Figure 8.1, are put in a portfolio and the risks associated with the cash flows from the portfolio are tranched out in the same way as the risks associated with cash flows from the assets are tranched out in Figure 8.1. The resulting structure is known as an ABS CDO or Mezz ABS CDO. (CDO is short for 
collateralized debt obligation.) In the example in Figure 8.3, the senior tranche of the ABS CDO accounts for 65% of the principal of the ABS mezzanine tranches, the  
mezzanine tranche of the ABS CDO accounts for 25% of the principal, and the equity tranche accounts for the remaining 10% of the principal. The structure is designed so that the senior tranche of the ABS CDO is given the highest credit rating of AAA. This means that the total of the AAA-rated instruments created in the example that is  
considered here is about 90% (80% plus 65% of 15%) of the principal of the underlying portfolios. This seems high but, if the securitization were carried further with an ABS being created from tranches of ABS CDOs (and this did happen), the percentage would be pushed even higher.

its creator.Assets Senior tranche (80%)

In the example in Figure 8.3, the AAA-rated tranche of the ABS can expect to receive 
its promised return and get its principal back if losses on the underlying portfolio of 
assets is less than 20% because all losses of principal would then be absorbed by the more junior tranches. The AAA-rated tranche of the ABS CDO in Figure 8.3 is more risky. It will receive the promised return and get its principal back if losses on the  
underlying assets are 10.25% or less. This is because a loss of 10.25% means that  
mezzanine tranches of ABSs have to absorb losses equal to 5.25% of the ABS principal. As these tranches have a total principal equal to 15% of the ABS principal, they lose 5.25> 15 or 35% of their principal. The equity and mezzanine tranches of the ABS CDO 
are then wiped out, but the senior tranche just manages to survive intact.
The senior tranche of the ABS CDO suffers losses if losses on the underlying 
portfolios are more than 10.25%. Consider, for example, the situation where losses are 17% on the underlying portfolios. Of the 17%, 5% is borne by the equity tranche of the ABS and 12% by the mezzanine tranche of the ABS. Losses on the mezzanine tranches are therefore 12> 15 or 80% of their principal. The first 35% is absorbed by the 
equity and mezzanine tranches of the ABS CDO. The senior tranche of the ABS CDO therefore loses 45> 65 or 69.2% of its value. These and other results are summarized in 
Table 8.1. Our calculations assume that all ABS portfolios have the same default rate.Table 8.1 Estimated losses to tranches of ABS CDO in Figure 8.3.

Figure 8.4 gives the S&P>Case–Shiller composite-10 index for house prices in the 
United States between January 1987 and February 2020. This tracks house prices for  
ten metropolitan areas of the United States. It shows that, in about the year 2000, house prices started to rise much faster than they had in the previous decade. The very low level of interest rates between 2002 and 2005 was an important contributory factor, but the bubble in house prices was also fueled by mortgage-lending practices.
The 2000 to 2006 period was characterized by a huge increase in what is termed 
subprime mortgage lending. Subprime mortgages are mortgages that are considered to be significantly more risky than average. Before 2000, most mortgages classified as subprime were second mortgages. After 2000, this changed as financial institutions became more comfortable with the notion of a subprime first mortgage.
The Relaxation of Lending Standards
The relaxation of lending standards and the growth of subprime mortgages made house purchase possible for many families that had previously been considered to be not 8.2 THE U.S. HOUSING MARKET
M08_HULL0654_11_GE_C08.indd   205 30/04/2021   16:49206 CHAPTER 8
sufficiently creditworthy to qualify for a mortgage. These families increased the demand 
for real estate and prices rose. To mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders, it was  
attractive to make more loans, particularly when higher house prices resulted. More lending meant bigger profits. Higher house prices meant that the lending was well covered by the underlying collateral. If the borrower defaulted, it was less likely that the resulting foreclosure would lead to a loss.
Mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders naturally wanted to keep increasing their 
profits. Their problem was that, as house prices rose, it was more difficult for first-time buyers to afford a house. In order to continue to attract new entrants to the housing market, they had to find ways to relax their lending standards even more—and this is exactly what they did. The amount lent as a percentage of the house price increased. Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMS) were developed where there was a low “teaser” rate of interest that would last for two or three years and be followed by a rate that was much higher.
3 A typical teaser rate was about 6% and the interest rate after the 
end of the teaser rate period was typically six-month LIBOR plus 6%.4 However, 
teaser rates as low as 1% or 2% have been reported. Lenders also became more cavalier in the way they reviewed mortgage applications. Indeed, the applicant’s income and other information reported on the application form were frequently not checked.
Subprime Mortgage Securitization
Subprime mortgages were frequently securitized in the way indicated in Figures 8.1  
to 8.3. The investors in tranches created from subprime mortgages usually had no  
3 If real estate prices increased, lenders expected the borrowers to prepay and take out a new mortgage at the 
end of the teaser rate period. However, prepayment penalties, often zero on prime mortgages, were quite high 
on subprime mortgages.

remaining 28 years.50100150200250

guarantees that interest and principal would be paid. Securitization played a part in the 
crisis. The behavior of mortgage originators was influenced by their knowledge that mortgages would be securitized.
5 When considering new mortgage applications, the 
question was not “Is this a credit risk we want to assume?” Instead it was “Is this a mortgage we can make money on by selling it to someone else?”
When a portfolio of mortgages was securitized, the buyers of the products that were 
created felt they had enough information if they knew, for each mortgage in the  
portfolio, the loan-to-value ratio (i.e., the ratio of the size of the loan to the assessed value of the house) and the borrower’s FICO score.
6 Other information on the  
mortgage application forms was considered irrelevant and, as already mentioned, was often not even checked by lenders. The most important thing for the lender was whether the mortgage could be sold to others—and this depended largely on the loan-to-value ratio and the applicant’s FICO score.
It is interesting to note in passing that both the loan-to-value ratio and the FICO 
score were of doubtful quality. The property assessors who determined the value of a house at the time of a mortgage application sometimes succumbed to pressure from the lenders to come up with high values. Potential borrowers were sometimes counseled to take certain actions that would improve their FICO scores.
7
Why was the government not regulating the behavior of mortgage lenders? The 
answer is that the U.S. government had since the 1990s been trying to expand home ownership and had been applying pressure to mortgage lenders to increase loans to low- and moderate-income people. Some state legislators, such as those in Ohio and  
Georgia, were concerned about what was going on and wanted to curtail predatory lending.
8 However, the courts decided that national standards should prevail.
A number of terms have been used to describe mortgage lending during the period 
leading up to the 2007–8 crisis. One is “liar loans” because individuals applying for a mortgage, knowing that no checks would be carried out, sometimes chose to lie on the application form. Another term used to describe some borrowers is “NINJA” (no income, no job, no assets).
The Bubble Bursts
All bubbles burst eventually and this one was no exception. In 2007, many mortgage holders found they could no longer afford their mortgages when the teaser rates ended. This led to foreclosures and large numbers of houses coming on the market, which in turn led to a decline in house prices. Other mortgage holders, who had borrowed 100%, or close to 100%, of the cost of a house found that they had negative equity.
One of the features of the U.S. housing market is that mortgages are nonrecourse in 
many states. This means that, when there is a default, the lender is able to take  
possession of the house, but other assets of the borrower are off-limits. Consequently, the borrower has a free American-style put option. He or she can at any time sell the

6 FICO is a credit score developed by the Fair Isaac Corporation and is widely used in the United States. It 
ranges from 300 to 850.
7 One such action might be to make regular payments on a new credit card for a few months.
8 Predatory lending describes the situation where a lender deceptively convinces borrowers to agree to unfair 
and abusive loan terms.
M08_HULL0654_11_GE_C08.indd   207 30/04/2021   16:49208 CHAPTER 8
house to the lender for the principal outstanding on the mortgage. This feature 
encouraged speculative activity and was partly responsible for the bubble. Market participants realized belatedly how costly and destabilizing the put option could be. If the borrower had negative equity, the optimal decision was to exchange the house for the outstanding principal on the mortgage. The house was then sold by the lender, adding to the downward pressure on house prices.
It would be a mistake to assume that all mortgage defaulters were in the same 
position. Some were unable to meet mortgage payments and suffered greatly when they had to give up their homes. But many of the defaulters were speculators who bought multiple homes as rental properties and chose to exercise their put options. It was their tenants who suffered. There are also reports that some house owners (who were not speculators) were quite creative in extracting value from their put options. After handing the keys to their houses to the lender, they turned around and bought (some-times at a bargain price) other houses that were in foreclosure. Imagine two people owning identical houses next to each other. Both have mortgages of $250,000. Both houses are worth $200,000 and in foreclosure can be expected to sell for $170,000. What is the owners’ optimal strategy? The answer is that each person should exercise the put option and buy the neighbor’s house.
The United States was not alone in having declining real estate prices. Prices declined 
in many other countries as well. Real estate prices in the United Kingdom were  
particularly badly affected. As Figure 8.4 indicates, average house prices in the United States did recover after 2012.
The Losses
As foreclosures increased, the losses on mortgages also increased. It might be thought that a 35% reduction in house prices would lead to at most a 35% loss of principal on defaulting mortgages. In fact, the losses were far greater than that. Houses in fore-closure were often in poor condition and sold for a small fraction of their value prior to the financial crisis. In 2008 and 2009, losses as high 75% of the mortgage principal were reported for mortgages on houses in foreclosure in some cases.
Investors in tranches that were formed from the mortgages incurred big losses. The 
value of the ABS tranches created from subprime mortgages was monitored by a series of indices known as ABX. These indices indicated that the tranches originally rated BBB had lost about 80% of their value by the end of 2007 and about 97% of their value by mid-2009. The value of the ABS CDO tranches created from BBB tranches was monitored by a series of indices known as TABX. These indices indicated that the tranches originally rated AAA lost about 80% of their value by the end of 2007 and were essentially worthless by mid-2009.
Financial institutions such as UBS, Merrill Lynch, and Citigroup had big positions 
in some of the tranches and incurred huge losses, as did the insurance giant AIG, which provided protection against losses on ABS CDO tranches that had originally been rated AAA. Many financial institutions had to be rescued with government funds. There have been few worse years in financial history than 2008. Bear Stearns was taken over by JP Morgan Chase; Merrill Lynch was taken over by Bank of America; Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which had formerly been investment banks, became bank holding companies with both commercial and investment banking interests; and Lehman Brothers was allowed to fail (see Business Snapshot 1. 1).

Credit Spreads
The losses on securities backed by residential mortgages led to a severe financial crisis. In 
2006, banks were reasonably well capitalized, loans were relatively easy to obtain, and credit spreads (the excess of the interest rate on a loan over the risk-free interest rate) were low. By 2008, the situation was totally different. The capital of banks had been badly eroded by their losses. They had become much more risk-averse and were reluctant to lend. Creditworthy individuals and corporations found borrowing difficult. Credit spreads had increased dramatically. The world experienced its worst recession in several generations. The three-month LIBOR–OIS spread briefly reached 364 basis points in October 2008, indicating an extreme reluctance of banks to lend to each other for longer periods than overnight. Another measure of the stress in financial markets is the TED spread. This is the excess of the three-month Eurodollar deposit rate over the three-month Treasury interest. In normal market conditions, it is 30 to 50 basis points. It reached over 450 basis points in October 2008.
“Irrational exuberance” is a phrase coined by Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal 
Reserve Board, to describe the behavior of investors during the bull market of the 1990s. It can also be applied to the period leading up to the financial crisis. Mortgage lenders, the investors in tranches of ABSs and ABS CDOs that were created from residential mortgages, and the companies that sold protection on the tranches assumed that the good times would last for ever. They thought that U.S. house prices would continue to increase. There might be declines in one or two areas, but the possibility of the  
widespread decline shown in Figure 8.4 was a scenario not considered by most people.
Many factors contributed to the crisis that started in 2007. Mortgage originators 
used lax lending standards. Products were developed to enable mortgage originators to profitably transfer credit risk to investors. Rating agencies moved from their traditional business of rating bonds, where they had a great deal of experience, to rating structured products, which were relatively new and for which there were relatively little historical data. The products bought by investors were complex and in many instances investors and rating agencies had inaccurate or incomplete information about the quality of the underlying assets. Investors in the structured products that were created thought they had found a money machine and chose to rely on rating agencies rather than forming their own opinions about the underlying risks. The return offered by the products rated AAA was high compared with the returns on bonds rated AAA.
Structured products such as those in Figures 8.1 and 8.3 are highly dependent on the 
default correlation between the underlying assets. Default correlation measures the tendency for different borrowers to default at about the same time. If the default  
correlation between the underlying assets in Figure 8.1 is low, the AAA-rated tranches are very unlikely to experience losses. As this default correlation increases, they become more vulnerable. The tranches of ABS CDOs in Figure 8.3 are even more heavily dependent on default correlation.
If mortgages exhibit moderate default correlation (as they do in normal times), there 
is very little chance of a high overall default rate and the AAA-rated tranches of both ABSs and ABS CDOs that are created from mortgages are fairly safe. However, as 8.3 WHAT WENT WRONG?
M08_HULL0654_11_GE_C08.indd   209 30/04/2021   16:49210 CHAPTER 8
many investors found to their cost, default correlations tend to increase in stressed 
market conditions. This makes very high default rates possible.
There was a tendency to assume that a tranche with a particular rating could be 
equated to a bond with the that rating. The rating agencies published the criteria they used for rating tranches. S&P and Fitch rated a tranche so as to ensure that the  
probability of the tranche experiencing a loss was the same as the probability of a  
similarly rated bond experiencing a loss. Moody’s rated a tranche so that the expected loss from the tranche was the the same as the expected loss from a similarly rated bond.
9 
The procedures used by rating agencies were therefore designed to ensure that one aspect of the loss distributions of tranches and bonds were matched. However, other aspects of the distributions were liable to be quite different.
The differences between tranches and bonds were accentuated by the fact tranches 
were often quite thin. The AAA tranches often accounted for about 80% of the  
principal as in Figure 8.1, but it was not unusual for there to be 15 to 20 other  
tranches. Each of these tranches would be 1% or 2% wide. Such thin tranches are likely to either incur no losses or be totally wiped out. The chance of investors  
recovering part of their principal (as bondholders usually do) is small. Consider, for example, a BBB tranche that is responsible for losses in the range 5% to 6%, If losses on the underlying portfolio are less than 5%, the tranche is safe. If losses are greater than 6%, the tranche is wiped out. Only in the case where losses are between 5% and 6% is a partial recovery made by investors.
The difference between a thin BBB-rated tranche and a BBB-rated bond was over-
looked by many investors. The difference makes the tranches of ABS CDOs created from the BBB-rated tranches of ABSs much riskier than tranches created in a similar way from BBB bonds. Losses on a portfolio of BBB bonds can reasonably be assumed to be unlikely to exceed 25% in even the most severe market conditions. Table 8.1 
shows that 100% losses on a portfolio of BBB tranches can occur relatively easily—and this is even more true when the tranches are only 1% or 2% wide.
Regulatory Arbitrage
Many of the mortgages were originated by banks and it was banks that were the main investors in the tranches that were created from the mortgages. Why would banks choose to securitize mortgages and then buy the securitized products that were created? The answer concerns what is termed regulatory arbitrage. The regulatory capital banks were required to keep for the tranches created from a portfolio of mortgages was much less than the regulatory capital that would be required for the mortgages themselves.
Incentives
One of the lessons from the crisis is the importance of incentives. Economists use the term “agency costs” to describe the situation where incentives are such that the interests of two parties in a business relationship are not perfectly aligned. The process by which 
9 For a discussion of the criteria used by rating agencies and the reasonableness of the ratings given the  
criteria used, see J. C. Hull and A. White, “Ratings Arbitrage and Structured Products, ” Journal of  
Derivatives, 20, 1 (Fall 2012): 80–86, and “The Risk of Tranches Created from Mortgages, ” Financial  
Analysts Journal, 66, 5 (September/October 2010): 54–67.
M08_HULL0654_11_GE_C08.indd   210 30/04/2021   16:49Securitization and the Financial Crisis of 2007–8 211
mortgages were originated, securitized, and sold to investors was unfortunately riddled 
with agency costs.
The incentive of the originators of mortgages was to make loans that would be 
acceptable to the creators of the ABS and ABS CDO tranches. The incentive of the individuals who valued the houses on which the mortgages were written was to please the lender by providing as high a valuation as possible so that the loan-to-value ratio was as low as possible. (Pleasing the lender was likely to lead to more business from that lender.) The main concern of the creators of tranches was how the tranches would be rated. They wanted the volume of AAA-rated tranches that they created to be as  
high as possible and found ways of using the published criteria of rating agencies to achieve this. The rating agencies were paid by the issuers of the securities they rated and about half their income came from structured products.
Another source of agency costs concerns the incentives of the employees of financial 
institutions. Employee compensation falls into three categories: regular salary, the end-of-year bonus, and stock or stock options. Many employees at all levels of seniority in financial institutions, particularly traders, receive much of their compensation in the form of end-of-year bonuses. This form of compensation is focused on short-term  
performance. If an employee generates huge profits one year and is responsible for severe losses the next, the employee will often receive a big bonus the first year and will not have to return it the following year. (The employee might lose his or her job as a result of the second year losses, but even that is not a disaster. Financial institutions seem to be surprisingly willing to recruit individuals with losses on their résumés.)
Imagine you are an employee of a financial institution in 2006 responsible for  
investing in ABS CDOs created from mortgages. Almost certainly you would have recognized that there was a bubble in the U.S. housing market and would expect that bubble to burst sooner or later. However, it is possible that you would decide to  
continue with your ABS CDO investments. If the bubble did not burst until after the end of 2006, you would still get a nice bonus at the end of 2006.
Prior to the crisis, over-the-counter derivatives markets were largely unregulated. This 
has changed. As mentioned in earlier chapters, there is now a requirement that most standardized over-the-counter derivatives be cleared through central counterparties (CCPs). This means that they are treated similarly to derivatives such as futures that trade on exchanges. Banks are usually members of one or more CCPs. When trading standardized derivatives, they are required to post initial margin and variation margin with the CCP and are also required to contribute to a default fund. For transactions between financial institutions that continue to be cleared bilaterally, collateral arrange-ments are now regulated rather than chosen by the parties involved.
The bonuses paid by banks have come under more scrutiny and in some jurisdictions 
there are limits on the size of the bonuses that can be paid. The way bonuses are paid is changing. Before the crisis it was common for a trader’s bonus for a year to be paid in full at the end of the year with no possibility of the bonus having to be returned. It is now more common for this bonus to be spread over several years so that part of the bonus can be clawed back if results are not as good as expected.
8.4 THE AFTERMATH
M08_HULL0654_11_GE_C08.indd   211 30/04/2021   16:49212 CHAPTER 8
The Dodd–Frank Act in the United States and similar legislation in the United 
Kingdom and European Union provide for more oversight of financial institutions and 
include much new legislation affecting financial institutions. For example, in the United States proprietary trading and other similar activities of deposit-taking institutions are being restricted. (This is known as the “Volcker rule” because it was proposed by  
former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker.) An independent committee in the United Kingdom chaired by Sir John Vickers has proposed that the retail operations of banks be ring-fenced. The Liikanen committee in the European Union similarly  
recommends that proprietary trading and other high-risk activities be separated from other banking activities.
Banks throughout the world are regulated by the Basel Committee on Banking 
Supervision.
10 Prior to the crisis, the committee implemented regulations known as 
Basel I and Basel II. These are summarized in Business Snapshot 8.1. Following the crisis, it has implemented what is known as “Basel II.5. ” This increases the capital requirements for market risk. Basel III was published in 2010 has been implemented over a period lasting until 2019. It increases the amount of capital and quality of capital that banks are required to keep. It also requires banks to satisfy certain liquidity  
requirements. As discussed in Business Snapshot 4.2, one cause of problems during the crisis was the tendency of banks to place too much reliance on the use of short-term liabilities for long-term funding needs. The liquidity requirements are designed to make it more difficult for them to do this. Basel IV , to be implemented between 2022 and 2027, revises some of the rules in Basel III and reduces the extent to which banks can use their own internal models to determine their capital requirements.Business Snapshot 8.1 The Basel Committee
As the activities of banks became more global in the 1980s, it became necessary for regulators in different countries to work together to determine an international  
regulatory framework. As a result the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision was formed. In 1988, it published a set of rules for the capital banks were required to keep for credit risk. These capital requirements have become known as Basel I.  
They were modified to accommodate the netting of transactions in 1995. In 1996 a new capital requirement for market risk was published. This capital requirement was implemented in 1998. In 1999 significant changes were proposed for the  
calculation of the capital requirements for credit risk and a capital requirement  
for operational risk was introduced. These rules are referred to as Basel II. Basel II is considerably more complicated than Basel I and its implementation was delayed until 2007 (later in some countries). During the financial crisis and afterwards, the Basel committee introduced new regulatory requirements known as Basel II.5, which increased capital for market risk. This was followed by Basel III, which  
tightened capital requirements and introduced liquidity requirements. Basel IV , which will be implemented between 2022 and 2027, revises Basel III, placing more emphasis on standardized approaches developed by the Basel committee for  
determining capital requirements.

SUMMARY
Securitization is a process used by banks to create securities from loans and other 
income-producing assets. The securities are sold to investors. This removes the loans from the banks’ balance sheets and enables the banks to expand their lending faster than would otherwise be possible. The first loans to be securitized were mortgages in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s. Investors who bought the mortgage-backed  
securities were not exposed to the risk of borrowers defaulting because the loans were backed by the Government National Mortgage Association. Later automobile loans, corporate loans, credit card receivables, and subprime mortgages were securitized. In many cases, investors in the securities created from these instruments did not have a guarantee against defaults.
Securitization played a part in the financial crisis that started in 2007. Tranches were 
created from subprime mortgages and new tranches were then created from these tranches. The origins of the crisis can be found in the U.S. housing market. The U.S. government was keen to encourage home ownership. Interest rates were low. Mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders found it attractive to do more business by relaxing their lending standards. Securitization meant that the investors bearing the credit risk were not usually the same as the original lenders. Rating agencies gave AAA ratings to the senior tranches that were created. There was no shortage of buyers for these AAA-rated tranches because their yields were higher than the yields on other AAA-rated securities. Banks thought the “good times” would continue and, because compensation plans focused their attention on short-term profits, chose to ignore the housing bubble and its potential impact on some very complicated products they were trading.
House prices rose as both first-time buyers and speculators entered the market. Some 
mortgages had included a low “teaser rate” for two or three years. After the teaser rate ended, there was a significant increase in the interest rate for some borrowers. Unable to meet the higher interest rate they had no choice but to default. This led to foreclosures and an increase in the supply of houses be sold. The price increases between 2000 and 2006 began to be reversed. Speculators and others who found that the amount owing on their mortgages was greater than the value of their houses (i.e., they had negative equity) defaulted. This accentuated the price decline.
Banks are paying a price for the crisis. New legislation and regulation will reduce their 
profitability. For example, capital requirements are being increased, liquidity regulations are being introduced, and OTC derivatives are being much more tightly regulated.

 8.11.  “Resecuritization was a badly flawed idea. AAA tranches created from the mezzanine tranches of ABSs are bound to have a higher probability of default than the AAA-rated tranches of ABSs. ” Discuss this point of view.
 8.12.  Suppose that mezzanine tranches of the ABS CDOs, similar to those in Figure 8.3, are resecuritized to form what is referred to as a “CDO squared. ” As in the case of tranches created from ABSs in Figure 8.3, 65% of the principal is allocated to a AAA tranche,  
25% to a BBB tranche, and 10% to the equity tranche. How high does the loss percentage have to be on the underlying assets for losses to be experienced by a AAA-rated tranche that is created in this way? (Assume that every portfolio of assets that is used to create ABSs experiences the same loss rate.)

XVAs
Before moving on to discuss how options and other more complex derivatives are  
valued, we consider various price adjustments that have become important in derivatives 
markets. These are the credit valuation adjustment (CVA), the debit (or debt) valuation adjustment (DVA), the funding valuation adjustment (FVA), the margin valuation adjustment (MVA), and the capital valuation adjustment (KVA). Collectively the adjustments are known as XVAs. Some of the adjustments have a stronger theoretical basis than others. As we shall see, financial economists have no problem with CVA and DVA, but have reservations about FVA, MVA, and KVA.9 CHAPTER  
Most of this book is concerned with determining the no-default value of derivatives, that is, the value assuming that neither of the two sides will default. CVA and DVA are adjustments to the no-default value reflecting the possibility of a default by one of the two sides. Here we provide an overview of them. More details on their calculation are in Chapter 24.
Suppose that a bank and a counterparty have entered into a portfolio of derivative 
transactions that are cleared bilaterally. The master agreement between the bank and the counterparty will almost certainly state that netting applies. This means that all outstanding derivatives between the two sides are considered as a single derivative in the event of a default. When one party declares bankruptcy, fails to post collateral as required, or fails to perform as promised in some other way, the other party will declare an event of default. This leads to an early termination of the outstanding derivatives between the bank and the counterparty a few days later and a settlement amount is calculated. The settlement amount reflects the value of the derivatives and is adjusted to allow for the fact that the nondefaulting party will incur costs equal to half the  
applicable bid–ask spreads when replacing the transactions in the portfolio.
Suppose that it is the bank’s counterparty that defaults and neither side posts  
collateral. (Later we explain the impact of collateral.) If the early termination happens when the outstanding derivatives portfolio has a positive value to the bank and a  
negative value to the counterparty, the bank will be an unsecured creditor for the  
settlement amount and is likely to incur a loss because it will fail to receive it in full. In 9.1 CVA AND DVA
M09_HULL0654_11_GE_C09.indd   216 30/04/2021   16:50XVAs 217
the opposite situation, where the portfolio has a negative value to the bank and a  
positive value to the counterparty, the settlement amount is owed by the bank to the 
counterparty (or to the counterparty’s liquidators) and will be paid in full so that there is no loss.
The credit valuation adjustment (CVA) is the bank’s estimate of the present value of 
the expected cost to the bank of a counterparty default. Suppose that the life of the longest outstanding derivatives transaction between the bank and the counterparty is T years. To calculate CVA, the bank divides the next T years into a number of intervals. 
For each interval, it calculates:
1. The probability of an early termination during the interval arising from a  
counterparty default; and
2. The present value of the expected loss from the derivatives portfolio if there is an early termination at the midpoint of the interval.
Suppose that there are N intervals, 
qi is the probability of default by the counterparty 
during the ith interval, and vi is the present value of the expected loss if there is a  
default at the midpoint of the ith interval. CVA is calculated as:
 CVA=aN
i=1  qivi (9.1)
This formula is deceptively simple but the procedure for implementing it is quite com-
plicated and computationally very time-consuming. It will be explained in Chapter 24.
Define fnd as the no-default value of the derivatives portfolio to the bank. As 
explained earlier, this is the value of the portfolio assuming that neither side will default. When the possibility of a counterparty default is taken into account, the value of the portfolio to the bank becomes
fnd-CVA
But this is not the end of the story. The bank itself might default. This is liable to lead to a loss to the counterparty and an equal and opposite gain to the bank. The debit (or debt) valuation adjustment (DVA) is the present value of the expected gain to the bank from the possibility that it might itself default. It is calculated similarly to CVA:
 
DVA=aN
i=1q*
iv*
i (9.2)
where q*i is the probability of a default by the bank during the ith interval and v*i is the 
present value of the bank’s gain (and the counterparty’s loss) if the bank defaults at the 
midpoint of the interval. Taking both CVA and DVA into account, the value of the portfolio to the bank is
fnd-CVA+DVA
The idea that a bank will gain from its own default seems strange to many people. How can there be a gain from a default? One way of thinking about this is as follows.  
Derivatives are what are referred to as “zero-sum games.” The gain to one side always equals the loss to the other side. If the bank’s counterparty is worse off because of the possibility that the bank will default on the outstanding derivatives, the bank (or the bank’s creditors) must be better off. The reason why this is so is that, in circumstances 
M09_HULL0654_11_GE_C09.indd   217 30/04/2021   16:50218 CHAPTER 9
where it defaults, a bank avoids having to honor its contracts when the no-default value 
of those contracts to the bank is negative.
Without DVA, it is liable to be difficult for derivatives transactions to be agreed to. 
Consider two market participants, X and Y, who are negotiating a bilaterally cleared interest rate swap where X will be paying a fixed rate of interest and receiving LIBOR with no collateral being posted. For the purposes of our example we assume that there are no other trades between these two parties.
1 The two sides agree that, if there is no 
default risk, the fixed rate should be 2.2%. We suppose that, when X takes Y’s default risk into account, it determines it should pay 2.1% rather than 2.2%. (The 0.1% per annum reduction is compensation to X for possibility that Y might default.) But when Y takes X’s default risk into account, it determines that it should receive 2.35% rather than 2.2%. (The extra 0.15% is compensation to Y for the possibility that X might default.) It is easy to see that the two sides are unlikely do a deal if each side considers only the possibility of the other side defaulting. But if each side calculates a DVA  
(recognizing that it might itself default), the two sides will have a better chance of doing a deal because they will value the expected cash flows from the swap similarly.
DVA has a counterintuitive effect. As the bank’s creditworthiness declines, 
q*
i in 
equation (9.2) increases and DVA increases. This makes the derivatives portfolio more valuable to the bank. As the bank’s creditworthiness improves, 
q*
i decreases and DVA 
decreases so that the portfolio is less valuable. Why should the bank gain from a  
worsening of its credit quality? The reason is that as the bank becomes more likely to default it is more likely that it will not have to honor its derivatives obligations.
Collateral
When the agreement between the two parties requires collateral to be posted, the  
situation is more complicated. A credit support annex (CSA) to the master agreement specifies how the required amount of collateral is calculated and what form the  
collateral can take. Interest is normally paid on cash collateral at close to the fed funds rate or similar overnight rate. When the collateral takes the form of securities, a haircut is usually applied to the market value of the securities.
If a bank’s counterparty defaults, the bank is entitled to keep any collateral that has 
been posted by the counterparty if it is less than any settlement amount it is owed. Similarly, if the bank defaults, the counterparty can use any collateral posted by the bank to cover any settlement amount it is owed. Any collateral in excess of the  
settlement amount must be returned.
Equations (9.1) and (9.2) are still correct when collateral is posted, but the calculation 
of 
vi and v*
i is more complicated. The calculation must take into account the collateral 
that would be provided by the bank to the counterparty or by the counterparty to the bank at the time of an early termination. Usually the calculation involves an assumption that the defaulting party will stop posting collateral, and will stop returning excess collateral, several days before the early termination. The number of days assumed here is known as the cure period or margin period of risk. For example, if the cure period is 10 
days, the collateral at the time of the early termination would be assumed to be that specified in the CSA 10 days earlier.
1 When there are other trades and a master agreement covering them is in place, each side should assess 
expected incremental losses arising from the new trade on the portfolio of trades between the two sides.

The funding valuation adjustment (FVA) and margin valuation adjustment (MVA) are 
adjustments to the value of a derivatives portfolio for the cost of funding derivative positions. To illustrate how they might arise, suppose that a derivatives dealer, Bank A, is in the situation illustrated in Figure 9.1. It has entered into a five-year interest rate swap with a corporate end user and has hedged its risk by entering into an exactly offsetting swap with another dealer, Bank B. It appears that Bank A has locked in a profit of 0.1% per year because it receives 3% from Bank B and pays 2.9% to the end user. We suppose that the transaction between Bank A and Bank B is cleared through a CCP with both sides posting initial margin and variation margin. (As explained in earlier chapters, this is required under post-crisis regulations for a standard swap such as this.)
If the transaction with the end user in Figure 9.1 were cleared through the same CCP 
as the transaction between the banks, Bank A’s situation is straightforward. The CCP will net off the two transactions so that they do not lead to any incremental initial  
margin requirement for Bank A. Indeed, because the transactions always give a net positive value to the bank, margin requirements should be slightly less than they would be without the two transactions.
But let us assume that the transaction between Bank A and the end user is cleared 
bilaterally with no collateral being required while, as already mentioned, the transaction between Bank A and Bank B is cleared through a CCP. The transactions do then have some funding implications. First, the swap with Bank B is liable to lead the CCP  
requiring additional initial margin from Bank A during the life of the transaction. If  
we assume that the cost of funding initial margin is greater than the interest paid by the CCP on initial margin there is a cost to Bank A in funding the incremental initial margin attributable to the transaction. This is referred to as a margin valuation adjustment (MVA) and reduces the value to the bank of its transaction with the end user.
2
The CCP’s variation margin can also lead to funding requirements. Suppose that the 
transaction with Bank B has a negative value to Bank A so that the transaction with the end user has a positive value to Bank A. Bank A will have funds tied up in the variation margin it has posted with the CCP.
3 It will not receive any collateral to offset this initial 
margin from the end user. This gives rise to a funding need because Bank A has to increase its funding from external sources. In the opposite situation, where the trans-action with Bank B has a positive value and the transaction with the end user has a negative value, it receives variation margin from the CCP and does not have to provide any collateral or margin to the end user. This gives rise to a source of funding.
We continue to assume that the cost of funding margin is greater than the interest 
paid on it. There is a cost in the first case just considered (Bank A has to increase its funding from external sources) and a benefit in the second case (Bank A can reduce its 9.2 FVA AND MVA
2 The initial margin required by the CCP does not necessarily increase as a result of the transaction. In  
determining initial margin the CCP will look at all the transactions Bank A has that are cleared with the CCP. 
It can be the case that the swap with Bank B partially offsets other transactions that Bank A is clearing through the CCP and the initial margin decreases as a result. The incremental MVA for the transaction is then negative.
3 Remember that, although a CCP is in many ways similar to a futures clearing house, swaps are different 
from futures in that they are not settled daily. Therefore, when Bank A pays variation margin, it receives interest on it and when it receives variation margin it must pay interest on it. In the case of futures, the daily settlement means that the variation margin belongs to the recipient and there is no interest paid on it.
M09_HULL0654_11_GE_C09.indd   219 30/04/2021   16:50220 CHAPTER 9
4 To see how this works in Figure 9.1, note that the swap with the end user is uncollateralized. When it has a 
positive value (and the offsetting deal with the CCP has a negative value), there is a funding cost. When it has 
a negative value (and the offsetting deal with the CCP has a positive value), there is a funding benefit.funding from external sources). FVA is an adjustment to the value of derivatives that 
reflects these costs and benefits. The present value of the expected future funding cost is referred to as the funding cost adjustment (FCA) and the present value of the expected future funding benefit is referred to as the funding benefit adjustment (FBA). The funding value adjustment, FVA, reduces the value of derivatives by the excess of FCA over FBA. Whether there is a positive or negative adjustment to the value of the swaps in Figure 9.1 depends on whether the swap with Bank B is more likely to have a positive or negative value as time passes. This depends on the shape of the term structure of interest rates, as discussed in Section 7.7.
The situation in Figure 9.1 is not the only way FVA and MVA can arise. An FVA 
potentially arises whenever a bank enters into an uncollateralized derivative transaction with a counterparty. When the uncollateralized derivative has a positive value, there is a funding cost. When it has a negative value, there is a funding benefit.
4 For example, if 
the bank buys an uncollateralized option from a counterparty, the option has a positive value and there is a funding cost equal to the excess of the assumed cost of funding over the risk-free rate assumed in the pricing of the option. If the bank sells an uncollater-alized option to the counterparty, the option has a negative value and there is a funding benefit. MVA can arise whenever a transaction gives rise to incremental initial margin requirements. As explained in earlier chapters, rules are being implemented requiring initial margin for bilaterally cleared transactions between financial institutions as well as for those cleared through CCPs.
5
To calculate the MVA or FVA it is necessary to answer the question: “What is the 
cost of funding the margin in a situation such as Figure 9.1?” This is where there is  
often a disagreement between theory and practice. Many banks argue that the cost of funding margin is equal to their average debt funding cost. Suppose the margin is  provided in U.S. dollars.
6 If the interest received by a bank on U.S. dollar margin is the 
federal funds rate minus 20 basis points and a bank’s average funding cost is the federal 
funds rate plus 100 basis points, FVA and MVA would be calculated by these banks on the assumption of a funding cost of 120 basis points per year.
Financial economics argues that the way an investment is funded should not affect 
the required return on the investment. The required return should reflect the riskiness of Figure 9.1 Swaps entered into by Bank A. The transaction with Bank B is cleared 
through a CCP. The transaction with the end user is cleared bilaterally.

5 Also default fund contributions to CCPs can be considered to be akin to initial margin from a funding 
perspective.
6 In practice a bank can choose which currency to post margin in and can in some circumstances post  
securities such as Treasury bills instead of cash. (Securities are typically subject to a haircut in determining 
their value for collateral purposes.) Choosing what is best can involve complex calculations.
M09_HULL0654_11_GE_C09.indd   220 30/04/2021   16:50XVAs 221
the investment. An investment in initial margin or variation margin usually has very 
low risk.7 As such, the bank should be comfortable with a return that is close to the 
risk-free rate. If the return requirement on margin in our example is assumed to be the fed funds rate plus 10 basis points and the interest paid on margin is the federal funds rate minus 20 basis points, then the funding cost (or benefit) is 30 basis points, not the 120 basis points calculated earlier.
To explain why the average funding cost of the fed funds rate plus 100 basis points 
should not be used, Hull and White (2012) use two arguments.
8 The first argument is 
that there is a gain to the bank from the 100 basis points credit spread because it might default on the debt it issues. This is similar to the DVA discussed earlier and is referred to as DVA2 by Hull and White. Because of this benefit, the bank does not have to pass the funding cost on to the derivatives desk.
9
For the second argument, suppose that the risk-free rate is 2% and the bank’s  
funding cost is 3.5%. If a project comes along that is risk-free and provides a return  
of 3%, should the bank undertake it? The answer is that the project should be  
undertaken. The appropriate discount rate for the project’s cash flows is 2% and the project has a positive present value when this discount rate is used. It is not correct to argue that the bank is funding itself at 3.5% and should therefore only undertake  
projects earning more than 3.5%.
Consider what happens as the bank enters into projects that are risk-free (or nearly 
risk-free). Its funding costs should come down in such a way that the incremental costs of funding a risk-free project should be 2%, not 3.5%. To take an extreme example, suppose that the bank we are considering were to double in size by undertaking entirely risk-free projects. The bank’s funding cost should change to 2.75% (an average of 3.5% for the old projects and 2% for the new projects). If the average funding cost of 3.5% is used as the required return for all projects, low-risk projects will tend to seem  
unattractive and high-risk projects will tend to seem attractive.
Andersen et al. (2016) also question the use of average funding costs in calculating 
FVA. They consider the situation where debtholders do not anticipate the investment in margin that will be made by the bank and are pleasantly surprised because it leads to the bank becoming less risky.
10 There is then a transfer of wealth from the shareholders 
to the debtholders.
The XVA debate has an interesting analogy. In a first corporate finance course, 
students learn how to calculate a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for a  
(nonfinancial) corporation and how the discount rate used for the expected cash flows of a capital investment project should be calculated. They learn that the discount rate should depend on the risk of the project, not how it is financed. For projects that are more risky than average, the discount rate should be higher than the WACC. For  
projects that are less risky than average, the discount rate should be lower than  
the WACC.
7 For instance, in the example in Figure 9.1 there might be a very small chance of margin being lost because 
of a failure of the CCP.
8 See J. C. Hull and A. White, “The FVA Debate,” Risk, 25th anniversary edition (July 2012): 83–85.
9 However, if part of the 100 basis points is for liquidity or other things that are not reflective of the default 
risk of the bank, this is a deadweight cost of doing business and could be a valid source of FVA.
10 See L. B. G. Andersen, D. Duffie, and Y. Song, “Funding Value Adjustments,” Working Paper,  
SSRN 2746010.
M09_HULL0654_11_GE_C09.indd   221 30/04/2021   16:50222 CHAPTER 9
11 In practice, capital requirements (like margin requirements) vary through time. Also, the expected  
incremental capital required at any given time has a number of components: credit risk capital, market risk 
capital, and operational risk capital. These must be estimated separately.But many companies use a single discount rate for all projects. This tends to make 
risky projects more attractive than they should be and safe projects less attractive than 
they should be. With all else equal, the use of a single discount rate leads to companies becoming more risky over time.
The XVA analogy is that many of a bank’s investments that we are concerned with 
when considering FVA and MVA are lower-than-average-risk investments. An invest-ment in initial margin or variation margin is usually low risk compared with other things the bank does. As such, its marginal effect is to lower the average cost of the bank’s funding.
The difference between the views of some financial engineers and financial economists 
on FVA and MVA is that financial economists work with marginal funding costs while the financial engineers work with average costs. The essence of the debate can be  summarized by the following imaginary dialogue:
Financial Economist:   The cost you should use for funding a project should reflect 
the risk of the project. By using average funding costs you are assuming that all the bank’s projects are equally risky.
    Financial Engineer:  But tying up funds in initial margin or a low-risk hedged 
derivatives position prevents me from using the funds else-where. On average the bank gets a much higher return than it does on things like initial margin. There is a cost to low-risk, low-return projects.
Financial Economist:   You talk as though funds for your business are in short supply. If you have good projects, whether they are low risk or high risk, the market will provide funding for you.
    Financial Engineer: I am not sure that is how things work in practice.
KVA, capital valuation adjustment, is a charge to a derivatives transaction for the 
incremental capital requirements that the transaction gives rise to. Suppose that as a result of entering into a particular transaction a bank calculates that regulations require it to hold an extra $1 million of equity capital throughout the life of the transaction.
11 
What is the cost of this?
Again there is a divergence between between financial economics theory and the 
opinions of many practitioners. Many practitioners would argue that if equity share-holders require a return of 15% per annum and a bank invests in a low-risk project that will require additional equity capital, the return on the additional capital should be at least 15%. (This is similar to nonfinancial companies using WACC as a hurdle rate for all projects, as discussed earlier.) In the derivatives context this means that there should be a price adjustment, a KVA, to ensure that the return on the incremental equity capital is 15%. Financial economists argue that how a company is financed should not affect how it evaluates projects (except possibly for tax effects). As a bank uses more 9.3 KVA
M09_HULL0654_11_GE_C09.indd   222 30/04/2021   16:50XVAs 223
equity to finance itself, it becomes less risky and the providers of both debt and equity  
capital require a lower return. This argument is over 50 years old in the finance 
 literature and so its theoretical validity has stood the test of time.12 Many practitioners 
disagree with the theory. As in the case of MVA and FVA the difference between the 
two sides is whether average or marginal capital costs should be used. We can imagine the following dialogue:
Financial Economist:  You do not need to make a KVA. As long as a derivatives book provides a return reflecting its risk your investors will be happy.
 Practitioner:  Equity capital requirements for derivatives have gone up since the crisis. My equity investors require a 15% per annum return. If I enter into a derivatives transaction that requires additional capital under the new regulations, I need to make sure that the return on that capital is at least 15%.
Financial Economist:  But as more of the bank is financed by equity capital it becomes less risky and the return required by equity in -vestors goes down. This is true even if the average risk of the whole bank does not change. So the marginal return required on new equity capital is low.
 Practitioner: I am not sure that is how things work in practice.
All of the XVAs are computationally time-consuming to calculate. Monte Carlo  
simulations are necessary to determine expected credit exposures, expected funding costs, and expected capital requirements at future times. CVA is often actively managed by banks. They sometimes buy protection against their counterparties defaulting using credit default swaps (see Section 7.12 and Chapter 25) or similar instruments. This reduces their expected losses from defaults.
As discussed in Section 9.1, CVA and DVA must be calculated on the whole  
portfolio of derivatives that a bank has with a counterparty. It cannot be calculated  
on a transaction-by-transaction basis. This is because of the impact of netting. A new bilaterally cleared transaction with a counterparty will increase or decrease CVA and DVA depending on what happens when it is netted with other transactions that have been entered into with the counterparty. If it tends to increase credit exposure for the bank in the future, the incremental CVA will be positive; if it tends to decrease credit exposure in the future, the incremental CVA will decrease. Similarly for DVA.
The incremental FVA can be calculated on a transaction-by-transaction basis. This is 
because the net funding required for a portfolio of transactions at any future time is the sum of that for the individual transactions.

CCP has to be calculated on a portfolio basis. In the case of the example in Figure 9.1, it 
is the impact of a new transaction on the initial margin required by the CCP for portfolio that Bank A is clearing through the CCP that determines the incremental initial margin requirements and therefore MVA. KVA is even more complicated. The rules used by regulators are such that a bank must in theory sometimes model the bank’s whole  portfolio when calculating incremental capital requirements.
Application of Machine Learning
Because the calculation of XVAs is computationally quite time-consuming, some banks 
are using machine learning to get faster results. They are particularly interested in being able to quickly answer queries about the incremental effect of a proposed new  
transaction on the XVAs. A neural network is a tool that can be used to do this. It  
is a flexible algorithm that can learn any continuous relationship between the value of a target variable (the output) and the values of features (the inputs) when a huge volume of data is available. Once the network has been constructed, calculating the target from the features is very fast.
To create a neural network to calculate incremental XVAs, an analyst randomly 
creates many different data sets that are inputs to the calculation. (The data set will include features describing the proposed new transaction and features describing  
relevant aspects of existing trades with the counterparty.) Monte Carlo simulation is used to calculate the XVAs for each data set and an algorithm is used to find a neural network that replicates the Monte Carlo calculations as accurately as possible.
SUMMARY
Banks and other derivatives market participants have for many years been concerned about counterparty credit risk. Two adjustments are the credit valuation adjustment (CVA) and debt or debit valuation adjustment (DVA). CVA is an adjustment by a bank for the possibility that its counterparty will default and it reduces the value of the  
derivatives portfolio it has with the counterparty. DVA is an adjustment for the  
possibility that the bank will default and it increases the value of the derivatives  
portfolio. There is no real argument about whether these adjustments should be made, but many people are less comfortable with DVA than CVA. Why should a bank benefit from the possibility that it will itself default? As the probability of a default increases, the benefit increases.
The funding valuation adjustment (FVA) is an adjustment to the value of a  
derivatives position arising from the funding required (or the funding generated) by  
a derivatives transaction. The margin valuation adjustment (MVA) quantifies the cost of funding initial margin. The capital valuation adjustment (KVA) is a valuation  
adjustment reflecting the impact of a derivatives position on capital requirements. Finance theory argues that the way a project is funded should not influence its  
valuation. In particular, the current average debt and equity costs should not be  
assumed to be the same as the incremental effect of a new transaction on funding  
costs. In spite of this, many banks do calculate MVA, FVA, and KVA based on these average costs.

Practice Questions
 9.1. Explain the difference between the views of financial economists and most practitioners 
on how MVA and FVA should be calculated.
 9.2. Explain the difference between the views of financial economists and most practitioners on how KVA should be calculated.
 9.3. Explain why FVA can be calculated for a transaction without considering the portfolio to which the transaction belongs, but that the same is not true of MVA.
 9.4. Suppose that a bank buys an option from a client. The option is uncollateralized and  
there are no other transactions outstanding with the client. The expected values of the option at the midpoint of years 1, 2, and 3 are 6, 5, and 4. The probability of the  
counterparty defaulting in each of the three years is 3%. The probability of the bank defaulting in each of the three years is 2%. Estimate the bank’s CVA and DVA for the transaction. Assume no recovery in the event of a default and zero interest rates.
 9.5. “The impact of DVA on earnings volatility is generally greater than that of CVA.”  
Explain this statement.
 9.6. A company is trying to decide between issuing debt and equity to fulfill a funding need. What in theory should happen to the return required by equity holders if it chooses  
(a) debt and (b) equity?
 9.7 . Explain the meaning of “netting”. Suppose no collateral is posted. Why does a netting agreement usually reduce credit risks to both sides? Under what circumstances does  
netting have no effect on credit risk?
 9.8. The average funding cost for a company is 5% per annum when the risk-free rate is 3%. The company is currently undertaking projects worth $9 million. It plans to increase its size by undertaking $1 million of risk-free projects. What would you expect to happen to its average funding cost?

We introduced options in Chapter 1. This chapter explains how options markets are 
organized, what terminology is used, how the contracts are traded, how margin  
requirements are set, and so on. Later chapters will examine such topics as trading strategies involving options, the determination of option prices, and the ways in which portfolios of options can be hedged. This chapter is concerned primarily with stock options. It also presents some introductory material on currency options, index options, and futures options. More details concerning these instruments can be found in  
Chapters 17 and 18.
Options are fundamentally different from forward and futures contracts. An option 
gives the holder of the option the right to do something, but the holder does not have to exercise this right. By contrast, in a forward or futures contract, the two parties have committed themselves to some action. It costs a trader nothing (except for the margin/ collateral requirements) to enter into a forward or futures contract, whereas the  
purchase of an option requires an up-front payment.
When charts showing the gain or loss from options trading are produced, the usual 
practice is to ignore the time value of money, so that the profit is the final payoff minus the initial cost. This chapter follows this practice.Mechanics of 
Options Markets10 CHAPTER  
As mentioned in Chapter 1, there are two types of options. A call option gives the holder of the option the right to buy an asset by a certain date for a certain price. A put option gives the holder the right to sell an asset by a certain date for a certain price. The date specified in the contract is known as the expiration date or the maturity date.  
The price specified in the contract is known as the exercise price or the strike price.
Options can be either American or European, a distinction that has nothing to do 
with geographical location. American options can be exercised at any time up to the expiration date, whereas European options can be exercised only on the expiration date itself. Most of the options that are traded on exchanges are American. However, European options are generally easier to analyze than American options, and some of the properties of an American option are frequently deduced from those of its European counterpart.10.1 TYPES OF OPTIONS
M10_HULL0654_11_GE_C10.indd   227 30/04/2021   16:50228 CHAPTER 10
Call Options
Consider the situation of an investor who buys a European call option with a strike 
price of $100 to purchase 100 shares of a certain stock. Suppose that the current stock price is $98, the expiration date of the option is in 4 months, and the price of an option to purchase one share is $5. The initial investment is $500. Because the option is  
European, the investor can exercise only on the expiration date. If the stock price on this date is less than $100, the investor will clearly choose not to exercise. (There is no point in buying for $100 a share that has a market value of less than $100.) In these  
circumstances, the investor loses the whole of the initial investment of $500. If the stock price is above $100 on the expiration date, the option will be exercised. Suppose, for example, that the stock price is $115. By exercising the option, the investor is able to buy 100 shares for $100 per share. If the shares are sold immediately, the investor makes a gain of $15 per share, or $1,500, ignoring transaction costs. When the initial cost of the option is taken into account, the net profit to the investor is $1,000.
Figure 10.1 shows how the investor’s net profit or loss on an option to purchase one 
share varies with the final stock price in this example. For instance, when the final stock price is $120 the profit from an option to purchase one share is $15. It is important to realize that an investor sometimes exercises an option and makes a loss overall. Suppose that, in the example, the stock price is $102 at the expiration of the option. The investor would exercise for a gain of 
$102-$100=$2 per option and realize a loss overall of $3 
when the initial cost of the option is taken into account. It is tempting to argue that the investor should not exercise the option in these circumstances. However, not exercising would lead to a loss of $5, which is worse than the $3 loss when the investor exercises. In general, call options should always be exercised at the expiration date if the stock price is above the strike price.
Put Options
Whereas the purchaser of a call option is hoping that the stock price will increase, the purchaser of a put option is hoping that it will decrease. Consider an investor who  Profit ($)

buys a European put option with a strike price of $70 to sell 100 shares of a certain 
stock. Suppose that the current stock price is $65, the expiration date of the option is in 3 months, and the price of an option to sell one share is $7. The initial investment is $700. Because the option is European, it will be exercised only if the stock price is below $70 on the expiration date. Suppose that the stock price is $55 on this date. The investor can buy 100 shares for $55 per share and, under the terms of the put option, sell the same shares for $70 to realize a gain of $15 per share, or $1,500. (Again,  
transaction costs are ignored.) When the $700 initial cost of the option is taken into account, the investor’s net profit is $800. There is no guarantee that the investor will make a gain. If the final stock price is above $70, the put option expires worthless, and the investor loses $700. Figure 10.2 shows the way in which the investor’s profit or loss on an option to sell one share varies with the terminal stock price in this example.
Early Exercise
As mentioned earlier, exchange-traded stock options are usually American rather than European. This means that the investor in the foregoing examples would not have to wait until the expiration date before exercising the option. We will see later that there are some circumstances when it is optimal to exercise American options before the expiration date.Profit ($)

There are two sides to every option contract. On one side is the investor who has taken 
the long position (i.e., has bought the option). On the other side is the investor who has taken a short position (i.e., has sold or written the option). The writer of an option receives cash up front, but has potential liabilities later. The writer’s profit or loss is the reverse of that for the purchaser of the option. Figures 10.3 and 10.4 show the variation of the profit or loss with the final stock price for writers of the options considered in Figures 10.1 and 10.2.10.2 OPTION POSITIONS
M10_HULL0654_11_GE_C10.indd   229 30/04/2021   16:50230 CHAPTER 10
There are four types of option positions:
1. A long position in a call option
2. A long position in a put option
3. A short position in a call option
4. A short position in a put option.
It is often useful to characterize a European option in terms of its payoff to the  
purchaser of the option. The initial cost of the option is then not included in the  
calculation. If K  is the strike price and ST is the final price of the underlying asset, the Profit ($)

This section provides a first look at how options on stocks, currencies, stock indices, 
and futures are traded on exchanges.10.3 UNDERLYING ASSETS
M10_HULL0654_11_GE_C10.indd   231 30/04/2021   16:50232 CHAPTER 10
Stock Options
Most trading in stock options is on exchanges. In the United States, the exchanges 
include the Chicago Board Options Exchange (www.cboe.com), NYSE Euronext (www.euronext.com), which acquired the American Stock Exchange in 2008, the Inter -
national Securities Exchange (www.ise.com), and the Boston Options Exchange (www.bostonoptions.com). Options trade on several thousand different stocks. One contract gives the holder the right to buy or sell 100 shares at the specified strike price. This contract size is convenient because the shares themselves are usually traded in lots of 100.
ETP Options
The CBOE trades options on many exchange-traded products (ETPs). ETPs are listed on an exchange and traded like a share of a company’s stock. They are designed to replicate the performance of a particular market, often by tracking an underlying benchmark index. ETPs are sometimes also referred to a exchange-traded vehicles (ETVs). The most common ETP is an exchange-traded fund (ETF). This is usually designed to track an equity index or a bond index. For example, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF trust is designed to provide investors with the return they would earn if they invested in the 500 stocks that constitute the S&P 500 index. Other ETPs are designed to track the performance of  
commodities or currencies.
Foreign Currency Options
Most currency options trading is now in the over-the-counter market, but there is some exchange trading. Exchanges trading foreign currency options in the United States include NASDAQ OMX (www.nasdaqtrader.com), which acquired the Philadelphia Stock Exchange in 2008. This exchange offers European-style contracts on a variety of different currencies. One contract is to buy or sell 10,000 units of a foreign currency (1,000,000 units in the case of the Japanese yen) for U.S. dollars. Foreign currency options contracts are discussed further in Chapter 17.
Index Options
Many different index options currently trade throughout the world in both the over-the-counter market and the exchange-traded market. The most popular exchange-traded contracts in the United States are those on the S&P 500 Index (SPX), the S&P 100 Index (OEX), the Nasdaq-100 Index (NDX), and the Dow Jones Industrial Index (DJX). All of these trade on the Chicago Board Options Exchange. Most of the contracts are  
European. An exception is the OEX contract on the S&P 100, which is American. One contract is usually to buy or sell 100 times the index at the specified strike price.  
Settlement is always in cash, rather than by delivering the portfolio underlying the index. Consider, for example, one call contract on an index with a strike price of 980. If it is exercised when the value of the index is 992, the writer of the contract pays the holder 
1992-9802*100=$1,200. Index options are discussed further in Chapter 17.
Futures Options
When an exchange trades a particular futures contract, it often also trades American options on that contract. The life of a futures option normally ends a short period of time 
M10_HULL0654_11_GE_C10.indd   232 30/04/2021   16:50Mechanics of Options Markets 233
before the expiration of trading in the underlying futures contract. When a call option is 
exercised, the holder’s gain equals the excess of the futures price over the strike price. When a put option is exercised, the holder’s gain equals the excess of the strike price over the futures price. Futures options contracts are discussed further in Chapter 18.
In the rest of this chapter, we will focus on stock options. As already mentioned, a 
standard exchange-traded stock option in the United States is an American-style option contract to buy or sell 100 shares of the stock. Details of the contract (the expiration date, the strike price, what happens when dividends are declared, how large a position investors can hold, and so on) are specified by the exchange.
Expiration Dates
One of the items used to describe a stock option is the month in which the expiration date occurs. Thus, a January call trading on IBM is a call option on IBM with an expiration date in January. The precise expiration date is the third Friday of the  
expiration month and trading takes place every business day (8:30 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., Chicago time) until the expiration date.
Stock options in the United States are on a January, February, or March cycle. The 
January cycle consists of the months of January, April, July, and October. The  
February cycle consists of the months of February, May, August, and November.  
The March cycle consists of the months of March, June, September, and December. If the expiration date for the current month has not yet been reached, options trade with expiration dates in the current month, the following month, and the next two months in the cycle. If the expiration date of the current month has passed, options trade with expiration dates in the next month, the next-but-one month, and the next two months of the expiration cycle. Consider, for example, an option on a January cycle. At the  
beginning of January, options are traded with expiration dates in January, February, April, and July; at the end of January, they are traded with expiration dates in February, March, April, and July; at the beginning of May, they are traded with expiration dates in May, June, July, and October; and so on. When one option reaches expiration, trading in another is started. When there is a great deal of interest in a company, options  
expiring in other months may trade. Also, options expiring on Fridays other than the third Friday of a month sometimes trade. The latter are known as weekly’s.
Longer-term options, known as LEAPS (long-term equity anticipation securities), 
also trade on many stocks in the United States. These have expiration dates up to 39 months into the future. The expiration dates for LEAPS on stocks are always the third Friday of a January.
Strike Prices
The exchange normally chooses the strike prices at which options can be written so that they are spaced $2.50, $5, or $10 apart. Typically the spacing is $2.50 when the stock price is between $5 and $25, $5 when the stock price is between $25 and $200, and  10.4 SPECIFICATION OF STOCK OPTIONS
M10_HULL0654_11_GE_C10.indd   233 30/04/2021   16:50234 CHAPTER 10
$10 for stock prices above $200. As will be explained shortly, stock splits and stock 
dividends can lead to nonstandard strike prices.
Terminology
For any given asset at any given time, many different option contracts may be trading. Suppose there are four expiration dates and five strike prices for options on a particular stock. If call and put options trade with every expiration date and every strike price, there are a total of 40 different contracts. All options of the same type (calls or puts) on a stock are referred to as an option class. For example, IBM calls are one class, whereas IBM puts are another class. An option series consists of all the options of a given class with the same expiration date and strike price. In other words, it refers to a particular contract that is traded. For example, IBM 160 October 2021 calls would constitute an option series.
Options are referred to as in the money, at the money, or out of the money. If S is the 
stock price and K is the strike price, a call option is in the money when 
S7K, at the 
money when S=K, and out of the money when S6K. A put option is in the money 
when S6K, at the money when S=K, and out of the money when S7K. Clearly, an 
option will be exercised only when it is in the money. In the absence of transaction  
costs, an in-the-money option will always be exercised on the expiration date if it has not been exercised previously.
1
The intrinsic value of an option is defined as the value it would have if there were no 
time to maturity, so that the exercise decision had to be made immediately. For a call option, the intrinsic value is therefore 
max1S-K, 02. For a put option, it is 
max1K-S, 02. An in-the-money American option must be worth at least as much as 
its intrinsic value because the holder has the right to exercise it immediately. Often it is optimal for the holder of an in-the-money American option to wait rather than exercise immediately. The excess of an option’s value over its intrinsic value is the option’s time value. The total value of an option is therefore the sum of its intrinsic value and its time value.
FLEX Options
The Chicago Board Options Exchange offers FLEX (short for flexible) options on equities and equity indices. These are options where the traders agree to nonstandard terms. These nonstandard terms can involve a strike price or an expiration date that is different from what is usually offered by the exchange. They can also involve the option being European when it is normally American or vice versa. FLEX options are an attempt by option exchanges to regain business from the over-the-counter markets. The exchange specifies a minimum size (e.g., 100 contracts) for FLEX option trades.
Dividends and Stock Splits
The early over-the-counter options were dividend protected. If a company declared a cash dividend, the strike price for options on the company’s stock was reduced on the ex-dividend day by the amount of the dividend. Exchange-traded options are not  
1 Section 20.4 provides alternative definitions, often used by traders, for in the money, out of the money, and 
at the money.
M10_HULL0654_11_GE_C10.indd   234 30/04/2021   16:50Mechanics of Options Markets 235
usually adjusted for cash dividends. In other words, when a cash dividend occurs, there 
are no adjustments to the terms of the option contract. An exception is sometimes made for large cash dividends. When a dividend greater than 10% of the stock price is declared, a committee of the Options Clearing Corporation at the CBOE can decide to adjust the terms of call and put options on the stock. Typically the effect of the  
adjustment is to reduce the strike price by the amount of the dividend.
Exchange-traded options are adjusted for stock splits. A stock split occurs when the 
existing shares are “split” into more shares. For example, in a 3-for-1 stock split, three new shares are issued to replace each existing share. Because a stock split does not change the assets or the earning ability of a company, we should not expect it to have any effect on the wealth of the company’s shareholders. All else being equal, the 3-for-1 stock split should cause the stock price to go down to one-third of its previous value. In general, an n-for-m stock split should cause the stock price to go down to 
m>n of its previous value. 
The terms of option contracts are adjusted to reflect expected changes in a stock price arising from a stock split. After an n-for-m stock split, the strike price is reduced to 
m>n 
of its previous value, and the number of shares covered by one contract is increased to 
n>m of its previous value. If the stock price declines in the way expected, the positions of 
both the writer and the purchaser of a contract remain unchanged.
Example 10.1
Consider a call option to buy 100 shares of a company for $30 per share. Suppose 
the company makes a 2-for-1 stock split. The terms of the option contract are then changed so that it gives the holder the right to purchase 200 shares for  
$15 per share.
Stock options are adjusted for stock dividends. A stock dividend involves a company issuing more shares to its existing shareholders. For example, a 20% stock dividend means that investors receive one new share for each five already owned. A stock dividend, like a stock split, has no effect on either the assets or the earning power of a company. The stock price can be expected to go down as a result of a stock dividend. The 20% stock dividend referred to is essentially the same as a 6-for-5 stock split. All else being equal, it should cause the stock price to decline to 5>6 of its previous value. The terms of an option are adjusted to reflect the expected price decline arising from a stock dividend in the same way as they are for that arising from a stock split.
Example 10.2
Consider a put option to sell 100 shares of a company for $15 per share. Suppose 
the company declares a 25% stock dividend. This is equivalent to a 5-for-4 stock split. The terms of the option contract are changed so that it gives the holder the right to sell 125 shares for $12.
Adjustments are also made for rights issues. The basic procedure is to calculate the theoretical price of the rights and then to reduce the strike price by this amount.
Position Limits and Exercise Limits
The Chicago Board Options Exchange often specifies a position limit for option con-tracts. This defines the maximum number of option contracts that an investor can hold on one side of the market. For this purpose, long calls and short puts are considered to be on the same side of the market. Also considered to be on the same side are short calls and

long puts. The exercise limit usually equals the position limit. It defines the maximum 
number of contracts that can be exercised by any individual (or group of individuals acting together) in any period of five consecutive business days. Options on the largest and most frequently traded stocks have positions limits of 250,000 contracts. Smaller capitalization stocks have position limits of 200,000, 75,000, 50,000, or 25,000 contracts.
Position limits and exercise limits are designed to prevent the market from being 
unduly influenced by the activities of an individual investor or group of investors.  
However, whether the limits are really necessary is a controversial issue.
Traditionally, exchanges have had to provide a large open area for individuals to meet 
and trade options. This has changed. Most derivatives exchanges are fully electronic, so traders do not have to physically meet. The International Securities Exchange (www.ise.com) launched the first all-electronic options market for equities in the United States in May 2000. Over 95% of the orders at the Chicago Board Options Exchange are handled electronically. The remainder are mostly large or complex  
institutional orders that require the skills of traders.
Market Makers
Most options exchanges use market makers to facilitate trading. A market maker for a certain option is an individual who, when asked to do so, will quote both a bid and an ask price on the option. The bid is the price at which the market maker is prepared to buy, and the ask (or offer) is the price at which the market maker is prepared to sell. At the time the bid and ask prices are quoted, the market maker does not know whether the trader who asked for the quotes wants to buy or sell the option. The ask is always higher than the bid, and the amount by which the ask exceeds the bid is referred to as the bid–ask spread. The exchange sets upper limits for the bid–ask spread. For example, 
it might specify that the spread be no more than $0.25 for options priced at less than $0.50, $0.50 for options priced between $0.50 and $10, $0.75 for options priced between $10 and $20, and $1 for options priced over $20.
The existence of the market maker ensures that buy and sell orders can always be 
executed at some price without any delays. Market makers therefore add liquidity to the market. The market makers themselves make their profits from the bid–ask spread. They use methods such as those that will be discussed in Chapter 19 to hedge their risks.
Offsetting Orders
An investor who has purchased options can close out the position by issuing an offsetting order to sell the same number of options. Similarly, an investor who has written options can close out the position by issuing an offsetting order to buy the same number of options. (In this respect options markets are similar to futures markets.) If, when an option contract is traded, neither investor is closing an existing position, the open interest increases by one contract. If one investor is closing an existing position and the other is not, the open interest stays the same. If both investors are closing existing positions, the open interest goes down by one contract.10.5 TRADING
M10_HULL0654_11_GE_C10.indd   236 30/04/2021   16:50Mechanics of Options Markets 237
The types of orders that can be placed with a broker for options trading are similar to 
those for futures trading (see Section 2.8). A market order is executed immediately, a limit order specifies the least favorable price at which the order can be executed, and so on.
When options are traded online, the broker will typically charge a fixed fee plus a per-  
contract fee. For example, the base fee might be $2.50 and the per-contract fee $0.50. There is also typically a fee charged for exercising an option, and an assignment fee when a trader is short an option and is the subject of an exercise. Sometimes it is cheaper to sell an option than pay the fee for exercising it. (See www.stockbrokers.com/guides  
/features-fees to compare the fees charged by 16 U.S. brokers.)
A hidden cost in option trading (and in many other financial transactions) is the 
market maker’s bid–ask spread. Suppose that, in the example just considered, the bid price was $4.00 and the ask price was $4.50 at the time the option was purchased. We can reasonably assume that a “fair” price for the option is halfway between the bid and the ask price, or $4.25. The cost to the buyer and to the seller of the market maker system is the difference between the fair price and the price paid. This is $0.25 per option, or $25 per contract.10.6 TRADING COSTS
We discussed margin requirements for futures contracts in Chapter 2. The purpose of margin is to provide a guarantee that the entity providing margin will live up to its obligations. If a trader buys an asset such as a stock or an option for cash there is no margin requirement. This is because the trade does not give rise to future obligations. As discussed in Section 5.2, if the trader shorts a stock, margin is required because the trader then has the obligation to close out the position by buying the stock at some future time. Similarly, when the trader sells (i.e., writes) an option, margin is required because the trader has obligations in the event that the option is exercised.
Assets are not always purchased for cash. For example, when shares are purchased in 
the United States, an investor can borrow up to 50% of the price from the broker. This is known as buying on margin. If the share price declines so that the loan is substantially more than 50% of the stock’s current value, there is a “margin call” , where the broker requests that cash be deposited by the investor. If the margin call is not met, the broker sells the stock.
When call and put options with maturities less than 9 months are purchased, the 
option price must be paid in full. Investors are not allowed to buy these options on margin because options already contain substantial leverage and buying on margin would raise this leverage to an unacceptable level. For options with maturities greater than 9 months investors can buy on margin, borrowing up to 25% of the option value.
Writing Naked Options
As mentioned, a trader who writes options is required to maintain funds in a margin account. Both the trader’s broker and the exchange want to be satisfied that the trader will not default if the option is exercised. The amount of margin required depends on the trader’s position.10.7 MARGIN REQUIREMENTS
M10_HULL0654_11_GE_C10.indd   237 30/04/2021   16:50238 CHAPTER 10
A naked option is an option that is not combined with an offsetting position in the 
underlying stock. The initial and maintenance margin required by the CBOE for a 
written naked call option is the greater of the following two calculations:
1. A total of 100% of the proceeds of the sale plus 20% of the underlying share price less the amount, if any, by which the option is out of the money
2. A total of 100% of the option proceeds plus 10% of the underlying share price.
For a written naked put option, it is the greater of
1. A total of 100% of the proceeds of the sale plus 20% of the underlying share price less the amount, if any, by which the option is out of the money
2. A total of 100% of the option proceeds plus 10% of the exercise price.
The 20% in the preceding calculations is replaced by 15% for options on a broadly based stock index because a stock index is usually less volatile than the price of an individual stock.
Example 10.3
An investor writes four naked call option contracts on a stock. The option price is 
$5, the strike price is $40, and the stock price is $38. Because the option is $2 out of the money, the first calculation gives
400*15+0.2*38-22=$4,240
The second calculation gives
400*15+0.1*382=$3,520
The initial margin requirement is therefore $4,240. Note that, if the option had been a put, it would be $2 in the money and the margin requirement would be
400*15+0.2*382=$5,040
In both cases, the proceeds of the sale can be used to form part of the margin account.
A calculation similar to the initial margin calculation (but with the current market price of the contract replacing the proceeds of sale) is repeated every day. Funds can be withdrawn from the margin account when the calculation indicates that the margin required is less than the current balance in the margin account. When the calculation indicates that a greater margin is required, a margin call will be made.
Other Rules
In Chapter 12, we will examine option trading strategies such as covered calls, protective puts, spreads, combinations, straddles, and strangles. The CBOE has special rules for determining the margin requirements when these trading strategies are used. These are described in the CBOE Margin Manual, which is available on the CBOE website  
(www.cboe.com).
As an example of the rules, consider an investor who writes a covered call. This is a 
written call option when the shares that might have to be delivered are already owned. 
M10_HULL0654_11_GE_C10.indd   238 30/04/2021   16:50Mechanics of Options Markets 239
Covered calls are far less risky than naked calls, because the worst that can happen is 
that the investor is required to sell shares already owned at below their market value. No margin is required on the written option. However, the investor can borrow an amount equal to 0.5 min(S, K ), rather than the usual 0.5S, on the stock position.
2 The margin requirements described in the previous section are the minimum requirements specified by the 
OCC. A broker may require a higher margin from its clients. However, it cannot require a lower margin. 
Some brokers do not allow their retail clients to write uncovered options at all.The Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) performs much the same function for options 
markets as the clearing house does for futures markets (see Chapter 2). It guarantees that options writers will fulfill their obligations under the terms of options contracts and keeps a record of all long and short positions. The OCC has a number of members, and all option trades must be cleared through a member. If a broker is not itself a member of an exchange’s OCC, it must arrange to clear its trades with a member. Members are required to have a certain minimum amount of capital and to contribute to a special fund that can be used if any member defaults on an option obligation.
The funds used to purchase an option must be deposited with the OCC by the 
morning of the business day following the trade. The writer of the option maintains a margin account with a broker, as described earlier.
2 The broker maintains a margin 
account with the OCC member that clears its trades. The OCC member in turn  
maintains a margin account with the OCC.
Exercising an Option
When an investor instructs a broker to exercise an option, the broker notifies the OCC member that clears its trades. This member then places an exercise order with the OCC. The OCC randomly selects a member with an outstanding short position in the same option. The member, using a procedure established in advance, selects a particular investor who has written the option. If the option is a call, this investor is required to sell stock at the strike price. If it is a put, the investor is required to buy stock at the strike price. The investor is said to be assigned. The buy/sell transaction takes place on the third business day following the exercise order. When an option is exercised, the open interest goes down by one.
At the expiration of the option, all in-the-money options should be exercised unless 
the transaction costs are so high as to wipe out the payoff from the option. Some  
brokers will automatically exercise options for a client at expiration when it is in their client’s interest to do so. Many exchanges also have rules for exercising options that are in the money at expiration.10.8 THE OPTIONS CLEARING CORPORATION
Exchange-traded options markets are regulated in a number of different ways. Both the exchange and Options Clearing Corporations have rules governing the behavior of 10.9 REGULATION
M10_HULL0654_11_GE_C10.indd   239 30/04/2021   16:50240 CHAPTER 10
traders. In addition, there are both federal and state regulatory authorities. In general, 
options markets have demonstrated a willingness to regulate themselves. There have been no major scandals or defaults by OCC members. Investors can have a high level of confidence in the way the market is run.
The Securities and Exchange Commission is responsible for regulating options 
markets in stocks, stock indices, currencies, and bonds at the federal level. The  
Commodity Futures Trading Commission is responsible for regulating markets for options on futures. The major options markets are in the states of Illinois and  
New York. These states actively enforce their own laws on unacceptable trading  
practices.
Determining the tax implications of option trading strategies can be tricky, and an 
investor who is in doubt about this should consult a tax specialist. In the United States, the general rule is that (unless the taxpayer is a professional trader) gains and losses from the trading of stock options are taxed as capital gains or losses. The way that  
capital gains and losses are taxed in the United States was discussed in Section 2.10. For both the holder and the writer of a stock option, a gain or loss is recognized when (a) the option expires unexercised or (b) the option position is closed out. If the option is exercised, the gain or loss from the option is rolled into the position taken in the stock and recognized when the stock position is closed out. For example, when a call option is exercised, the party with a long position is deemed to have purchased the stock at the strike price plus the call price. This is then used as a basis for calculating this party’s gain or loss when the stock is eventually sold. Similarly, the party with the short call position is deemed to have sold the stock at the strike price plus the call price. When a put option is exercised, the seller of the option is deemed to have bought the stock for the strike price less the original put price and the purchaser of the option is deemed to have sold the stock for the strike price less the original put price.
Wash Sale Rule
One tax consideration in option trading in the United States is the wash sale rule. To understand this rule, imagine an investor who buys a stock when the price is $60 and plans to keep it for the long term. If the stock price drops to $40, the investor might be tempted to sell the stock and then immediately repurchase it, so that the $20 loss is realized for tax purposes. To prevent this practice, the tax authorities have ruled that when the repurchase is within 30 days of the sale (i.e., between 30 days before the sale and 30 days after the sale), any loss on the sale is not deductible. The disallowance also applies where, within the 61 -day period, the taxpayer enters into an option or similar contract to acquire the stock. Thus, selling a stock at a loss and buying a call option within a 30-day period will lead to the loss being disallowed.
Constructive Sales
Prior to 1997, if a United States taxpayer shorted a security while holding a long position in a substantially identical security, no gain or loss was recognized until the 10.10   TAXATION
M10_HULL0654_11_GE_C10.indd   240 30/04/2021   16:50Mechanics of Options Markets 241
short position was closed out. This means that short positions could be used to defer 
recognition of a gain for tax purposes. The situation was changed by the Tax Relief Act of 1997. An appreciated property is now treated as “constructively sold” when the owner does one of the following:
1. Enters into a short sale of the same or substantially identical property
2. Enters into a futures or forward contract to deliver the same or substantially 
identical property
3. Enters into one or more positions that eliminate substantially all of the loss and 
opportunity for gain.
It should be noted that transactions reducing only the risk of loss or only the opportun-ity for gain should not result in constructive sales. Therefore an investor holding a long position in a stock can buy in-the-money put options on the stock without triggering a constructive sale.
Tax practitioners sometimes use options to minimize tax costs or maximize tax 
benefits (see Business Snapshot 10.1). Tax authorities in many jurisdictions have  
proposed legislation designed to combat the use of derivatives for tax purposes. Before entering into any tax-motivated transaction, a corporate treasurer or private individual should explore in detail how the structure could be unwound in the event of legislative change and how costly this process could be.Business Snapshot 10.1 Tax Planning Using Options
As a simple example of a possible tax planning strategy using options, suppose that Country A has a tax regime where the tax is low on interest and dividends and high on capital gains, while Country B has a tax regime where tax is high on interest and dividends and low on capital gains. It is advantageous for a company to receive the income from a security in Country A and the capital gain, if there is one, in  
Country B. The company would like to keep capital losses in Country A, where they can be used to offset capital gains on other items. All of this can be  
accomplished by arranging for a subsidiary company in Country A to have legal ownership of the security and for a subsidiary company in Country B to buy a call option on the security from the company in Country A, with the strike price of the option equal to the current value of the security. During the life of the option, income from the security is earned in Country A. If the security price rises sharply, the option will be exercised and the capital gain will be realized in Country B. If it falls sharply, the option will not be exercised and the capital loss will be realized in Country A.
Warrants are options issued by a financial institution or nonfinancial corporation. For example, a financial institution might issue 1 million put warrants on gold, each  
warrant giving the holder the right to sell 10 ounces of gold for $1,000 per ounce. It could then proceed to create a market for the warrants. To exercise the warrant, the 10.11   WARRANTS, EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS, AND CONVERTIBLES
M10_HULL0654_11_GE_C10.indd   241 30/04/2021   16:50242 CHAPTER 10
holder would contact the financial institution. A common use of warrants by a non-  
financial corporation is at the time of a bond issue. The corporation issues call warrants 
giving the holder the right to buy its own stock for a certain price at a certain future time and then attaches them to the bonds to make the bonds more attractive to  
investors.
Employee stock options are call options issued to employees by their company to 
motivate them to act in the best interests of the company’s shareholders (see Chap-ter 16). They are usually at the money at the time of issue. Accounting standards now require them to be expensed at fair market value on the income statement of the company.
Convertible bonds, often referred to as convertibles, are bonds issued by a company that 
can be converted into equity at certain times using a predetermined exchange ratio. They are therefore bonds with an embedded call option on the company’s stock.
One feature of warrants, employee stock options, and convertibles is that a pre-
determined number of options are issued. By contrast, the number of options on a particular stock that trade on the CBOE or another exchange is not predetermined. (As people take positions in a particular option series, the number of options outstanding increases; as people close out positions, it declines.) Warrants issued by a company on its own stock, employee stock options, and convertibles are different from exchange-traded options in another important way. When these instruments are exercised, the company issues more shares of its own stock and sells them to the option holder for the strike price. The exercise of the instruments therefore leads to an increase in the number of shares of the company’s stock that are outstanding. By contrast, when an exchange-traded call option is exercised, the party with the short position buys in the market shares that have already been issued and sells them to the party with the long position for the strike price. The company whose stock underlies the option is not involved in any way.
Most of this chapter has focused on exchange-traded options markets. The over-the-
counter market for options has become increasingly important since the early 1980s and is now larger than the exchange-traded market. As explained in Chapter 1, the main participants in over-the-counter markets are financial institutions, corporate  
treasurers, and fund managers. There is a wide range of assets underlying the options. Over-the-counter options on foreign exchange and interest rates are particularly  
popular. The chief potential disadvantage of the over-the-counter market is that the option writer may default. This means that the purchaser is subject to some credit risk. In an attempt to overcome this disadvantage, market participants (and regulators) often require counterparties to post collateral. This was discussed in Section 2.5.
The instruments traded in the over-the-counter market are often structured by 
financial institutions to meet the precise needs of their clients. Sometimes this involves choosing exercise dates, strike prices, and contract sizes that are different from those offered by an exchange. In other cases the structure of the option is different from standard calls and puts. The option is then referred to as an exotic option. Chapter 26 
describes a number of different types of exotic options.
10.12   OVER-THE-COUNTER OPTIONS MARKETS
M10_HULL0654_11_GE_C10.indd   242 30/04/2021   16:50Mechanics of Options Markets 243
SUMMARY
There are two types of options: calls and puts. A call option gives the holder the right to 
buy the underlying asset for a certain price by a certain date. A put option gives the holder the right to sell the underlying asset by a certain date for a certain price. There are four possible positions in options markets: a long position in a call, a short position in a call, a long position in a put, and a short position in a put. Taking a short position in an option is known as writing it. Options are currently traded on stocks, stock  
indices, foreign currencies, futures contracts, and other assets.
An exchange must specify the terms of the option contracts it trades. In particular, it 
must specify the size of the contract, the precise expiration time, and the strike price. In the United States one stock option contract gives the holder the right to buy or sell 100 shares. The standard expiration of a stock option contract is the third Friday of the expiration month. Options with several different expiration months trade at any given time. Strike prices are at 
$21
2, $5, or $10 intervals, depending on the stock price.
The terms of a stock option are not normally adjusted for cash dividends. However, they 
are adjusted for stock dividends, stock splits, and rights issues. The aim of the adjustment is to keep the positions of both the writer and the buyer of a contract unchanged.
Most option exchanges use market makers. A market maker is an individual who is 
prepared to quote both a bid price (at which he or she is prepared to buy) and an ask price (at which he or she is prepared to sell). Market makers improve the liquidity of the market and ensure that there is never any delay in executing market orders. They themselves make a profit from the difference between their bid and ask prices (known as their bid–ask spread). The exchange has rules specifying upper limits for the bid–ask spread.
Writers of options have potential liabilities and are required to maintain a margin 
account with their brokers. If it is not a member of the Options Clearing Corporation, the broker will maintain a margin account with a firm that is a member. This firm will in turn maintain a margin account with the Options Clearing Corporation. The Options Clearing Corporation is responsible for keeping a record of all outstanding contracts, handling exercise orders, and so on.
Not all options are traded on exchanges. Many options are traded in the over-the-
counter (OTC) market. An advantage of over-the-counter options is that they can be tailored by a financial institution to meet the particular needs of a corporate treasurer or fund manager.

Properties of 
Stock Options11 CHAPTER  
In this chapter, we look at the factors affecting stock option prices. We use a number 
of different arbitrage arguments to explore the relationships between European option prices, American option prices, and the underlying stock price. The most important of these relationships is put–call parity, which is a relationship between the price of a European call option, the price of a European put option, and the underlying stock price.
The chapter examines whether American options should be exercised early. It shows 
that it is never optimal to exercise an American call option on a non-dividend-paying stock prior to the option’s expiration, but that under some circumstances the early  
 exercise of an American put option on such a stock is optimal. When there are  
 dividends, it can be optimal to exercise either calls or puts early.
11.1 FACTORS AFFECTING OPTION PRICES
There are six factors affecting the price of a stock option:
1. The current stock price, S0
2. The strike price, K
3. The time to expiration, T
4. The volatility of the stock price, s
5. The risk-free interest rate, r
6. The dividends that are expected to be paid.
In this section, we consider what happens to option prices when there is a change to one 
of these factors, with all the other factors remaining fixed. The results are summarized in Table 11.1.
Figures 11.1 and 11.2 show how European call and put prices depend on the first 
five factors in the situation where 
S0=50, K=50, r=5, per annum, s=30, per 
annum, T=1 year, and there are no dividends. In this case the call price is 7.116  
and the put price is 4.677.

increasing one variable while keeping all others fixed.
Stock Price and Strike Price
If a call option is exercised at some future time, the payoff will be the amount by which 
the stock price exceeds the strike price. Call options therefore become more valuable as the stock price increases and less valuable as the strike price increases. For a put option, the payoff on exercise is the amount by which the strike price exceeds the stock price. Put options therefore behave in the opposite way from call options: they become less valuable as the stock price increases and more valuable as the strike price increases. Figure 11.1a–d illustrate the way in which put and call prices depend on the stock price 
and strike price.
Time to Expiration
Now consider the effect of the expiration date. Both put and call American options become more valuable (or at least do not decrease in value) as the time to expiration increases. Consider two American options that differ only as far as the expiration date is concerned. The owner of the long-life option has all the exercise opportunities open to  
the owner of the short-life option—and more. The long-life option must therefore always be worth at least as much as the short-life option.
Although European put and call options usually become more valuable as the time 
to expiration increases (see Figure 11.1e, f), this is not always the case. Consider two European call options on a stock: one with an expiration date in 1 month, the other with an expiration date in 2 months. Suppose that a very large dividend is expected in 6 weeks. The dividend will cause the stock price to decline, so that the short-life option could be worth more than the long-life option.
1 As we explain later in the chapter, it  
can be optimal to exercise a deep-in-the-money American put option early. This means that there are some situations where a short-maturity European put option is more valuable than a similar long-maturity European put option.
1 We assume that, when the life of the option is changed, the dividends on the stock and their timing remain 
unchanged.

Volatility
The precise way in which volatility is defined is explained in Chapter 15. Roughly 
speaking, the volatility of a stock price is a measure of how uncertain we are about 
future stock price movements. As volatility increases, the chance that the stock will do very well or very poorly increases. For the owner of a stock, these two outcomes tend to offset each other. However, this is not so for the owner of a call or put. The owner of a

call benefits from price increases but has limited downside risk in the event of price 
decreases because the most the owner can lose is the price of the option. Similarly, the owner of a put benefits from price decreases, but has limited downside risk in the event of price increases. The values of both calls and puts therefore increase as volatility increases (see Figure 11.2a, b).
Risk-Free Interest Rate
The risk-free interest rate affects the price of an option in a less clear-cut way. As  interest rates in the economy increase, the expected return required by investors from 
the stock tends to increase. In addition, the present value of any future cash flow received by the holder of the option decreases. The combined impact of these two effects is to increase the value of call options and decrease the value of put options (see Figure 11.2c, d).
It is important to emphasize that we are assuming that interest rates change while all 
other variables stay the same. In particular we are assuming in Table 11.1 that interest rates change while the stock price remains the same. In practice, when interest rates rise  Figure 11.2 Effect of changes in volatility and risk-free interest rate on option prices

(fall), stock prices tend to fall (rise). The combined effect of an interest rate increase and 
the accompanying stock price decrease can be to decrease the value of a call option and increase the value of a put option. Similarly, the combined effect of an interest rate decrease and the accompanying stock price increase can be to increase the value of a call option and decrease the value of a put option.
Amount of Future Dividends
Dividends have the effect of reducing the stock price on the ex-dividend date. This is  
bad news for the value of call options and good news for the value of put options. Consider a dividend whose ex-dividend date is during the life of an option. The value of  
the option is negatively related to the size of the dividend if the option is a call and positively related to the size of the dividend if the option is a put.
11.2 ASSUMPTIONS AND NOTATION
In this chapter, we will make assumptions similar to those made when deriving forward and futures prices in Chapter 5. We assume that there are some market participants, such as large investment banks, for which the following statements are true:
1. There are no transaction costs.
2. All trading profits (net of trading losses) are subject to the same tax rate.
3. Borrowing and lending are possible at the risk-free interest rate.
We assume that these market participants are prepared to take advantage of arbitrage  
opportunities as they arise. As discussed in Chapters 1 and 5, this means that any  available arbitrage opportunities disappear very quickly. For the purposes of our 
 analysis, it is therefore reasonable to assume that there are no arbitrage opportunities.
We will use the following notation:
S0: Current stock price
K: Strike price of option
T : Time to expiration of option
ST : Stock price on the expiration date
r:  Continuously compounded risk-free rate of interest for an investment maturing 
in time T
C: Value of American call option to buy one share
P: Value of American put option to sell one share
c: Value of European call option to buy one share
p: Value of European put option to sell one share
It should be noted that r is the nominal risk-free rate of interest, not the real risk-free 
rate of interest.2 The proxies used by the market for the risk-free rate of interest were 
discussed in Chapter 4. A simple arbitrage argument suggests that r70 and this is the 
2 The real rate of interest is the rate of interest earned after adjustment for the effects of inflation. For 
 example, if the nominal rate of interest is 3% and inflation is 2%, the real rate of interest is approximately 1%.
M11_HULL0654_11_GE_C11.indd   251 12/05/2021   17:28252 CHAPTER 11
assumption we make in deriving results in this chapter.3 However, during some periods 
the monetary policies of governments have led to interest rates being negative in some 
currencies such as the euro, Swiss franc, and Japanese yen. Problem 11.21 considers the impact of negative interest rates on the results in this chapter.
3 If r is not greater than zero, there is no advantage to investing spare funds over keeping the funds as 
 (uninvested) cash. To put this another way, why would anyone buy a bond providing a zero or negative yield?11.3 UPPER AND LOWER BOUNDS FOR OPTION PRICES
In this section, we derive upper and lower bounds for option prices. These bounds do 
not depend on any particular assumptions about the factors mentioned in Section 11.1 (except 
r70). If an option price is above the upper bound or below the lower bound, 
then there are profitable opportunities for arbitrageurs.
Upper Bounds
An American or European call option gives the holder the right to buy one share of a stock for a certain price. No matter what happens, the option can never be worth more than the stock. Hence, the stock price is an upper bound to the option price:
 
c…S0 and C…S0 (11.1)
If these relationships were not true, an arbitrageur could easily make a riskless profit by 
buying the stock and selling the call option.
An American put option gives the holder the right to sell one share of a stock for K .  
No matter how low the stock price becomes, the option can never be worth more than K. Hence,
 
P…K (11.2)
For European options, we know that at maturity the option cannot be worth more than K. It follows that it cannot be worth more than the present value of K today:
 
p…Ke-rT (11.3)
If this were not true, an arbitrageur could make a riskless profit by writing the option and investing the proceeds of the sale at the risk-free interest rate.
Lower Bound for Calls on Non-Dividend-Paying Stocks
A lower bound for the price of a European call option on a non-dividend-paying stock is
S0-Ke-rT
We first look at a numerical example and then consider a more formal argument.
Suppose that S0=+20, K=+18, r=10, per annum, and T=1 year. In this case,
S0-Ke-rT=20-18e-0.1=3.71
or $3.71. Consider the situation where the European call price is $3.00, which is less than the theoretical minimum of $3.71. An arbitrageur can short the stock and buy the 
M11_HULL0654_11_GE_C11.indd   252 12/05/2021   17:28Properties of Stock Options 253
call to provide a cash inflow of +20.00-+3.00=+17.00. If invested for 1 year at 10% 
per annum, the $17.00 grows to 17e0.1*1=+18.79. At the end of the year, the option 
expires. If the stock price is greater than $18.00, the arbitrageur exercises the option 
paying $18.00 for the stock and uses the stock to close out the short position. This leads to a profit of
+18.79-+18.00=+0.79
If the stock price is less than $18.00, the stock is bought in the market and the short position is closed out. The arbitrageur then makes an even greater profit. For example, if the stock price is $17.00, the arbitrageur’s profit is
+18.79-+17.00=+1.79
For a more formal argument, we consider the following two portfolios:
Portfolio A:  one European call option plus a zero-coupon bond that provides a payoff of K at time T
Portfolio B: one share of the stock.
In portfolio A, the zero-coupon bond will be worth K at time T. If 
ST7K, the call 
option is exercised at maturity and portfolio A is worth ST. If ST6K, the call option 
expires worthless and the portfolio is worth K. Hence, at time T, portfolio A is worth
max1ST, K2
Portfolio B is worth ST at time T. Hence, portfolio A is always worth as much as, and 
can be worth more than, portfolio B at the option’s maturity. It follows that in the absence of arbitrage opportunities this must also be true today. The zero-coupon bond is worth 
Ke-rT today. Hence,
c+Ke-rTÚS0
or
cÚS0-Ke-rT
Because the worst that can happen to a call option is that it expires worthless, its value cannot be negative. This means that

Example 11.1
Consider a European call option on a non-dividend-paying stock when the stock price is $51, the strike price is $50, the time to maturity is 6 months, and the risk-free  
interest rate is 12% per annum. In this case, 
S0=51, K=50, T=0.5, and r=0.12.
From equation (11.4), a lower bound for the option price is S0-Ke-rT, or
51-50e-0.12*0.5=+3.91
Lower Bound for European Puts on Non-Dividend-Paying Stocks
For a European put option on a non-dividend-paying stock, a lower bound for the price is
Ke-rT-S0
Again, we first consider a numerical example and then look at a more formal argument.
M11_HULL0654_11_GE_C11.indd   253 12/05/2021   17:28254 CHAPTER 11
Suppose that S0=+37, K=+40, r=5, per annum, and T=0.5 years. In this case,
Ke-rT-S0=40e-0.05*0.5-37=+2.01
Consider the situation where the European put price is $1.00, which is less than the 
 theoretical minimum of $2.01. An arbitrageur can borrow $38.00 for 6 months to buy 
both the put and the stock. At the end of the 6 months, the arbitrageur will be required to repay 
38e0.05*0.5=+38.96. If the stock price is below $40.00, the arbitrageur exercises 
the option to sell the stock for $40.00, repays the loan, and makes a profit of
+40.00-+38.96=+1.04
If the stock price is greater than $40.00, the arbitrageur discards the option, sells the stock, and repays the loan for an even greater profit. For example, if the stock price is $42.00, the arbitrageur’s profit is
+42.00-+38.96=+3.04
For a more formal argument, we consider the following two portfolios:
Portfolio C  : one European put option plus one share
Portfolio D  : a zero-coupon bond paying off K at time T.
If ST6K, then the option in portfolio C is exercised at option maturity and the 
 portfolio becomes worth K. If ST7K, then the put option expires worthless and the 
portfolio is worth ST at this time. Hence, portfolio C is worth
max1ST, K2
at time T. Portfolio D is worth K at time T . Hence, portfolio C is always worth as much 
as, and can sometimes be worth more than, portfolio D at time T . It follows that in the  
absence of arbitrage opportunities portfolio C must be worth at least as much as  portfolio D today. Hence,
p+S0ÚKe-rT
or
pÚKe-rT-S0
Because the worst that can happen to a put option is that it expires worthless, its value 
cannot be negative. This means that
 pÚmax1Ke-rT-S0, 02 (11.5)
Example 11.2
Consider a European put option on a non-dividend-paying stock when the stock  
price is $38, the strike price is $40, the time to maturity is 3 months, and the  
risk-free rate of interest is 10% per annum. In this case S0 = 38, K = 40,  
T = 0.25, and r=0.10. From equation (11.5), a lower bound for the option 
price is Ke-rT-S0, or 40e-0.1*0.25-38=+1.01.
M11_HULL0654_11_GE_C11.indd   254 12/05/2021   17:28Properties of Stock Options 255
We now derive an important relationship between the prices of European put and call 
options that have the same strike price and time to maturity. Consider the following two portfolios that were used in the previous section:
Portfolio A:  one European call option plus a zero-coupon bond that provides a payoff of K at time T
Portfolio C  : one European put option plus one share of the stock.
We continue to assume that the stock pays no dividends. The call and put options have the same strike price K and the same time to maturity T.
As discussed in the previous section, the zero-coupon bond in portfolio A will be  
worth K at time T . If the stock price 
ST at time T proves to be above K, then the call  
option in portfolio A will be exercised. This means that portfolio A is worth 
1ST-K2+K=ST at time T in these circumstances. If ST proves to be less than K,  
then the call option in portfolio A will expire worthless and the portfolio will be  
worth K at time T.
In portfolio C, the share will be worth ST at time T. If ST proves to be below K, then 
the put option in portfolio C will be exercised. This means that portfolio C is worth 
1K-ST2+ST=K at time T  in these circumstances. If ST proves to be greater than K , 
then the put option in portfolio C will expire worthless and the portfolio will be worth 
ST at time T.
The situation is summarized in Table 11.2. If ST7K, both portfolios are worth ST at 
time T; if ST6K, both portfolios are worth K at time T . In other words, both are worth
max1ST, K2
when the options expire at time T . Because they are European, the options cannot be  
exercised prior to time T  . Since the portfolios have identical values at time T  , they must  
have identical values today. If this were not the case, an arbitrageur could buy the less  
expensive portfolio and sell the more expensive one. Because the portfolios are  guaranteed to cancel each other out at time T , this trading strategy would lock in an 
arbitrage profit equal to the difference in the values of the two portfolios.

portfolio C are worth p and S0 today. Hence,
 c+Ke-rT=p+S0 (11.6)
This relationship is known as put–call parity. It shows that the value of a European call  
with a certain exercise price and exercise date can be deduced from the value of a 
 European put with the same exercise price and exercise date, and vice versa.
To illustrate the arbitrage opportunities when equation (11.6) does not hold, suppose 
that the stock price is $31, the exercise price is $30, the risk-free interest rate is 10% per  
annum, the price of a three-month European call option is $3, and the price of a  
3-month European put option is $2.25. In this case,
c+Ke-rT=3+30e-0.1*3>12=+32.26
p+S0=2.25+31=+33.25
Portfolio C is overpriced relative to portfolio A. An arbitrageur can buy the securities 
in portfolio A and short the securities in portfolio C. The strategy involves buying the call and shorting both the put and the stock, generating a positive cash flow of
-3+2.25+31=+30.25
up front. When invested at the risk-free interest rate, this amount grows to
30.25e0.1*0.25=+31.02
in three months. If the stock price at expiration of the option is greater than $30, the call will be exercised. If it is less than $30, the put will be exercised. In either case, the arbitrageur ends up buying one share for $30. This share can be used to close out the short position. The net profit is therefore
+31.02-+30.00=+1.02
For an alternative situation, suppose that the call price is $3 and the put price is $1. 
In this case,
c+Ke-rT=3+30e-0.1*3>12=+32.26
p+S0=1+31=+32.00
Portfolio A is overpriced relative to portfolio C. An arbitrageur can short the securities in portfolio A and buy the securities in portfolio C to lock in a profit. The strategy involves shorting the call and buying both the put and the stock with an initial investment of
+31++1-+3=+29
When the investment is financed at the risk-free interest rate, a repayment of 
29e0.1*0.25=+29.73 is required at the end of the three months. As in the previous case, 
either the call or the put will be exercised. The short call and long put option position therefore leads to the stock being sold for $30.00. The net profit is therefore
+30.00-+29.73=+0.27
These examples are illustrated in Table 11.3. Business Snapshot 11.1 shows how options and put–call parity can help us understand the positions of the debt holders and equity holders in a company.
M11_HULL0654_11_GE_C11.indd   256 12/05/2021   17:28Properties of Stock Options 257
American Options
Put–call parity holds only for European options. However, it is possible to derive some 
results for American option prices. It can be shown (see Problem 11.17) that, when there are no dividends,
 
S0-K…C-P…S0-Ke-rT (11.7)
Example 11.3
An American call option on a non-dividend-paying stock with strike price $20.00 
and maturity in 5 months is worth $1.50. Suppose that the current stock price is $19.00 and the risk-free interest rate is 10% per annum. From equation (11.7), we  
have
19-20…C-P…19-20e-0.1*5>12
or
1ÚP-CÚ0.18
showing that P-C lies between $0.18 and $1.00. With C at $1.50, P must lie 
between $1.68 and $2.50. In other words, upper and lower bounds for the price of an American put with the same strike price and expiration date as the American call are $2.50 and $1.68.Three-month put price = $2.25 Three-month put price = $1

11.5 CALLS ON A NON-DIVIDEND-PAYING STOCK
In this section, we first show that it is never optimal to exercise an American call option on a non-dividend-paying stock before the expiration date.
To illustrate the general nature of the argument, consider an American call option on 
a non-dividend-paying stock with one month to expiration when the stock price is $70  
M11_HULL0654_11_GE_C11.indd   257 12/05/2021   17:28258 CHAPTER 11
and the strike price is $40. The option is deep in the money, and the investor who owns 
the option might well be tempted to exercise it immediately. However, if the investor plans to hold the stock obtained by exercising the option for more than one month, this is not the best strategy. A better course of action is to keep the option and exercise it at  
the end of the month. The $40 strike price is then paid out one month later than it  
would be if the option were exercised immediately, so that interest is earned on the $40  
for one month. Because the stock pays no dividends, no income from the stock is  sacrificed. A further advantage of waiting rather than exercising immediately is that 
there is some chance (however remote) that the stock price will fall below $40 in one month. In this case the investor will not exercise in one month and will be glad that the decision to exercise early was not taken!
This argument shows that there are no advantages to exercising early if the investor 
plans to keep the stock for the remaining life of the option (one month, in this case). What if the investor thinks the stock is currently overpriced and is wondering whether Business Snapshot 11.1 Put–Call Parity and Capital Structure
Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert Merton were the pioneers of option  pricing. In the early 1970s, they also showed that options can be used to characterize 
the capital structure of a company. Today this analysis is widely used by financial institutions to assess a company’s credit risk.
To illustrate the analysis, consider a simple situation where a company has assets 
that are financed with zero-coupon bonds and equity. The bonds mature in five years at which time a principal payment of K is required. The company pays no dividends. If the assets are worth more than K in five years, the equity holders choose to repay the bond holders. If the assets are worth less than K, the equity holders choose to declare bankruptcy and the bond holders end up owning the company.
The value of the equity in five years is therefore 
max1AT-K, 02, where AT is the 
value of the company’s assets at that time. This shows that the equity holders have a five-year European call option on the assets of the company with a strike price of K . 
What about the bond holders? They get 
min1AT, K2 in five years. This is the same as 
K-max1K-AT, 02, so that today the bonds are worth the present value of K  minus 
the value of a five-year European put option on the assets with a strike price of K .
To summarize, if c and p are the values, respectively, of five-year call and put 
options on the company’s assets with strike price K, then
Value of company>s equity=c
Value of company>s debt=PV1K2-p
Denote the value of the assets of the company today by A0. The value of the assets 
must equal the total value of the instruments used to finance the assets. This means that it must equal the sum of the value of the equity and the value of the debt, so that
A0=c+3PV1K2-p4
Rearranging this equation, we have
c+PV1K2=p+A0
This is the put–call parity result in equation (11.6) for call and put options on the assets of the company.
M11_HULL0654_11_GE_C11.indd   258 12/05/2021   17:28Properties of Stock Options 259
to exercise the option and sell the stock? In this case, the investor is better off selling the  
option than exercising it.4 The option will be bought by another investor who does  
want to hold the stock. Such investors must exist. Otherwise the current stock price 
would not be $70. The price obtained for the option will be greater than its intrinsic value of $30, for the reasons mentioned earlier.
For a more formal argument, we can use equation (11.4):
cÚS0-Ke-rT
Because the owner of an American call has all the exercise opportunities open to the owner of the corresponding European call, we must have 
CÚc. Hence,
CÚS0-Ke-rT
Given r 7 0, it follows that C 7 S0 - K when T 7 0. This means that C is always greater  
than the option’s intrinsic value prior to maturity. If it were optimal to exercise at a particular time prior to maturity, C would equal the option’s intrinsic value at that  
time. It follows that it can never be optimal to exercise early.
To summarize, there are two reasons an American call on a non-dividend-paying 
stock should not be exercised early. One relates to the insurance that it provides. A call option, when held instead of the stock itself, in effect insures the holder against the stock price falling below the strike price. Once the option has been exercised and the strike price has been exchanged for the stock price, this insurance vanishes. The other reason concerns the time value of money. From the perspective of the option holder, the later the strike price is paid out the better.
Bounds
Because American call options are never exercised early when there are no dividends, they are equivalent to European call options, so that 
C=c. From equations (11.1)

11.6 PUTS ON A NON-DIVIDEND-PAYING STOCK
It can be optimal to exercise an American put option on a non-dividend-paying stock early. Indeed, at any given time during its life, the put option should always be exercised early if it is sufficiently deep in the money.
To illustrate, consider an extreme situation. Suppose that the strike price is $10 and  
the stock price is virtually zero. By exercising immediately, an investor makes an  immediate gain of $10. If the investor waits, the gain from exercise might be less than 
$10, but it cannot be more than $10, because negative stock prices are impossible. Furthermore, assuming the interest rate is positive, receiving $10 now is preferable to receiving $10 in the future. It follows that the option should be exercised immediately.
Like a call option, a put option can be viewed as providing insurance. A put option, 
when held in conjunction with the stock, insures the holder against the stock price  falling below a certain level. However, a put option is different from a call option in  
that it may be optimal for an investor to forgo this insurance and exercise early in 
order to realize the strike price immediately. In general, the early exercise of a put option becomes more attractive as 
S0 decreases, as r  increases, and as the volatility 
decreases.

Bounds
From equations (11.3) and (11.5), lower and upper bounds for a European put option 
when there are no dividends are given by
max1Ke-rT-S0, 02…p…Ke-rT
For an American put option on a non-dividend-paying stock, the condition
PÚmax1K-S0, 02
must apply because the option can be exercised at any time. This is a stronger  condition than the one for a European put option in equation (11.5). Using the result 
in equation (11.2), bounds for an American put option on a non-dividend-paying stock are
max1K-S0, 02…P…K
Figure 11.5 illustrates the bounds.
Figure 11.6 shows the general way in which the price of an American put option 
 varies with S0. As we argued earlier, provided that r70, it is always optimal to  exercise 
an American put immediately when the stock price is sufficiently low. When early  exercise is optimal, the value of the option is 
K-S0. The curve representing the value 
of the put therefore merges into the put’s intrinsic value, K-S0, for a sufficiently small 
value of S0. In Figure 11.6, this value of S0 is shown as point A. The line relating the put 
price to the stock price moves in the direction indicated by the arrows when r decreases, 
when the volatility increases, and when T increases.
Because there are some circumstances when it is desirable to exercise an American 
put option early, it follows that an American put option is always worth more than the  
corresponding European put option. Furthermore, because an American put is some-times worth its intrinsic value (see Figure 11.6), it follows that a European put option 
must sometimes be worth less than its intrinsic value. This means that the curve  representing the relationship between the put price and the stock price for a European 
option must be below the corresponding curve for an American option.
Figure 11.7 shows the variation of the European put price with the stock price. Note 
that point B in Figure 11.7, at which the price of the option is equal to its intrinsic

11.7 EFFECT OF DIVIDENDS
The results produced so far in this chapter have assumed that we are dealing with options on a non-dividend-paying stock. In this section, we examine the impact of  dividends. We assume that the dividends that will be paid during the life of the option

are known. In many situations, this assumption is often not too unreasonable. We will 
use D to denote the present value of the dividends during the life of the option. In the 
calculation of D, a dividend is assumed to occur at the time of its ex-dividend date.
Lower Bound for Calls and Puts
We can redefine portfolios A and B as follows:
Portfolio A: one European call option plus an amount of cash equal to D+Ke-rT
Portfolio B: one share
A similar argument to the one used to derive equation (11.4) shows that
 cÚmax1S0-D-Ke-rT, 02 (11.8)
We can also redefine portfolios C and D as follows:
Portfolio C  : one European put option plus one share
Portfolio D : an amount of cash equal to D+Ke-rT
A similar argument to the one used to derive equation (11.5) shows that 
pÚmax1D+Ke-rT-S0, 02 (11.9)
Early Exercise
When dividends are expected, we can no longer assert that an American call option will 
not be exercised early. Sometimes it is optimal to exercise an American call immediately prior to an ex-dividend date. It is never optimal to exercise a call at other times. This point is discussed further in Section 15.12.
Put–Call Parity
Comparing the value at option maturity of the redefined portfolios A and C shows that, with dividends, the put–call parity result in equation (11.6) becomes
 
c+D+Ke-rT=p+S0 (11.10)
Dividends cause equation (11.7) to be modified (see Problem 11.18) to 
S0-D-K…C-P…S0-Ke-rT (11.11)
SUMMARY
There are six factors affecting the value of a stock option: the current stock price, the 
strike price, the time to expiration, the stock price volatility, the risk-free interest rate, and the dividends expected during the life of the option. The value of a call usually increases as the current stock price, the time to expiration, the volatility, and the risk-free interest rate increase. The value of a call decreases as the strike price and expected dividends increase. The value of a put usually increases as the strike price, the time to  
expiration, the volatility, and the expected dividends increase. The value of a put decreases as the current stock price and the risk-free interest rate increase.
M11_HULL0654_11_GE_C11.indd   263 12/05/2021   17:28264 CHAPTER 11
It is possible to reach some conclusions about the value of stock options without 
making any assumptions about the volatility of stock prices. For example, the price of a  
call option on a stock must always be worth less than the price of the stock itself. 
 Similarly, the price of a put option on a stock must always be worth less than the 
option’s strike price.
A European call option on a non-dividend-paying stock must be worth more than
max1S0-Ke-rT, 02
where S0 is the stock price, K is the strike price, r is the risk-free interest rate, and T is 
the time to expiration. A European put option on a non-dividend-paying stock must be worth more than
max1Ke-rT-S0, 02
When dividends with present value D  will be paid, the lower bound for a European call 
option becomes
 max1S0-D-Ke-rT, 02
and the lower bound for a European put option becomes
max1Ke-rT+D-S0, 02
Put–call parity is a relationship between the price, c, of a European call option on a stock and the price, p, of a European put option on a stock. For a non-dividend-paying stock, it is
c+Ke-rT=p+S0
For a dividend-paying stock, the put–call parity relationship is
c+D+Ke-rT=p+S0
Put–call parity does not hold for American options. However, it is possible to use  arbitrage arguments to obtain upper and lower bounds for the difference between the 
price of an American call and the price of an American put.
In Chapter 15, we will carry the analyses in this chapter further by making specific 
assumptions about the probabilistic behavior of stock prices. The analysis will enable us to derive exact pricing formulas for European stock options. In Chapters 13 and 21, we will see how numerical procedures can be used to price American options.

Trading Strategies 
Involving Options12CHAPTER  
We discussed the profit pattern from an investment in a single option in Chapter 10. In 
this chapter we look at what can be achieved when an option is traded in conjunction with other assets. In particular, we examine the properties of portfolios consisting of (a) an option and a zero-coupon bond, (b) an option and the asset underlying the option, and (c) two or more options on the same asset.
A natural question is why a trader would want the profit patterns discussed here. The 
answer is that the choices a trader makes depend on the trader’s judgment about how prices will move and the trader’s willingness to take risks. Principal-protected notes, discussed in Section 12.1 appeal to individuals who are risk-averse. They do not want to  
risk losing their principal, but have an opinion about whether a particular asset will increase or decrease in value and are prepared to let the return they earn on this  principal depend on whether they are right. If a trader is willing to take rather more risk 
than this, he or she could choose a bull or bear spread, discussed in Section 12.3. Yet more risk would be taken with a straightforward long position in a call or put option.
Suppose that a trader feels there will be a big move in price of an asset, but does not 
know whether this will be up or down. There are a number of alternative trading  strategies. A risk-averse trader might choose a reverse butterfly spread, discussed in 
Section 12.3, where there will be a small gain if the trader’s hunch is correct and a small  
loss if it is not. A more aggressive investor might choose a straddle or strangle,  
discussed in Section 12.4, where potential gains and losses are larger.
Further trading strategies involving options are considered in later chapters. For 
example, Chapter 17 shows how options on stock indices can be used to manage the risks in a stock portfolio and explains how range forward contracts can be used to hedge a foreign exchange exposure; Chapter 19 covers the way in which Greek letters are used to manage the risks when derivatives are traded; Chapter 26 covers exotic options and what is known as static options replication.
12.1 PRINCIPAL-PROTECTED NOTES
Options are often used to create what are termed principal-protected notes for the retail market. These are products that appeal to conservative investors. The return earned by the investor depends on the performance of a stock, a stock index, or other risky asset, 
M12_HULL0654_11_GE_C12.indd   268 30/04/2021   17:27Trading Strategies Involving Options 269
but the initial principal amount invested is not at risk. An example will illustrate how a 
simple principal-protected note can be created.
Example 12.1
Suppose that the 3-year interest rate is 6% with continuous compounding. This 
means that 1,000e-0.06*3=+835.27 will grow to $1,000 in 3 years. The difference 
between $1,000 and $835.27 is $164.73. Suppose that a stock portfolio is worth $1,000 and provides a dividend yield of 1.5% per annum. Suppose further that a 3-year at-the-money European call option on the stock portfolio can be purchased for less than $164.73. (From DerivaGem, it can be verified that this will be the case if the volatility of the value of the portfolio is less than about 15%.) A bank can offer clients a $1,000 investment opportunity consisting of:
1. A 3-year zero-coupon bond with a principal of $1,000
2. A 3-year at-the-money European call option on the stock portfolio.
If the value of the porfolio increases the investor gets whatever $1,000 invested in the portfolio would have grown to. (This is because the zero-coupon bond pays  
off $1,000 and this equals the strike price of the option.) If the value of the  portfolio goes down, the option has no value, but payoff from the zero-coupon 
bond ensures that the investor receives the original $1,000 principal invested.
The attraction of a principal-protected note is that an investor is able to take a risky position without risking any principal. The worst that can happen is that the investor loses the chance to earn interest, or other income such as dividends, on the initial investment for the life of the note.
There are many variations on the product in Example 12.1. An investor who thinks 
that the price of an asset will decline can buy a principal-protected note consisting of a zero-coupon bond plus a put option. The investor’s payoff in 3 years is then $1,000 plus the payoff (if any) from the put option.
Is a principal-protected note a good deal from the retail investor’s perspective? A 
bank will always build in a profit for itself when it creates a principal-protected note. This means that, in Example 12.1, the zero-coupon bond plus the call option will always cost the bank less than $1,000. In addition, investors are taking the risk that the bank will not be in a position to make the payoff on the principal-protected note at maturity. (Some retail investors lost money on principal-protected notes created by Lehman Brothers when it failed in 2008.) In some situations, therefore, an investor will be better off if he or she buys the underlying option in the usual way and invests the remaining principal in a risk-free investment. However, this is not always the case. The investor is likely to face wider bid–ask spreads on the option than the bank and is likely to earn lower interest rates than the bank. It is therefore possible that the bank can add value for the investor while making a profit itself.
Now let us look at the principal-protected notes from the perspective of the bank. The 
economic viability of the structure in Example 12.1 depends critically on the level of 
interest rates and the volatility of the portfolio. If the interest rate is 3% instead of 6%, the bank has only 
1,000-1,000e-0.03*3=+86.07 with which to buy the call option. If 
interest rates are 6%, but the volatility is 25% instead of 15%, the price of the option would be about $221. In either of these circumstances, the product described in  
Example 12.1 cannot be profitably created by the bank. However, there are a number 
M12_HULL0654_11_GE_C12.indd   269 30/04/2021   17:27270 CHAPTER 12
of ways the bank can still create a viable 3-year product. For example, the strike price of  
the option can be increased so that the value of the portfolio has to rise by, say, 15% 
before the investor makes a gain; the investor’s return could be capped; the return of the investor could depend on the average price of the asset instead of the final price; a knockout barrier could be specified. The derivatives involved in some of these alter-natives will be discussed later in the book. (Capping the option corresponds to the creation of a bull spread for the investor and will be discussed later in this chapter.)
One way in which a bank can sometimes create a profitable principal-protected note 
when interest rates are low or volatilities are high is by increasing its life. Consider the situation in Example 12.1 when (a) the interest rate is 3% rather than 6% and (b) the  
stock portfolio has a volatility of 15% and provides a dividend yield of 1.5%.  
DerivaGem shows that a 3-year at-the-money European option costs about $119. This is more than the funds available to purchase it 
11,000-1,000e-0.03*3=+86.072. A 
10-year at-the-money option costs about $217. This is less than the funds available to purchase it 
11,000-1,000e-0.03*10=+259.182, making the structure profitable. When 
the life is increased to 20 years, the option cost is about $281, which is much less than the funds available to purchase it 
11,000-1,000e-0.03*20=+451.192, so that the struc-
ture is even more profitable.
A critical variable for the bank in our example is the dividend yield. The higher it is, 
the more profitable the product is for the bank. If the dividend yield were zero, the principal-protected note in Example 12.1 cannot be profitable for the bank no matter how long it lasts. (This follows from equation (11.4).)
12.2 TRADING AN OPTION AND THE UNDERLYING ASSET
For convenience, we will assume that the asset underlying the options considered in the rest of the chapter is a stock. (Similar trading strategies can be developed for other underlying assets.) We will also follow the usual practice of calculating the profit from a trading strategy as the final payoff minus the initial cost without any discounting.
There are a number of different trading strategies involving a single option on a stock 
and the stock itself. The profits from these are illustrated in Figure 12.1. In this figure and in other figures throughout this chapter, the dashed line shows the relationship between profit and the stock price for the individual securities constituting the  portfolio, whereas the solid line shows the relationship between profit and the stock 
price for the whole portfolio.
In Figure 12.1a, the portfolio consists of a long position in a stock plus a short 
 position in a European call option. This is known as writing a covered call. The long 
stock position “covers” or protects the investor from the payoff on the short call that becomes necessary if there is a sharp rise in the stock price. In Figure 12.1b, a short position in a stock is combined with a long position in a call option. This is the reverse of writing a covered call. In Figure 12.1c, the investment strategy involves buying a European put option on a stock and the stock itself. This is referred to as a protective put strategy. In Figure 12.1d, a short position in a put option is combined with a short position in the stock. This is the reverse of a protective put.
The profit patterns in Figures 12.1a, b, c, and d have the same general shape as the 
profit patterns discussed in Chapter 10 for short put, long put, long call, and short call, 
M12_HULL0654_11_GE_C12.indd   270 30/04/2021   17:27Trading Strategies Involving Options 271
respectively. Put–call parity provides a way of understanding why this is so. From 
 Chapter 11, the put–call parity relationship is
 p+S0=c+Ke-rT+D (12.1)
where p is the price of a European put, S0 is the stock price, c is the price of a European 
call, K is the strike price of both call and put, r is the risk-free interest rate, T is the time

Equation (12.1) shows that a long position in a European put combined with a long 
position in the stock is equivalent to a long European call position plus a certain 
amount 1= Ke-rT+D2 of cash. This explains why the profit pattern in Figure 12.1c is 
similar to the profit pattern from a long call position. The position in Figure 12.1d is the 
reverse of that in Figure 12.1c and therefore leads to a profit pattern similar to that from a short call position.
Equation (12.1) can be rearranged to become
S0-c=Ke-rT+D-p
This shows that a long position in a stock combined with a short position in a European call is equivalent to a short European put position plus a certain amount 
1= Ke-rT+D2 of cash. This equality explains why the profit pattern in Figure 12.1a is 
similar to the profit pattern from a short put position. The position in Figure 12.1b is the reverse of that in Figure 12.1a and therefore leads to a profit pattern similar to that from a long put position.
12.3 SPREADS
A spread trading strategy involves taking a position in two or more options of the same type (i.e., two or more calls or two or more puts).
Bull Spreads
One of the most popular types of spreads is a bull spread. This can be created by buying a European call option on a stock with a certain strike price and selling a European call option on the same stock with a higher strike price. Both options have the same  expiration date. The strategy is illustrated in Figure 12.2. The profits from the two 
option positions taken separately are shown by the dashed lines. The profit from the whole strategy is the sum of the profits given by the dashed lines and is indicated by the solid line. Because a call price always decreases as the strike price increases, the value of the option sold is always less than the value of the option bought. A bull spread, when created from calls, therefore requires an initial investment.
Suppose that 
K1 is the strike price of the call option bought, K2 is the strike price of 
Figure 12.2 Profit from bull spread created using call options.

the call option sold, and ST is the stock price on the expiration date of the options. 
Table 12.1 shows the total payoff that will be realized from a bull spread in different 
circumstances. If the stock price does well and is greater than the higher strike price, the 
payoff is the difference between the two strike prices, or K2-K1. If the stock price on 
the expiration date lies between the two strike prices, the payoff is ST-K1. If the stock 
price on the expiration date is below the lower strike price, the payoff is zero. The profit in Figure 12.2 is calculated by subtracting the initial investment from the payoff.
A bull spread strategy limits the investor’s upside as well as downside risk. The strategy 
can be described by saying that the investor has a call option with a strike price equal to 
K1 and has chosen to give up some upside potential by selling a call option with strike 
price K2 1K27K12. In return for giving up the upside potential, the investor gets the 
price of the option with strike price K2. Three types of bull spreads can be distinguished:
1. Both calls are initially out of the money.
2. One call is initially in the money; the other call is initially out of the money.
3. Both calls are initially in the money.
The most aggressive bull spreads are those of type 1. They cost very little to set up and have a small probability of giving a relatively high payoff 
1= K2-K12. As we move 
from type 1 to type 2 and from type 2 to type 3, the spreads become more conservative.
Example 12.2
An investor buys for $3 a 3-month European call with a strike price of $30 and 
sells for $1 a 3-month European call with a strike price of $35. The payoff from this bull spread strategy is $5 if the stock price is above $35, and zero if it is below $30. If the stock price is between $30 and $35, the payoff is the amount by which the stock price exceeds $30. The cost of the strategy is 
+3-+1=+2. So the 
profit is:

Bull spreads can also be created by buying a European put with a low strike price and selling a European put with a high strike price, as illustrated in Figure 12.3. Unlike bull 
spreads created from calls, those created from puts involve a positive up-front cash flow to the investor, but have margin requirements and a payoff that is either negative or zero.Stock price

Bear Spreads
An investor who enters into a bull spread is hoping that the stock price will increase. By 
contrast, an investor who enters into a bear spread is hoping that the stock price will decline. Bear spreads can be created by buying a European put with one strike price and selling a European put with another strike price. The strike price of the option  purchased is greater than the strike price of the option sold. (This is in contrast to a 
bull spread, where the strike price of the option purchased is always less than the strike price of the option sold.) In Figure 12.4, the profit from the spread is shown by the solid line. A bear spread created from puts involves an initial cash outflow because the price of the put sold is less than the price of the put purchased. In essence, the investor has bought a put with a certain strike price and chosen to give up some of the profit  potential by selling a put with a lower strike price. In return for the profit given up, the 
investor gets the price of the option sold.
Assume that the strike prices are 
K1 and K2, with K16K2. Table 12.2 shows the 
payoff that will be realized from a bear spread in different circumstances. If the stock Figure 12.3 Profit from bull spread created using put options.

price is greater than K2, the payoff is zero. If the stock price is less than K1, the payoff is 
K2-K1. If the stock price is between K1 and K2, the payoff is K2-ST. The profit is 
calculated by subtracting the initial cost from the payoff.
Example 12.3
An investor buys for $3 a 3-month European put with a strike price of $35 and sells 
for $1 a 3-month European put with a strike price of $30. The payoff from this bear spread strategy is zero if the stock price is above $35, and $5 if it is below $30. If the stock price is between $30 and $35, the payoff is 
35-ST. The options cost

Like bull spreads, bear spreads limit both the upside profit potential and the downside risk. Bear spreads can be created using calls instead of puts. The investor buys a call with a high strike price and sells a call with a low strike price, as illustrated in Figure 12.5.

Box Spreads
A box spread is a combination of a bull call spread with strike prices K1 and K2 and a 
bear put spread with the same two strike prices. As shown in Table 12.3, the payoff  
from a box spread is always K2-K1. The value of a box spread is therefore always the 
present value of this payoff or 1K2-K12e-rT. If it has a different value there is an 
 arbitrage opportunity. If the market price of the box spread is too low, it is profitable to 
buy the box. This involves buying a call with strike price K1, buying a put with strike 
price K2, selling a call with strike price K2, and selling a put with strike price K1. If the 
market price of the box spread is too high, it is profitable to sell the box. This involves buying a call with strike price 
K2, buying a put with strike price K1, selling a call with 
strike price K1, and selling a put with strike price K2.
It is important to realize that a box-spread arbitrage only works with European 
options. Many of the options that trade on exchanges are American. As shown in  Business Snapshot 12.1, inexperienced traders who treat American options as European 
are liable to lose money.
Butterfly Spreads
A butterfly spread involves positions in options with three different strike prices. It can 
be created by buying a European call option with a relatively low strike price K1, Stock price

Business Snapshot 12.1 Losing Money with Box Spreads
Suppose that a stock has a price of $50 and a volatility of 30%. No dividends are 
expected and the risk-free rate is 8%. A trader offers you the chance to sell on the CBOE a 2-month box spread where the strike prices are $55 and $60 for $5.10. Should you do the trade?
The trade certainly sounds attractive. In this case 
K1=55, K2=60, and the payoff 
is certain to be $5 in 2 months. By selling the box spread for $5.10 and investing the funds for 2 months you would have more than enough funds to meet the $5 payoff in 2 months. The theoretical value of the box spread today is 
5*e-0.08*2>12=+4.93.
Unfortunately there is a snag. CBOE stock options are American and the $5 payoff 
from the box spread is calculated on the assumption that the options comprising the box are European. Option prices for this example (calculated using DerivaGem) are shown in the table below. A bull call spread where the strike prices are $55 and $60 costs 
0.96-0.26=+0.70. (This is the same for both European and American options 
because, as we saw in Chapter 11, the price of a European call is the same as the price of an American call when there are no dividends.) A bear put spread with the same strike prices costs 9.46 - 5.23 = $4.23 if the options are European and 10.00 - 5.44 = $4.56 if they are American. The combined value of both spreads if they are created with European options is 
0.70+4.23=+4.93. This is the  theoretical box spread price 
calculated above. The combined value of buying both spreads if they are American is 
0.70+4.56=+5.26. Selling a box spread created with American options for $5.10 
would not be a good trade. You would realize this almost immediately as the trade involves selling a $60 strike put and this would be exercised against you almost as soon as you sold it!

 buying a European call option with a relatively high strike price K3, and selling two 
European call options with a strike price K2 that is halfway between K1 and K3. 
 Generally, K2 is close to the current stock price. The pattern of profits from the strategy 
is shown in Figure 12.6. A butterfly spread leads to a profit if the stock price stays close 
to K2, but gives rise to a small loss if there is a significant stock price move in either 
direction. It is therefore an appropriate strategy for an investor who feels that large stock price moves are unlikely. The strategy requires a small investment initially. The payoff from a butterfly spread is shown in Table 12.4.
Suppose that a certain stock is currently worth $61. Consider an investor who feels 
that a significant price move in the next 6 months is unlikely. Suppose that the market prices of 6-month European calls are as follows:
Strike price ($) Call price ($)
55 10
60 7
65 5
The investor could create a butterfly spread by buying one call with a $55 strike price, buying one call with a $65 strike price, and selling two calls with a $60 strike price. It costs 
+10++5-12*+72=+1 to create the spread. If the stock price in 6 months is 
greater than $65 or less than $55, the total payoff is zero, and the investor incurs a net loss of $1. If the stock price is between $56 and $64, a profit is made. The maximum profit, $4, occurs when the stock price in 6 months is $60.
Butterfly spreads can be created using put options. The investor buys two European 
puts, one with a low strike price and one with a high strike price, and sells two  European puts with an intermediate strike price, as illustrated in Figure 12.7. The 
butterfly spread in the example considered above would be created by buying one put 
with a strike price of $55, another with a strike price of $65, and selling two puts with a strike price of $60. The use of put options results in exactly the same spread as the use of call options. Put–call parity can be used to show that the initial investment is the same in both cases.

A butterfly spread can be sold or shorted by following the reverse strategy. Options 
are sold with strike prices of K1 and K3, and two options with the middle strike price K2 
are purchased. This strategy produces a modest profit if there is a significant movement 
in the stock price.
Calendar Spreads
Up to now we have assumed that the options used to create a spread all expire at the same time. We now move on to consider calendar spreads in which the options have the same strike price and different expiration dates.
A calendar spread can be created by selling a European call option with a certain 
strike price and buying a longer-maturity European call option with the same strike price. The longer the maturity of an option, the more expensive it usually is. A calendar spread therefore usually requires an initial investment. Profit diagrams for calendar spreads are usually produced so that they show the profit when the short-maturity option expires on the assumption that the long-maturity option is closed out at that time. The profit pattern for a calendar spread produced from call options is shown in Figure 12.8. The pattern is similar to the profit from the butterfly spread in Figure 12.6. The investor makes a profit if the stock price at the expiration of the short-maturity option is close to the strike price of the short-maturity option. However, a loss is incurred when the stock price is significantly above or significantly below this strike price.
To understand the profit pattern from a calendar spread, first consider what happens 
if the stock price is very low when the short-maturity option expires. The short-maturity option is worthless and the value of the long-maturity option is close to zero. The  investor therefore incurs a loss that is close to the cost of setting up the spread initially. 
Consider next what happens if the stock price, 
ST, is very high when the short-maturity 
option expires. The short-maturity option costs the investor ST-K, and the long- 
maturity option is worth close to ST-K, where K is the strike price of the options. 
Again, the investor makes a net loss that is close to the cost of setting up the spread

initially. If ST is close to K, the short-maturity option costs the investor either a small 
amount or nothing at all. However, the long-maturity option is still quite valuable. In 
this case a net profit is made.
In a neutral calendar spread, a strike price close to the current stock price is chosen. 
A bullish calendar spread involves a higher strike price, whereas a bearish calendar 
spread involves a lower strike price.
Calendar spreads can be created with put options as well as call options. The investor 
buys a long-maturity put option and sells a short-maturity put option. As shown in Figure 12.9, the profit pattern is similar to that obtained from using calls.
A reverse calendar spread is the opposite to that in Figures 12.8 and 12.9. The investor 
buys a short-maturity option and sells a long-maturity option. A small profit arises if the stock price at the expiration of the short-maturity option is well above or well below the strike price of the short-maturity option. However, a loss results if it is close to the strike price.
Diagonal Spreads
Bull, bear, and calendar spreads can all be created from a long position in one call and a short position in another call. In the case of bull and bear spreads, the calls have  different strike prices and the same expiration date. In the case of calendar spreads, the 
calls have the same strike price and different expiration dates.
In a diagonal spread both the expiration date and the strike price of the calls are 
different. This increases the range of profit patterns that are possible.Figure 12.9 Profit from calendar spread created using two put options, calculated at

12.4 COMBINATIONS
A combination is an option trading strategy that involves taking a position in both 
calls and puts on the same stock. We will consider straddles, strips, straps, and  strangles.
M12_HULL0654_11_GE_C12.indd   280 30/04/2021   17:27Trading Strategies Involving Options 281
Straddle
One popular combination is a straddle, which involves buying a European call and put 
with the same strike price and expiration date. The profit pattern is shown in Figure 12.10. 
The strike price is denoted by K . If the stock price is close to this strike price at expiration 
of the options, the straddle leads to a loss. However, if there is a sufficiently large move in either direction, a significant profit will result. The payoff from a straddle is calculated in Table 12.5.
A straddle is appropriate when an investor is expecting a large move in a stock price 
but does not know in which direction the move will be. Consider an investor who feels that the price of a certain stock, currently valued at $69 by the market, will move  significantly in the next 3 months. The investor could create a straddle by buying both a 
put and a call with a strike price of $70 and an expiration date in 3 months. Suppose that the call costs $4 and the put costs $3. If the stock price stays at $69, it is easy to see that the strategy costs the investor $6. (An up-front investment of $7 is required, the call expires worthless, and the put expires worth $1.) If the stock price moves to $70, a loss of $7 is experienced. (This is the worst that can happen.) However, if the stock price jumps up to $90, a profit of $13 is made; if the stock moves down to $55, a profit of $8 is made; and so on. As discussed in Business Snapshot 12.2 an investor should carefully consider whether the jump that he or she anticipates is already reflected in option prices before putting on a straddle trade.
The straddle in Figure 12.10 is sometimes referred to as a bottom straddle or straddle 
purchase. A top straddle or straddle write is the reverse position. It is created by selling a call and a put with the same exercise price and expiration date. It is a highly risky strategy.

If the stock price on the expiration date is close to the strike price, a profit results. 
However, the loss arising from a large move is unlimited.
Strips and Straps
A strip consists of a long position in one European call and two European puts with the 
same strike price and expiration date. A strap consists of a long position in two  European calls and one European put with the same strike price and expiration date. 
The profit patterns from strips and straps are shown in Figure 12.11. In a strip the  investor is betting that there will be a big stock price move and considers a decrease in 
the stock price to be more likely than an increase. In a strap the investor is also betting that there will be a big stock price move. However, in this case, an increase in the stock price is considered to be more likely than a decrease.Business Snapshot 12.2 How to Make Money from Trading Straddles
Suppose that a big move is expected in a company’s stock price because there is a takeover bid for the company or the outcome of a major lawsuit involving the  company is about to be announced. Should you trade a straddle?
A straddle seems a natural trading strategy in this case. However, if your view of the 
company’s situation is much the same as that of other market participants, this view 
will be reflected in the prices of options. Options on the stock will be significantly more expensive than options on a similar stock for which no jump is expected. The V-shaped profit pattern from the straddle in Figure 12.10 will have moved downward, so that a bigger move in the stock price is necessary for you to make a profit.
For a straddle to be an effective strategy, you must believe that there are likely to be 
big movements in the stock price and these beliefs must be different from those of most other investors. Market prices incorporate the beliefs of market participants. To make money from any investment strategy, you must take a view that is different from most of the rest of the market—and you must be right!

Strangles
In a strangle, sometimes called a bottom vertical combination, an investor buys a 
 European put and a European call with the same expiration date and different strike 
prices. The profit pattern is shown in Figure 12.12. The call strike price, K2, is higher than 
the put strike price, K1. The payoff function for a strangle is calculated in Table 12.6.
A strangle is a similar strategy to a straddle. The investor is betting that there will be a  
large price move, but is uncertain whether it will be an increase or a decrease.  Comparing Figures 12.12 and 12.10, we see that the stock price has to move farther 
in a strangle than in a straddle for the investor to make a profit. However, the downside risk if the stock price ends up at a central value is less with a strangle.
The profit pattern obtained with a strangle depends on how close together the strike 
prices are. The farther they are apart, the less the downside risk and the farther the stock price has to move for a profit to be realized.
The sale of a strangle is sometimes referred to as a top vertical combination. It can be 
appropriate for an investor who feels that large stock price moves are unlikely. However, as with sale of a straddle, it is a risky strategy involving unlimited potential loss to the investor.

expiring at time T were available with every single possible strike price, any payoff  
function at time T could in theory be obtained. The easiest illustration of this involves 
butterfly spreads. Recall that a butterfly spread is created by buying options with strike prices 
K1 and K3 and selling two options with strike price K2, where K16K26K3 and 
K3-K2=K2-K1. Figure 12.13 shows the payoff from a butterfly spread. The pattern 
could be described as a spike. As K1 and K3 move closer together, the spike becomes 
smaller. Through the judicious combination of a large number of very small spikes, any payoff function can in theory be approximated as accurately as desired.
SUMMARY
Principal-protected notes can be created from a zero-coupon bond and a European call  
option. They are attractive to some investors because the issuer of the product  guarantees that the purchaser will receive his or her principal back regardless of the 
performance of the asset underlying the option.
A number of common trading strategies involve a single option and the underlying 
stock. For example, writing a covered call involves buying the stock and selling a call option on the stock; a protective put involves buying a put option and buying the stock. The former is similar to selling a put option; the latter is similar to buying a call option.
Spreads involve either taking a position in two or more calls or taking a position in 
two or more puts. A bull spread can be created by buying a call (put) with a low strike price and selling a call (put) with a high strike price. A bear spread can be created by buying a put (call) with a high strike price and selling a put (call) with a low strike price. A butterfly spread involves buying calls (puts) with a low and high strike price and selling two calls (puts) with some intermediate strike price. A calendar spread involves selling a call (put) with a short time to expiration and buying a call (put) with a longer time to expiration. A diagonal spread involves a long position in one option and a short position in another option such that both the strike price and the expiration date are different.
Combinations involve taking a position in both calls and puts on the same stock. A 
straddle combination involves taking a long position in a call and a long position in a put with the same strike price and expiration date. A strip consists of a long position in one call and two puts with the same strike price and expiration date.

Binomial Trees13CHAPTER  
A useful and very popular technique for pricing an option involves constructing a 
 binomial tree. This is a diagram representing different possible paths that might be 
 followed by the stock price over the life of an option. The underlying assumption is that 
the stock price follows a random walk. In each time step, it has a certain probability of 
moving up by a certain percentage amount and a certain probability of moving down by a certain percentage amount. In the limit, as the time step becomes smaller, this model is the same as the Black–Scholes–Merton model we will be discussing in Chapter 15. Indeed, in the appendix to this chapter, we show that the European option price given by the binomial tree converges to the Black–Scholes–Merton price as the time step becomes smaller.
The material in this chapter is important for a number of reasons. First, it explains 
the nature of the no-arbitrage arguments that are used for valuing options. Second, it explains the binomial tree numerical procedure that is widely used for valuing American options and other derivatives. Third, it introduces a very important principle known as risk-neutral valuation.
The general approach to constructing trees in this chapter is the one used in an 
important paper published by Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein in 1979. More details on numerical procedures using binomial trees are given in Chapter 21.
13.1 A ONE-STEP BINOMIAL MODEL AND A NO-ARBITRAGE 
ARGUMENT
We start by considering a very simple situation. A stock price is currently $20, and it is 
known that at the end of 3 months it will be either $22 or $18. We are interested in valuing a European call option to buy the stock for $21 in 3 months. This option will have one of two values at the end of the 3 months. If the stock price turns out to be $22, the value of the option will be $1; if the stock price turns out to be $18, the value of the option will be zero. The situation is illustrated in Figure 13.1.
It turns out that a relatively simple argument can be used to price the option in this 
example. The only assumption needed is that arbitrage opportunities do not exist. We set up a portfolio of the stock and the option in such a way that there is no uncertainty 
M13_HULL0654_11_GE_C13.indd   288 12/05/2021   17:33Binomial Trees 289
about the value of the portfolio at the end of the 3 months. We then argue that, because 
the portfolio has no risk, the return it earns must equal the risk-free interest rate. This enables us to work out the cost of setting up the portfolio and therefore the option’s price. Because there are two securities (the stock and the stock option) and only two possible outcomes, it is always possible to set up the riskless portfolio.
Consider a portfolio consisting of a long position in 
∆ shares of the stock and a short 
position in one call option ( ∆ is the Greek capital letter “delta”). We calculate the value 
of ∆ that makes the portfolio riskless. If the stock price moves up from $20 to $22, the 
value of the shares is 22∆ and the value of the option is 1, so that the total value of the 
portfolio is 22∆-1. If the stock price moves down from $20 to $18, the value of the 
shares is 18 ∆ and the value of the option is zero, so that the total value of the portfolio 
is 18∆. The portfolio is riskless if the value of ∆ is chosen so that the final value of the 
portfolio is the same for both alternatives. This means that
22∆-1=18∆
or
∆=0.25
A riskless portfolio is therefore
Long:  0.25 shares
Short:  1 option.
If the stock price moves up to $22, the value of the portfolio is
22*0.25-1=4.5
If the stock price moves down to $18, the value of the portfolio is
18*0.25=4.5
Regardless of whether the stock price moves up or down, the value of the portfolio is always 4.5 at the end of the life of the option.
Riskless portfolios must, in the absence of arbitrage opportunities, earn the risk-free 
rate of interest. Suppose that, in this case, the risk-free rate is 4% per annum (con-tinuously compounded). It follows that the value of the portfolio today must be the present value of 4.5, or
4.5e-0.04*3>12=4.455Figure 13.1 Stock price movements for numerical example in Section 13.1.

M13_HULL0654_11_GE_C13.indd   289 12/05/2021   17:33290 CHAPTER 13
The value of the stock price today is known to be $20. Suppose the option price is 
denoted by f. The value of the portfolio today is
20*0.25-f=5-f
It follows that
5-f=4.455
or
f=0.545
This shows that, in the absence of arbitrage opportunities, the current value of the option must be 0.545. If the value of the option were more than 0.545, the portfolio would cost less than 4.455 to set up and would earn more than the risk-free rate. If the value of the option were less than 0.545, shorting the portfolio would provide a way of borrowing money at less than the risk-free rate.
Trading 0.25 shares is, of course, not possible. However, the argument is the same if 
we imagine selling 400 options and buying 100 shares. In general, it is necessary to buy 
∆ shares for each option sold to form a riskless portfolio. The parameter ∆ (delta) is 
important in the hedging of options. It is discussed further later in this chapter and in Chapter 19.
A Generalization
We can generalize the no-arbitrage argument just presented by considering a stock whose price is 
S0 and an option on the stock (or any derivative dependent on the stock) 
whose current price is f . We suppose that the option lasts for time T  and that during  
the life of the option the stock price can either move up from S0 to a new level, S0u, 
where u71, or down from S0 to a new level, S0d, where d61. The percentage increase 
in the stock price when there is an up movement is u-1; the percentage decrease when 
there is a down movement is 1-d. If the stock price moves up to S0u, we suppose that 
the payoff from the option is fu; if the stock price moves down to S0d, we suppose the 
payoff from the option is fd. The situation is illustrated in Figure 13.2.
As before, we imagine a portfolio consisting of a long position in ∆ shares and a  
short position in one option. We calculate the value of ∆ that makes the portfolio 
 riskless. If there is an up movement in the stock price, the value of the portfolio at the 
end of the life of the option is
S0u∆-fu

M13_HULL0654_11_GE_C13.indd   290 12/05/2021   17:33Binomial Trees 291
If there is a down movement in the stock price, the value becomes
S0d∆-fd
The two are equal when
S0u∆-fu=S0d∆-fd
or
 ∆=fu-fd
S0u-S0d (13.1)
In this case, the portfolio is riskless and, for there to be no arbitrage opportunities, it 
must earn the risk-free interest rate. Equation (13.1) shows that ∆ is the ratio of the 
change in the option price to the change in the stock price as we move between the nodes at time T.
If we denote the risk-free interest rate by r, the present value of the portfolio is
1S0u∆-fu2e-rT
The cost of setting up the portfolio is
S0∆-f
It follows that
S0∆-f=1S0u∆-fu2e-rT
or
f=S0∆11-ue-rT2+fue-rT
Substituting from equation (13.1) for ∆, we obtain
f=S0afu-fd
S0u-S0db11-ue-rT2+fue-rT
or
f=fu11-de-rT2+fd1ue-rT-12
u-d
or
 f=e-rT3pfu+11-p2fd4 (13.2)
where
 p=erT-d
u-d (13.3)
Equations (13.2) and (13.3) enable an option to be priced when stock price movements 
are given by a one-step binomial tree. The only assumption needed for the equation is that there are no arbitrage opportunities in the market.
In the numerical example considered previously (see Figure 13.1), u = 1.1, d = 0.9,  
r = 0.04, T = 0.25, f
u = 1, and fd=0. From equation (13.3), we have
p=e0.04*3>12-0.9
1.1-0.9=0.5503
and, from equation (13.2), we have
f=e-0.04*0.2510.5503*1+0.4497*02=0.545
The result agrees with the answer obtained earlier in this section.
M13_HULL0654_11_GE_C13.indd   291 12/05/2021   17:33292 CHAPTER 13
Irrelevance of the Stock’s Expected Return
The option pricing formula in equation (13.2) does not involve the probabilities of the 
stock price moving up or down. For example, we get the same option price when the probability of an upward movement is 0.5 as we do when it is 0.9. This is surprising and seems counterintuitive. It is natural to assume that, as the probability of an upward movement in the stock price increases, the value of a call option on the stock increases and the value of a put option on the stock decreases. This is not the case.
The key reason is that we are not valuing the option in absolute terms. We are 
 calculating its value in terms of the price of the underlying stock. The probabilities of 
future up or down movements are already incorporated into the stock price: we do not need to take them into account again when valuing the option in terms of the stock price.
13.2 RISK-NEUTRAL VALUATION
We are now in a position to introduce a very important principle in the pricing of derivatives known as risk-neutral valuation. This states that, when valuing a derivative, we can make the assumption that investors are risk-neutral. This assumption means investors do not increase the expected return they require from an investment to  compensate for increased risk. A world where investors are risk-neutral is referred to 
as a risk-neutral world. The world we live in is, of course, not a risk-neutral world. The 
higher the risks investors take, the higher the expected returns they require. However, it  
turns out that assuming a risk-neutral world gives us the right option price for the world we live in, as well as for a risk-neutral world. Almost miraculously, it finesses the problem that we know hardly anything about the risk aversion of the buyers and sellers of options.
Risk-neutral valuation seems a surprising result when it is first encountered. Options 
are risky investments. Should not a person’s risk preferences affect how they are priced?  
The answer is that, when we are pricing an option in terms of the price of the  underlying stock, risk preferences are unimportant. As investors become more risk-
averse, stock prices decline, but the formulas relating option prices to stock prices remain the same.
A risk-neutral world has two features that simplify the pricing of derivatives:
1. The expected return on a stock (or any other investment) is the risk-free rate.
2. The discount rate used for the expected payoff on an option (or any other  instrument) is the risk-free rate.
Returning to equation (13.2), the parameter p should be interpreted as the probability 
of an up movement in a risk-neutral world, so that 
1-p is the probability of a down 
movement in this world. (We assume u7erT, so that 06p61.) The expression
pfu+11-p2fd
is the expected future payoff from the option in a risk-neutral world and equation (13.2) states that the value of the option today is its expected future payoff in a risk-neutral world discounted at the risk-free rate. This is an application of risk-neutral valuation.
M13_HULL0654_11_GE_C13.indd   292 12/05/2021   17:33Binomial Trees 293
To prove the validity of our interpretation of p , we note that, when p  is the 
 probability of an up movement, the expected stock price E1ST2 at time T  is given by
E1ST2=pS0u+11-p2S0d
or
E1ST2=pS01u-d2+S0d
Substituting from equation (13.3) for p gives
 E1ST2=S0erT (13.4)
This shows that the stock price grows, on average, at the risk-free rate when p is the 
probability of an up movement. In other words, the stock price behaves exactly as we would expect it to behave in a risk-neutral world when p is the probability of an up movement.
Risk-neutral valuation is a very important general result in the pricing of derivatives. 
It states that, when we assume the world is risk-neutral, we get the right price for a derivative in all worlds, not just in a risk-neutral one. We have shown that risk-neutral valuation is correct when a simple binomial model is assumed for how the price of the the stock evolves. We will prove it when the stock price follows a continuous-time stochastic process in Chapter 15. It is a result that is true regardless of the assumptions made about the evolution of the stock price.
To apply risk-neutral valuation to the pricing of a derivative, we first calculate what 
the probabilities of different outcomes would be if the world were risk-neutral. We then calculate the expected payoff from the derivative and discount that expected payoff at the risk-free rate of interest.
The One-Step Binomial Example Revisited
We now return to the example in Figure 13.1 and illustrate that risk-neutral valuation gives the same answer as no-arbitrage arguments. In Figure 13.1, the stock price is  currently $20 and will move either up to $22 or down to $18 at the end of 3 months. 
The option considered is a European call option with a strike price of $21 and an  expiration date in 3 months. The risk-free interest rate is 4% per annum.
We define p as the probability of an upward movement in the stock price in a risk- 
neutral world. We can calculate p  from equation (13.3). Alternatively, we can argue that 
the expected return on the stock in a risk-neutral world must be the risk-free rate of 4%. 
This means that p must satisfy
22p+1811-p2=20e0.04*3>12
or
4p=20e0.04*3>12-18
That is, p must be 0.5503.
At the end of the 3 months, the call option has a 0.5503 probability of being worth 1 
and a 0.4497 probability of being worth zero. Its expected value is therefore
0.5503*1+0.4497*0=0.5503
In a risk-neutral world this should be discounted at the risk-free rate. The value of the option today is therefore
0.5503e-0.04*3>12
M13_HULL0654_11_GE_C13.indd   293 12/05/2021   17:33294 CHAPTER 13
or $0.545. This is the same as the value obtained earlier, demonstrating that no-  
arbitrage arguments and risk-neutral valuation give the same answer.
Real World vs. Risk-Neutral World
It should be emphasized that p is the probability of an up movement in a risk-neutral 
world. In general, this is not the same as the probability of an up movement in the real world. In our example 
p=0.5503. When the probability of an up movement is 0.5503,  
the expected return on both the stock and the option is the risk-free rate of 4%.  Suppose that, in the real world, the expected return on the stock is 10% and 
p* is the 
probability of an up movement in this world. It follows that
22p*+1811-p*2=20e0.10*3>12
so that p*=0.6266.
The expected payoff from the option in the real world is then given by
p**1+11-p*2*0
or 0.6266. Unfortunately, it is not easy to know the correct discount rate to apply to the 
expected payoff in the real world. The return the market requires on the stock is 10% and this is the discount rate that would be used for the expected cash flows from an  
investment in the stock. A position in a call option is riskier than a position in the stock. As a result the discount rate to be applied to the payoff from a call option is greater than 10%, but we do not have a direct measure of how much greater than 10% it should be.
1 Using risk-neutral valuation solves this problem because we know that in 
a risk-neutral world the expected return on all assets (and therefore the discount rate to use for all expected payoffs) is the risk-free rate.
1 Since we know the correct value of the option is 0.545, we can deduce that the correct real-world discount 
rate is 55.96%. This is because 0.545=0.6266e-0.5596*3>12.13.3 TWO-STEP BINOMIAL TREES
We can extend the analysis to a two-step binomial tree such as that shown in Figure 13.3. 
Here the stock price starts at $20 and in each of two time steps may go up by 10% or down by 10%. Each time step is 3 months long and the risk-free interest rate is 4% per annum. We consider a 6-month option with a strike price of $21.
The objective of the analysis is to calculate the option price at the initial node of the 
tree. This can be done by repeatedly applying the principles established earlier in the chapter. Figure 13.4 shows the same tree as Figure 13.3, but with both the stock price and the option price at each node. (The stock price is the upper number and the option price is the lower number.) The option prices at the final nodes of the tree are easily calculated. They are the payoffs from the option. At node D the stock price is 24.2 and the option price is 
24.2-21=3.2; at nodes E and F the option is out of the money and 
its value is zero.
At node C the option price is zero, because node C leads to either node E or node F 
and at both of those nodes the option price is zero. We calculate the option price at node B by focusing our attention on the part of the tree shown in Figure 13.5. Using the 
M13_HULL0654_11_GE_C13.indd   294 12/05/2021   17:33Binomial Trees 295
notation introduced earlier in the chapter, u=1.1, d=0.9, r=0.04, and T=0.25, so 
that p=0.5503, and equation (13.2) gives the value of the option at node B as
e-0.04*3>1210.5503*3.2+0.4497*02=1.7433
It remains for us to calculate the option price at the initial node A. We do so by focusing 
on the first step of the tree. We know that the value of the option at node B is 1.7433 and Figure 13.3 Stock prices in a two-step tree.

that at node C it is zero. Equation (13.2) therefore gives the value at node A as
e-0.04*3>1210.5503*1.7433+0.4497*02=0.9497
The value of the option is $0.9497.
Note that this example was constructed so that u  and d  (the proportional up and down 
movements) were the same at each node of the tree and so that the time steps were of the 
same length. As a result, the risk-neutral probability, p , as calculated by equation (13.3) 
is the same at each node.
A Generalization
We can generalize the case of two time steps by considering the situation in Figure 13.6. The stock price is initially 
S0. During each time step, it either moves up to u times its  
value at the beginning of the time step or moves down to d  times this value. The 
 notation for the value of the option is shown on the tree. (For example, after two up 
movements the value of the option is fuu.) We suppose that the risk-free interest rate is r 
and the length of the time step is ∆t years.
Because the length of a time step is now ∆t rather than T, equations (13.2) and (13.3) 
become

variables p2, 2p11-p2, and 11-p22 are the probabilities that the upper, middle, and 
lower final nodes will be reached. The option price is equal to its expected payoff in a 
risk-neutral world discounted at the risk-free interest rate.
As we add more steps to the binomial tree, the risk-neutral valuation principle 
 continues to hold. The option price is always equal to its expected payoff in a risk- 
neutral world discounted at the risk-free interest rate.Figure 13.6 Stock and option prices in general two-step tree.

13.4 A PUT EXAMPLE
The procedures described in this chapter can be used to price puts as well as calls.  Consider a 2-year European put with a strike price of $52 on a stock whose current 
price is $50. We suppose that there are two time steps of 1 year, and in each time step the stock price either moves up by 20% or moves down by 20%. We also suppose that the risk-free interest rate is 5%.
The tree is shown in Figure 13.7. In this case 
u=1.2, d=0.8, ∆t=1, and r=0.05. 
From equation (13.6) the value of the risk-neutral probability, p, is given by
p=e0.05*1-0.8
1.2-0.8=0.6282
The possible final stock prices are: $72, $48, and $32. In this case, fuu=0, fud=4, 
and fdd=20. From equation (13.10),
f=e-2*0.05*110.62822*0+2*0.6282*0.3718*4+0.37182*202=4.1923
The value of the put is $4.1923. This result can also be obtained using equation (13.5)

and working back through the tree one step at a time. Figure 13.7 shows the inter-
mediate option prices that are calculated.Figure 13.7 Using a two-step tree to value a European put option. At each node, the

13.5 AMERICAN OPTIONS
Up to now all the options we have considered have been European. We now move on to consider how American options can be valued using a binomial tree such as that in Figure 13.4 or 13.7. The procedure is to work back through the tree from the end to the  
beginning, testing at each node to see whether early exercise is optimal. The value of the option at the final nodes is the same as for the European option. At earlier nodes the value of the option is the greater of
1. The value given by equation (13.5)
2. The payoff from early exercise.
Figure 13.8 shows how Figure 13.7 is affected if the option under consideration is  
 American rather than European. The stock prices and their probabilities are 
unchanged. The values for the option at the final nodes are also unchanged. At node B, equation (13.5) gives the value of the option as 1.4147, whereas the payoff  from early exercise is negative 
1= -82. Clearly early exercise is not optimal at node B,  
and the value of the option at this node is 1.4147. At node C, equation (13.5) gives the value of the option as 9.4636, whereas the payoff from early exercise is 12. In this case, early exercise is optimal and the value of the option at the node is 12. At the initial node A, the value given by equation (13.5) is
e-0.05*110.6282*1.4147+0.3718*12.02=5.0894
M13_HULL0654_11_GE_C13.indd   298 12/05/2021   17:33Binomial Trees 299
and the payoff from early exercise is 2. In this case early exercise is not optimal. The 
value of the option is therefore $5.0894.Figure 13.8 Using a two-step tree to value an American put option. At each node, the

13.6 DELTA
At this stage, it is appropriate to introduce delta, an important parameter (sometimes 
referred to as a “Greek letter” or simply a “Greek”) in the pricing and hedging of options.
The delta 
1∆2 of a stock option is the ratio of the change in the price of the stock 
option to the change in the price of the underlying stock. It is the number of units of the stock we should hold for each option shorted in order to create a riskless portfolio. It is  
the same as the 
∆ introduced earlier in this chapter. The construction of a riskless 
portfolio is sometimes referred to as delta hedging. The delta of a call option is positive, 
whereas the delta of a put option is negative.
From Figure 13.1, we can calculate the value of the delta of the call option being 
considered as
1-0
22-18=0.25
This is because when the stock price changes from $18 to $22, the option price changes from $0 to $1. (This is also the value of 
∆ calculated in Section 13.1.)
In Figure 13.4 the delta corresponding to stock price movements over the first time 
step is
1.7433-0
22-18=0.4358
M13_HULL0654_11_GE_C13.indd   299 12/05/2021   17:33300 CHAPTER 13
The delta for stock price movements over the second time step is
3.2-0
24.2-19.8=0.7273
if there is an upward movement over the first time step, and
0-0
19.8-16.2=0
if there is a downward movement over the first time step.
From Figure 13.7, delta is
1.4147-9.4636
60-40=-0.4024
at the end of the first time step, and either
0-4
72-48=-0.1667 or 4-20
48-32=-1.0000
at the end of the second time step.
The two-step examples show that delta changes over time. (In Figure 13.4, delta 
changes from 0.4358 to either 0.7273 or 0; and, in Figure 13.7, it changes from -0.4024 to 
either -0.1667 or -1.0000.) Thus, in order to maintain a riskless hedge using an option 
and the underlying stock, we need to adjust our holdings in the stock periodically. We 
will return to this feature of options in Chapter 19.
13.7 MATCHING VOLATILITY WITH u AND d
The three parameters necessary to construct a binomial tree with time step ∆t are u, d, 
and p. Once u  and d  have been specified, p  must be chosen so that the expected return is 
the risk-free rate r. We have already shown that
 p=er∆t-d
u-d (13.11)
The parameters u and d should be chosen to match volatility. The volatility of a stock 
(or any other asset), s, is defined so that the standard deviation of its return in a short 
period of time ∆t is s2∆t (see Chapter 15 for a further discussion of this). Equivalently 
the variance of the return in time ∆t is s2∆t. The variance of a variable X is defined as 
E1X22-3E1X242, where E denotes expected value. During a time step of length ∆t, 
there is a probability p that the stock will provide a return of u-1 and a probability 
1-p that it will provide a return of d-1. It follows that volatility is matched if
 p1u-122+11-p21d-122-3p1u-12+11-p21d-1242=s2∆t (13.12)
Substituting for p from equation (13.11), this simplifies to
 er∆t1u+d2-ud-e2r∆t=s2∆t (13.13)
M13_HULL0654_11_GE_C13.indd   300 12/05/2021   17:33Binomial Trees 301
When terms in ∆t2 and higher powers of ∆t are ignored, a solution to equation (13.13) is2
u=es2∆t and d=e-s2∆t
These are the values of u and d used by Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein (1979).
In the analysis just given we chose u and d to match volatility in the risk-neutral 
world. What happens if instead we match volatility in the real world? As we will now 
show, the formulas for u and d are the same.
Suppose that p* is the probability of an up-movement in the real world while p  is 
as before the probability of an up-movement in a risk-neutral world. This is illustrated in Figure 13.9. Define 
m as the expected return in the real world. We must have
p*u+11-p*2d=em∆t
or
 p*=em∆t-d
u-d (13.14)
Suppose that s is the volatility in the real world. The equation matching the variance is  
the same as equation (13.12) except that p is replaced by p*. When this equation is 
combined with equation (13.14), we obtain
em∆t1u+d2-ud-e2m∆t=s2∆t
This is the same as equation (13.13) except the r is replaced by m. When terms in ∆t2 
and higher powers of ∆t are ignored, it has the same solution as equation (13.13):
u=es2∆t and d=e-s2∆t
Girsanov’s Theorem
The results we have just produced are closely related to an important result known as 
Girsanov’s theorem. When we move from the risk-neutral world to the real world, the expected return from the stock price changes, but its volatility remains the same. More  Figure 13.9 Change in stock price in time ∆t in (a) the real world and (b) the risk-
neutral world.

generally, when we move from a world with one set of risk preferences to a world with  
another set of risk preferences, the expected growth rates in variables change, but their 
volatilities remain the same. We will examine the impact of risk preferences on the behavior of market variables in more detail in Chapter 28. Moving from one set of risk preferences to another is sometimes referred to as changing the measure. The real-world measure is sometimes referred to as the P-measure, while the risk-neutral world measure is referred to as the Q-measure.

3 With the notation we have been using, p is the probability under the Q-measure, while p* is the probability 
under the P-measure.13.8 THE BINOMIAL TREE FORMULAS
The analysis in the previous section shows that, when the length of the time step on a binomial tree is 
∆t, we should match volatility by setting
 u=es2∆t (13.15)
and
 d=e-s2∆t (13.16)
Also, from equation (13.6),
 p=a-d
u-d (13.17)
where
 a=er∆t (13.18)
Equations (13.15) to (13.18) define the tree.
Consider again the American put option in Figure 13.8, where the stock price is $50, 
the strike price is $52, the risk-free rate is 5%, the life of the option is 2 years, and there 
are two time steps. In this case, ∆t=1. Suppose that the volatility s is 30%. Then, 
from equations (13.15) to (13.18), we have
u=e0.3*1=1.3499,  d=1
1.3499=0.7408,  a=e0.05*1=1.0513
and
p=1.0513-0.7408
1.3499-0.7408=0.5097
The tree is shown in Figure 13.10. The value of the put option is 7.43. (This is  different from the value obtained in Figure 13.8 by assuming 
u=1.2 and d=0.8.)  
Note that the option is exercised at the end of the first time step if the lower node is 
reached.
13.9 INCREASING THE NUMBER OF STEPS
The binomial model presented above is unrealistically simple. Clearly, an analyst can expect to obtain only a very rough approximation to an option price by assuming that 
M13_HULL0654_11_GE_C13.indd   302 12/05/2021   17:33Binomial Trees 303
stock price movements during the life of the option consist of one or two binomial 
steps.
When binomial trees are used in practice, the life of the option is typically divided 
into 30 or more time steps. In each time step there is a binomial stock price movement. With 30 time steps there are 31 terminal stock prices and 
230, or about 1 billion, possible 
stock price paths are implicitly considered.
The equations defining the tree are equations (13.15) to (13.18), regardless of the  
number of time steps. Suppose, for example, that there are five steps instead of two in  
the example we considered in Figure 13.10. The parameters would be ∆t=2>5=0.4, 
r=0.05, and s=0.3. These values give u=e0.3*20.4=1.2089, d=1>1.2089=0.8272, 
a=e0.05*0.4=1.0202, and p=11.0202-0.82722>11.2089-0.82722=0.5056.
As the number of time steps is increased (so that ∆t becomes smaller), the  binomial 
tree model makes the same assumptions about stock price behavior as the Black– Scholes–Merton model, which will be presented in Chapter 15. When the binomial tree is used to price a European option, the price converges to the Black–Scholes– Merton 
price, as expected, as the number of time steps is increased. This is proved in the  appendix to this chapter.Figure 13.10 Two-step tree to value a 2-year American put option when the stock 
price is 50, strike price is 52, risk-free rate is 5%, and volatility is 30%.

13.10   USING DerivaG em
The software accompanying this book, DerivaGem, is a useful tool for becoming 
 comfortable with binomial trees. After loading the software in the way described at 
the end of this book, go to the Equity_FX_Indx_Fut_Opts_Calc worksheet. Choose Equity as the Underlying Type and select Binomial American as the Option Type.
M13_HULL0654_11_GE_C13.indd   303 12/05/2021   17:33304 CHAPTER 13
Enter the stock price, volatility, risk-free rate, time to expiration, exercise price, and tree 
steps, as 50, 30%, 5%, 2, 52, and 2, respectively. Click on the Put button and then on Calculate. The price of the option is shown as 7.428 in the box labeled Price. Now click on Display Tree and you will see the equivalent of Figure 13.10. (The red numbers in 
the software indicate the nodes where the option is exercised.)
Return to the Equity_FX_Indx_Fut_Opts_Calc worksheet and change the number 
of time steps to 5. Hit Enter and click on Calculate. You will find that the value of the option changes to 7.671. By clicking on Display Tree the five-step tree is displayed, together with the values of u, d, a, and p calculated above.
DerivaGem can display trees that have up to 10 steps, but the calculations can be 
done for up to 500 steps. In our example, 500 steps gives the option price (to two decimal places) as 7.47. This is an accurate answer. By changing the Option Type to Binomial European, we can use the tree to value a European option. Using 500 time steps, the value of a European option with the same parameters as the American option is 6.76. (By changing the Option Type to Black–Scholes European, we can display the value of the option using the Black–Scholes–Merton formula that will be presented in Chapter 15. This is also 6.76.)
By changing the Underlying Type, we can consider options on assets other than 
stocks. These will now be discussed.
13.11  OPTIONS ON OTHER ASSETS
We introduced options on indices, currencies, and futures contracts in Chapter 10 and will cover them in more detail in Chapters 17 and 18. It turns out that we can  construct 
and use binomial trees for these options in exactly the same way as for options on 
stocks except that the equation for p changes. As in the case of options on stocks, equation (13.2) applies so that the value at a node (before the possibility of early  exercise is considered) is p times the value if there is an up movement plus 
1-p times 
the value if there is a down movement, discounted at the risk-free rate.
Options on Stocks Paying a Continuous Dividend Yield
Consider a stock paying a known dividend yield at rate q. The total return from 
 dividends and capital gains in a risk-neutral world is r. The dividends provide a return 
of q. Capital gains must therefore provide a return of r-q. If the stock starts at S0, its 
expected value after one time step of length ∆t must be S0e1r-q2∆t. This means that
pS0u+11-p2S0d=S0e1r-q2∆t
so that
p=e1r-q2∆t-d
u-d
As in the case of options on non-dividend-paying stocks, we match volatility by setting 
u=es2∆t and d=1>u. This means that we can use equations (13.15) to (13.18), except 
that we set a=e1r-q2∆t instead of a=er∆t.
M13_HULL0654_11_GE_C13.indd   304 12/05/2021   17:33Binomial Trees 305
Options on Stock Indices
When calculating a futures price for a stock index in Chapter 5 we assumed that the 
stocks underlying the index provided a dividend yield at rate q. We make a similar assumption here. The valuation of an option on a stock index is therefore very similar to the valuation of an option on a stock paying a known dividend yield.
Example 13.1
A stock index is currently 810 and has a volatility of 20% and a dividend yield of 
2%. The risk-free rate is 5%. Figure 13.11 shows the output from DerivaGem for valuing a European 6-month call option with a strike price of 800 using a two-step tree. In this case,
∆t=0.25,  u=e0.20*20.25=1.1052,
d=1>u=0.9048,  a=e10.05-0.022*0.25=1.0075
p=11.0075-0.90482>11.1052-0.90482=0.5126
The value of the option is 53.39.

Options on Currencies
As pointed out in Section 5.10, a foreign currency can be regarded as an asset providing 
a yield at the foreign risk-free rate of interest, rf. By analogy with the stock index case 
we can construct a tree for options on a currency by using equations (13.15) to (13.18) and setting 
a=e1r-rf2∆t.
Example 13.2
A foreign currency is currently worth 0.6100 U.S. dollars and this exchange rate has  
a volatility of 12%. The foreign risk-free rate is 7% and the U.S. risk-free rate  
is 5%. Figure 13.12 shows the output from DerivaGem for valuing a 3-month 
 American call option with a strike price of 0.6000 using a three-step tree. In this 
case,
∆t=0.08333, u=e0.12*20.08333=1.0352

The value of the option is 0.019.

Options on Futures
It costs nothing to take a long or a short position in a futures contract. It follows that in  
a risk-neutral world a futures price should have an expected growth rate of zero. (We  
discuss this point in more detail in Section 18.6.) As above, we define p  as the 
 probability of an up movement in the futures price, u as the percentage up movement, 
and d as the percentage down movement. If F0 is the initial futures price, the expected 
futures price at the end of one time step of length ∆t should also be F0. This means that
pF0u+11-p2F0d=F0
so that
p=1-d
u-d
and we can use equations (13.15) to (13.18) with a=1.

SUMMARY
This chapter has provided a first look at the valuation of options on stocks and other 
assets using trees. In the simple situation where movements in the price of a stock  
during the life of an option are governed by a one-step binomial tree, it is possible to set up a riskless portfolio consisting of a position in the stock option and a position in the stock. In a world with no arbitrage opportunities, riskless portfolios must earn the risk-  
free interest. This enables the stock option to be priced in terms of the stock. It is  
 interesting to note that no assumptions are required about the actual (real-world) 
 probabilities of up and down movements in the stock price.
When stock price movements are governed by a multistep binomial tree, we can treat 
each binomial step separately and work back from the end of the life of the option to  
the beginning to obtain the current value of the option. Again only no-arbitrage 
 arguments are used, and no assumptions are required about the actual (real-world) 
probabilities of up and down movements in the stock price.
A very important principle states that we can assume the world is risk-neutral when 
valuing an option. This chapter has shown, through both numerical examples and  algebra, that no-arbitrage arguments and risk-neutral valuation are equivalent and lead 
to the same option prices.
The delta of a stock option, 
∆, considers the effect of a small change in the underlying 
stock price on the change in the option price. It is the ratio of the change in the option price to the change in the stock price. For a riskless position, an investor should buy 
∆ 
shares for each option sold. An inspection of a typical binomial tree shows that delta  
changes during the life of an option. This means that to hedge a particular option  position, we must change our holding in the underlying stock periodically.
Constructing binomial trees for valuing options on stock indices, currencies, and 
futures contracts is very similar to doing so for valuing options on stocks. In Chapter 21,  
we will return to binomial trees and provide more details on how they are used in practice.

APPENDIX 
DERIVATION OF THE BLACK–SCHOLES–MERTON  
OPTION-PRICING FORMULA FROM A BINOMIAL TREE
One way of deriving the famous Black–Scholes–Merton result for valuing a European 
option on a non-dividend-paying stock is by allowing the number of time steps in a binomial tree to approach infinity.
Suppose that a tree with n  time steps is used to value a European call option with 
strike price K  and life T . Each step is of length 
T>n. If there have been j  upward 
 movements and n-j downward movements on the tree, the final stock price is  
S0ujdn-j, where u  is the proportional up movement, d  is the proportional down 
 movement, and S0 is the initial stock price. The payoff from a European call option 
is then
max1S0ujdn-j-K, 02
From the properties of the binomial distribution, the probability of exactly j upward and 
n-j downward movements is given by
n!
1n-j2! j!pj11-p2n-j
It follows that the expected payoff from the call option is
an
j=0n!
1n-j2! j! pj11-p2n-j max1S0ujdn-j-K, 02
As the tree represents movements in a risk-neutral world, we can discount this at the risk-free rate r to obtain the option price:
 
c=e-rTan
j=0n!
1n-j2! j! pj 11-p2n-j max1S0ujdn-j-K, 02 (13A.1)
The terms in equation (13A.1) are nonzero when the final stock price is greater than the 
strike price, that is, when
S0ujdn-j7K
or
ln1S0>K27- j ln1u2-1n-j2 ln1d2
Since u=es2T>n and d=e-s2T>n, this condition becomes
ln1S0>K27ns2T>n-2js2T>n
or
j7n
2-ln1S0>K2
2s2T>n
Equation (13A.1) can therefore be written
c=e-rTa
j7an!
1n-j2! j! pj11-p2n-j1S0ujdn-j-K2
M13_HULL0654_11_GE_C13.indd   312 12/05/2021   17:33Binomial Trees 313
where
a=n
2-ln1S0>K2
2s2T>n
For convenience, we define
 U1=a
j7an!
1n-j2! j! pj11-p2n-jujdn-j (13A.2)
and
 U2=a
j7an!
1n-j2! j! pj11-p2n-j (13A.3)
so that
 c=e-rT1S0U1-KU22 (13A.4)
Consider first U2. As is well known, the binomial distribution approaches a normal 
distribution as the number of trials approaches infinity. Specifically, when there are n 
trials and p is the probability of success, the probability distribution of the number of successes is approximately normal with mean n p and standard deviation 
2n p11-p2. 
The variable U2 in equation (13A.3) is the probability of the number of successes being 
more than a. From the properties of the normal distribution, it follows that, for large n,
 U2=Nan p-a
2n p11-p2b (13A.5)
where N is the cumulative probability distribution function for a standard normal 
 variable. Substituting for a, we obtain
 U2=Naln1S0>K2
2s2T2p11-p2+2n 1p-1
22
2p11-p2b (13A.6)
From equations (13.15) to (13.18), we have
p=erT>n-e-s2T>n
es2T>n-e-s2T>n
By expanding the exponential functions in a series, we see that, as n tends to infinity, 
p11-p2 tends to 1
4 and 2n1p-1
22 tends to
1r-s2>222T
2s
so that in the limit, as n tends to infinity, equation (13A.6) becomes
 U2=Naln1S0>K2+1r-s2>22T
s2Tb (13A.7)
M13_HULL0654_11_GE_C13.indd   313 12/05/2021   17:33314 CHAPTER 13
We now move on to evaluate U1. From equation (13A.2), we have
 U1=a
j7an!
1n-j2! j! 1pu2j311-p2d4n-j (13A.8)
Define
 p*=pu
pu+11-p2d (13A.9)
It then follows that
1-p*=11-p2d
pu+11-p2d
and we can write equation (13A.8) as
U1=3pu+11-p2d4n a
j7an!
1n-j2! j! 1p*2j11-p*2n-j
Since the expected rate of return in the risk-neutral world is the risk-free rate r, it 
 follows that pu+11-p2d=erT>n and
U1=erTa
j7an!
1n-j2! j! 1p*2j11-p*2n-j
This shows that U1 involves a binomial distribution where the probability of an up 
movement is p* rather than p. Approximating the binomial distribution with a normal 
distribution, we obtain, similarly to equation (13A.5),
U1=erT Nan p*-a
2n p*11-p*2b
and substituting for a gives, as with equation (13A.6),
U1=erT Naln1S0>K2
2s2T2p*11-p*2+2n1p*-1
22
2p*11-p*2b
Substituting for u and d in equation (13A.9) gives
p*=aerT>n-e-s2T>n
es2T>n-e-s2T>nbaes2T>n
erT>nb
By expanding the exponential functions in a series we see that, as n tends to infinity, 
p*11-p*2 tends to 1
4 and 2n1p*-1
22 tends to
1r+s2>222T
2s
with the result that
 U1=erT Naln1S0>K2+1r+s2>22T
s2Tb (13A.10)
M13_HULL0654_11_GE_C13.indd   314 12/05/2021   17:33Binomial Trees 315
From equations (13A.4), (13A.7), and (13A.10), we have
c=S0N1d12-Ke-rT N1d22
where
d1=ln1S0>K2+1r+s2>22T
s2T
and
d2=ln1S0>K2+1r-s2>22T
s2T=d1-s2T
This is the Black–Scholes–Merton formula for the valuation of a European call option. 
It will be discussed in Chapter 15. An alternative derivation is given in the appendix to that chapter.

Wiener Processes 
and Itô’s Lemma
Any variable whose value changes over time in an uncertain way is said to follow a 
stochastic process. Stochastic processes can be classified as discrete time or continuous time. A discrete-time stochastic process is one where the value of the variable can change only at certain fixed points in time, whereas a continuous-time stochastic process is one where changes can take place at any time. Stochastic processes can also be classified as continuous variable or discrete variable. In a continuous-variable process, the underlying variable can take any value within a certain range, whereas in a discrete-variable process, only certain discrete values are possible.
This chapter develops a continuous-variable, continuous-time stochastic process for 
stock prices. A similar process is often assumed for the prices of other assets. Learning about this process is the first step to understanding the pricing of options and other more complicated derivatives. It should be noted that, in practice, we do not observe stock prices following continuous-variable, continuous-time processes. Stock prices are restricted to discrete values (e.g., multiples of a cent) and changes can be observed only when the exchange is open for trading. Nevertheless, the continuous-variable, continuous-time process proves to be a useful model for many purposes.
Many people feel that continuous-time stochastic processes are so complicated that 
they should be left entirely to “rocket scientists.” This is not so. The biggest hurdle to understanding these processes is the notation. Here we present a step-by-step approach aimed at getting the reader over this hurdle. We also explain an important result known as Itô’s lemma that is central to the pricing of derivatives.14 CHAPTER  
A Markov process is a particular type of stochastic process where only the current value 
of a variable is relevant for predicting the future. The past history of the variable and the way that the present has emerged from the past are irrelevant.
Stock prices are usually assumed to follow a Markov process. Suppose that the 
price of a stock is $100 now. If the stock price follows a Markov process, our predictions for the future should be unaffected by the price one week ago, one month 14.1 THE MARKOV PROPERTY
M14_HULL0654_11_GE_C14.indd   316 30/04/2021   17:29Wiener Processes and Itô’s Lemma 317
ago, or one year ago. The only relevant piece of information is that the price is now 
$100.1 Predictions for the future are uncertain and must be expressed in terms of 
probability distributions. The Markov property implies that the probability distribu-tion of the price at any particular future time is not dependent on the particular path followed by the price in the past.
The Markov property of stock prices is consistent with the weak form of market 
efficiency. This states that the present price of a stock impounds all the information contained in a record of past prices. If the weak form of market efficiency were not true, technical analysts could make above-average returns by interpreting charts of the past history of stock prices. There is very little evidence that they are in fact able to do this.
It is competition in the marketplace that tends to ensure that weak-form market 
efficiency and the Markov property hold. There are many investors watching the stock market closely. This leads to a situation where a stock price, at any given time, reflects the information in past prices. Suppose that it was discovered that a particular pattern in a stock price always gave a 65% chance of subsequent steep price rises. Investors would attempt to buy a stock as soon as the pattern was observed, and demand for the stock would immediately rise. This would lead to an immediate rise in its price and the observed effect would be eliminated, as would any profitable trading opportunities.
1 Statistical properties of the stock price history may be useful in determining the characteristics of the 
stochastic process followed by the stock price (e.g., its volatility). The point being made here is that the 
particular path followed by the stock in the past is irrelevant.
2 Variance is the square of standard deviation. The standard deviation of a 1-year change in the value of the 
variable we are considering is therefore 1.0.Consider a variable that follows a Markov stochastic process. Suppose that its current 
value is 10 and that the change in its value during a year is f (0, 1), where f (m, v), 
denotes a probability distribution that is normally distributed with mean m  and 
variance v.2 What is the probability distribution of the change in the value of the 
variable during 2 years?
The change in 2 years is the sum of two normal distributions, each of which has a 
mean of zero and variance of 1.0. Because the variable is Markov, the two probability distributions are independent. When we add two independent normal distributions, the result is a normal distribution where the mean is the sum of the means and the variance is the sum of the variances. The mean of the change during 2 years in the variable we are considering is, therefore, zero and the variance of this change is 2.0. Hence, the change in the variable over 2 years has the distribution f (0, 2). The standard deviation 
of the change is 
22.
Consider next the change in the variable during 6 months. The variance of the 
change in the value of the variable during 1 year equals the variance of the change during the first 6 months plus the variance of the change during the second 6 months. We assume these are the same. It follows that the variance of the change during a 6-month period must be 0.5. Equivalently, the standard deviation of the change is 
10.5. 
The probability distribution for the change in the value of the variable during 6 months is f(0, 0.5).14.2 CONTINUOUS-TIME STOCHASTIC PROCESSES
M14_HULL0654_11_GE_C14.indd   317 30/04/2021   17:29318 CHAPTER 14
A similar argument shows that the probability distribution for the change in the 
value of the variable during 3 months is f (0, 0.25). More generally, the change during 
any time period of length T is f (0, T). In particular, the change during a very short time 
period of length ∆t is f(0, ¢t).
Note that, when Markov processes are considered, the variances of the changes in 
successive time periods are additive. The standard deviations of the changes in 
successive time periods are not additive. The variance of the change in the variable in our example is 1.0 per year, so that the variance of the change in 2 years is 2.0 and the variance of the change in 3 years is 3.0. The standard deviations of the changes in 2 and 3 years are 
22 and 23, respectively. Uncertainty is often measured by standard 
deviation. These results therefore explain why uncertainty is sometimes referred to as being proportional to the square root of time.
Wiener Process
The process followed by the variable we have been considering is known as a Wiener process. It is a particular type of Markov stochastic process with a mean change of zero and a variance rate of 1.0 per year. It has been used in physics to describe the motion of a particle that is subject to a large number of small molecular shocks and is sometimes referred to as Brownian motion.
Expressed formally, a variable z follows a Wiener process if it has the following two 
properties:
Property 1. The change 
∆z during a small period of time ∆t is
 ∆z=P2∆t (14.1)
where P has a standard normal distribution f10, 12.
Property 2. The values of ∆z for any two different short intervals of time, ∆t, are 
 independent.
It follows from the first property that ∆z itself has a normal distribution with
 mean of ∆z=0
 standard deviation of ∆z=2∆t
 variance of ∆z=∆t
The second property implies that z follows a Markov process.
Consider the change in the value of z during a relatively long period of time, T. This 
can be denoted by z1T2-z102. It can be regarded as the sum of the changes in z in 
N small time intervals of length ∆t, where
N=T
∆t
Thus,
 z1T2-z102=aN
i=1Pi2∆t (14.2)
where the Pi 1i=1, 2,c, N2 are distributed f10, 12. We know from the second 
property of Wiener processes that the Pi are independent of each other. It follows 
M14_HULL0654_11_GE_C14.indd   318 30/04/2021   17:29Wiener Processes and Itô’s Lemma 319
from equation (14.2) that z1T2-z102 is normally distributed, with
 mean of 3z1T2-z1024=0
 variance of 3z1T2-z1024=N ∆t=T
 standard deviation of 3z1T2-z1024=2T
This is consistent with the discussion earlier in this section.
Example 14.1
Suppose that the value, z, of a variable that follows a Wiener process is initially 25 
and that time is measured in years. At the end of 1 year, the value of the variable  
is normally distributed with a mean of 25 and a standard deviation of 1.0. At the  
end of 5 years, it is normally distributed with a mean of 25 and a standard deviation of 
25, or 2.236. Our uncertainty about the value of the variable at a 
certain time in the future, as measured by its standard deviation, increases as the square root of how far we are looking ahead.
In ordinary calculus, it is usual to proceed from small changes to the limit as the small changes become closer to zero. Thus, 
dx=a dt is the notation used to indicate that 
∆x=a ∆t in the limit as ∆tS0. We use similar notational conventions in stochastic 
calculus. So, when we refer to dz as a Wiener process, we mean that it has the properties for 
∆z given above in the limit as ∆tS0.
Figure 14.1 illustrates what happens to the path followed by z as the limit ∆tS0 is  
approached. Note that the path is quite “jagged.” This is because the standard  deviation of the movement in z in time 
∆t equals 2∆t and, when ∆t is small, 2∆t is 
much bigger than ∆t. Two intriguing properties of Wiener processes, related to this 
2∆t property, are as follows:
1. The expected length of the path followed by z in any time interval is infinite.
2. The expected number of times z  equals any particular value in any time interval is 
infinite.3
Generalized Wiener Process
The mean change per unit time for a stochastic process is known as the drift rate and 
the variance per unit time is known as the variance rate. The basic Wiener process, dz, that has been developed so far has a drift rate of zero and a variance rate of 1.0. The drift rate of zero means that the expected value of z at any future time is equal to its 
current value. The variance rate of 1.0 means that the variance of the change in z in a time interval of length T equals T. A generalized Wiener process for a variable x can be defined in terms of dz as
 
dx=a dt+b dz (14.3)
where a and b are constants.
To understand equation (14.3), it is useful to consider the two components on the 
right-hand side separately. The a dt term implies that x has an expected drift rate of 
a per unit of time. Without the b dz term, the equation is dx=a dt, which implies that 
3 This is because z has some nonzero probability of equaling any value v in the time interval. If it equals v in 
time t, the expected number of times it equals v in the immediate vicinity of t is infinite.

dx>dt=a. Integrating with respect to time, we get
x=x0+at
where x0 is the value of x at time 0. In a period of time of length T, the variable x 
increases by an amount aT. The b dz term on the right-hand side of equation (14.3) can 
be regarded as adding noise or variability to the path followed by x. The amount of this 
noise or variability is b times a Wiener process. A Wiener process has a variance rate per unit time of 1.0. It follows that b times a Wiener process has a variance rate per unit time of 
b2. In a small time interval ∆t, the change ∆x in the value of x is given by 
equations (14.1) and (14.3) as
∆x=a ∆t+bP2∆t
where, as before, P has a standard normal distribution f10, 12. Thus ∆x has a normal 
distribution with
 mean of ∆x=a ∆t
 standard deviation of ∆x=b2∆t
 variance of ∆x=b2∆t
Similar arguments to those given for a Wiener process show that the change in the value of x in any time interval T is normally distributed with
 mean of change in x=aT
 standard deviation of change in x=b2T
 variance of change in x=b2T
To summarize, the generalized Wiener process given in equation (14.3) has an expected drift rate (i.e., average drift per unit of time) of a and a variance rate (i.e., variance per unit of time) of 
b2. It is illustrated in Figure 14.2.

Example 14.2
Consider the situation where the cash position of a company, measured in thou-
sands of dollars, follows a generalized Wiener process with a drift of 20 per year and a variance rate of 900 per year. Initially, the cash position is 50. At the end of 1 year the cash position will have a normal distribution with a mean of 70 and a standard deviation of 
2900, or 30. At the end of 6 months it will have a normal 
distribution with a mean of 60 and a standard deviation of 3020.5=21.21. Our 
uncertainty about the cash position at some time in the future, as measured by its standard deviation, increases as the square root of how far ahead we are looking. (Note that the cash position can become negative. We can interpret this as a situation where the company is borrowing funds.)
Itô Process
A further type of stochastic process, known as an Itô process, can be defined. This is a generalized Wiener process in which the parameters a and b are functions of the value of the underlying variable x and time t. An Itô process can therefore be written as
 
dx=a1x, t2dt+b1x, t2 dz (14.4)
Both the expected drift rate and variance rate of an Itô process are liable to change over 
time. They are functions of the current value of x and the current time, t. In a small time interval between t and 
t+∆t, the variable changes from x to x+∆x, where
∆x=a1x, t2∆t+b1x, t2P2∆t
This equation involves a small approximation. It assumes that the drift and variance rate of x remain constant, equal to their values at time t , in the time interval between t  and 
t+∆t.
Note that the process in equation (14.4) is Markov because the change in x at time t 
depends only on the value of x at time t, not on its history. A non-Markov process could be defined by letting a and b in equation (14.4) depend on values of x prior to time t.
In this section we discuss the stochastic process usually assumed for the price of a non- 
dividend-paying stock.
It is tempting to suggest that a stock price follows a generalized Wiener process; that is, 
that it has a constant expected drift rate and a constant variance rate. However, this model fails to capture a key aspect of stock prices. This is that the expected percentage return required by investors from a stock is independent of the stock’s price. If investors require a 14% per annum expected return when the stock price is $10, then, ceteris paribus, they will also require a 14% per annum expected return when it is $50.
Clearly, the assumption of constant expected drift rate is inappropriate and needs to 
be replaced by the assumption that the expected return (i.e., expected drift divided by the stock price) is constant. If S is the stock price at time t, then the expected drift rate in S should be assumed to be 
mS for some constant parameter m. This means that in a 
short interval of time, ∆t, the expected increase in S is mS ∆t. The parameter m is the 
expected rate of return on the stock.14.3 THE PROCESS FOR A STOCK PRICE
M14_HULL0654_11_GE_C14.indd   322 30/04/2021   17:29Wiener Processes and Itô’s Lemma 323
If the coefficient of dz is zero, so that there is no uncertainty, then this model implies 
that
∆S=mS ∆t
in the limit, as ∆tS0, so that:
dS=mS dt
or
dS
S=m dt
Integrating between time 0 and time T, we get
 ST=S0emT (14.5)
where S0 and ST are the stock price at time 0 and time T. Equation (14.5) shows that, 
when there is no uncertainty, the stock price grows at a continuously compounded rate 
of m per unit of time.
In practice, of course, there is uncertainty. A reasonable assumption is that the 
variability of the return in a short period of time, ∆t, is the same regardless of the 
stock price. In other words, an investor is just as uncertain about the return when the stock price is $50 as when it is $10. This suggests that the standard deviation of the change in a short period of time 
∆t should be proportional to the stock price and leads 
to the model
dS=mS dt+sS dz
or
 dS
S=m dt+s dz (14.6)
Equation  (14.6) is the most widely used model of stock price behavior. The variable m is 
the stock’s expected rate of return. The variable s is the volatility of the stock price. The 
variable s2 is referred to as its variance rate. The model in equation (14.6) represents 
the stock price process in the real world. In a risk-neutral world, m equals the risk-free 
rate r.
Discrete-Time Model
The model of stock price behavior we have developed is known as geometric Brownian 
motion. The discrete-time version of the model is
 ∆S
S=m ∆t+sP2∆t (14.7)
or
 ∆S=mS ∆t+sSP2∆t (14.8)
The variable ∆S is the change in the stock price S in a small time interval ∆t, and as 
before P has a standard normal distribution (i.e., a normal distribution with a mean of 
zero and standard deviation of 1.0). The parameter m is the expected rate of return per 
unit of time from the stock. The parameter s is the stock price volatility. In this chapter 
we will assume these parameters are constant.
The left-hand side of equation (14.7) is the discrete approximation to the return 
provided by the stock in a short period of time, ∆t. The term m ∆t is the expected value 
of this return, and the term sP2∆t is the stochastic component of the return. The 
M14_HULL0654_11_GE_C14.indd   323 30/04/2021   17:29324 CHAPTER 14
variance of the stochastic component (and, therefore, of the whole return) is s2∆t. This 
is consistent with the definition of the volatility s given in Section 13.7; that is, s is such 
that s2∆t is the standard deviation of the return in a short time period ∆t.
Equation (14.7) shows that ∆S>S is approximately normally distributed with mean 
m ∆t and standard deviation s2∆t. In other words,
 ∆S
S/similar.altf1m ∆t, s2 ∆t2 (14.9)
Example 14.3
Consider a stock that pays no dividends, has a volatility of 30% per annum, and 
provides an expected return of 15% per annum with continuous compounding. In this case, 
m=0.15 and s=0.30. The process for the stock price is
dS
S=0.15 dt+0.30 dz
If S is the stock price at a particular time and ∆S is the increase in the stock price 
in the next small interval of time, the discrete approximation to the process is
∆S
S=0.15∆t+0.30P2∆t
where P has a standard normal distribution. Consider a time interval of 1 week, 
or 0.0192 year, so that ∆t=0.0192. Then the approximation gives
∆S
S=0.15*0.0192+0.30*20.0192P
or
∆S=0.00288S+0.0416SP
Monte Carlo Simulation
A Monte Carlo simulation of a stochastic process is a procedure for sampling random outcomes for the process. We will use it as a way of developing some understanding of the nature of the stock price process in equation  (14.6).
Consider the situation in Example 14.3 where the expected return from a stock is 
15% per annum and the volatility is 30% per annum. The stock price change over 1 week was shown to be approximately
 
∆S=0.00288S+0.0416SP (14.10)
A path for the stock price over 10 weeks can be simulated by sampling repeatedly for P 
from f10, 12 and substituting into equation  (14.10). The expression = RAND() in Excel 
produces a random sample between 0 and 1. The inverse cumulative normal distribution 
is NORMSINV. The instruction to produce a random sample from a standard normal distribution in Excel is therefore = NORMSINV(RAND()). Table 14.1 shows one path 
for a stock price that was sampled in this way. The initial stock price is assumed to be $100. For the first period, 
P is sampled as 0.52. From equation (14.10), the change during 
the first time period is
∆S=0.00288*100+0.0416*100*0.52=2.45
Therefore, at the beginning of the second time period, the stock price is $102.45. The 
M14_HULL0654_11_GE_C14.indd   324 30/04/2021   17:29Wiener Processes and Itô’s Lemma 325
value of P sampled for the next period is 1.44. From equation (14.10), the change during 
the second time period is
∆S=0.00288*102.45+0.0416*102.45*1.44=6.43
So, at the beginning of the next period, the stock price is $108.88, and so on.4 Note 
that, because the process we are simulating is Markov, the samples for P should be 
independent of each other.
Table 14.1 assumes that stock prices are measured to the nearest cent. It is important 
to realize that the table shows only one possible pattern of stock price movements. Different random samples would lead to different price movements. Any small time interval 
∆t can be used in the simulation. In the limit as ∆tS0, a perfect description 
of the stochastic process is obtained. The final stock price of 111.54 in Table 14.1 can be regarded as a random sample from the distribution of stock prices at the end of 10 weeks. By repeatedly simulating movements in the stock price, a complete prob-ability distribution of the stock price at the end of this time is obtained. Monte Carlo simulation is discussed in more detail in Chapter 21.Stock price

4 In practice, it is more efficient to sample ln S rather than S, as will be discussed in Section 21.6.The process for a stock price developed in this chapter involves two parameters, m and s. 
The parameter m is the expected return (annualized) earned by an investor in a short 
period of time. Most investors require higher expected returns to induce them to take higher risks. It follows that the value of 
m should depend on the risk of the return from 
the stock.5 It should also depend on the level of interest rates in the economy. The higher 
the level of interest rates, the higher the expected return required on any given stock.14.4 THE PARAMETERS
5 More precisely, m depends on that part of the risk that cannot be diversified away by the investor.
M14_HULL0654_11_GE_C14.indd   325 30/04/2021   17:29326 CHAPTER 14
Fortunately, we do not have to concern ourselves with the determinants of m in any 
detail because the value of a derivative dependent on a stock is, in general, independent 
of m. The parameter s, the stock price volatility, is, by contrast, critically important to 
the determination of the value of many derivatives. We will discuss procedures for estimating 
s in Chapter 15. Typical values of s for a stock are in the range 0.15 to 0.60 
(i.e., 15% to 60%).
The standard deviation of the proportional change in the stock price in a small 
interval of time ∆t is s2∆t. As a rough approximation, the standard deviation of the 
proportional change in the stock price over a relatively long period of time T is s2T. 
This means that, as an approximation, volatility can be interpreted as the standard deviation of the change in the stock price in 1 year. In Chapter 15, we will show that the volatility of a stock price is exactly equal to the standard deviation of the continuously compounded return provided by the stock in 1 year.
So far we have considered how the stochastic process for a single variable can be 
represented. We now extend the analysis to the situation where there are two or more variables following correlated stochastic processes. Suppose that the processes followed by two variables 
x1 and x2 are
dx1=a1 dt+b1 dz1 and dx2=a2 dt+b2 dz2
where dz1 and dz2 are Wiener processes.
As has been explained, the discrete-time approximations for these processes are
∆x1=a1 ∆t+b1 P12∆t and ∆x2=a2 ∆t+b2 P22∆t
where P1 and P2 are samples from a standard normal distribution f10, 12.
The variables x1 and x2 can be simulated in the way described in Section 14.3. If they 
are uncorrelated with each other, the random samples P1 and P2 that are used to obtain 
movements in a particular period of time ∆t should be independent of each other.
If x1 and x2 have a nonzero correlation r, then the P1 and P2 that are used to obtain 
movements in a particular period of time should be sampled from a bivariate normal distribution. Each variable in the bivariate normal distribution has a standard normal distribution and the correlation between the variables is 
r. In this situation, we would 
refer to the Wiener processes dz1 and dz2 as having a correlation r.
Obtaining samples for uncorrelated standard normal variables in cells in Excel 
involves putting the instruction “=NORMSINV(RAND())” in each of the cells. To sample standard normal variables 
P1 and P2 with correlation r, we can set
P1=u and P2=ru+21-r2v
where u and v  are sampled as uncorrelated variables with standard normal distributions.
Note that, in the processes we have assumed for x1 and x2, the parameters a1, a2, b1, 
and b2 can be functions of x1, x2, and t. In particular, a1 and b1 can be functions of x2 
as well as x1 and t; and a2 and b2 can be functions of x1 as well as x2 and t.14.5 CORRELATED PROCESSES
M14_HULL0654_11_GE_C14.indd   326 30/04/2021   17:30Wiener Processes and Itô’s Lemma 327
The results here can be generalized. When there are three different variables following 
correlated stochastic processes, we have to sample three different P>s. These have a 
trivariate normal distribution. When there are n  correlated variables, we have n  different 
P>s and these must be sampled from an appropriate multivariate normal distribution. 
The way this is done is explained in Chapter 21.
The price of a stock option is a function of the underlying stock’s price and time. More 
generally, we can say that the price of any derivative is a function of the stochastic variables underlying the derivative and time. A serious student of derivatives must, therefore, acquire some understanding of the behavior of functions of stochastic variables. An important result in this area was discovered by the mathematician K. Itô in 1951,
6 and is known as Itô’s lemma.
Suppose that the value of a variable x follows the Itô process
 dx=a1x, t2 dt+b1x, t2 dz (14.11)
where dz is a Wiener process and a and b are functions of x and t. The variable x has a 
drift rate of a and a variance rate of b2. Itô’s lemma shows that a function G of x and t 
follows the process
 dG=a0G
0x a+0G
0t+1
2 02G
0x2 b2bdt+0G
0x b dz (14.12)
where the dz is the same Wiener process as in equation (14.11). Thus, G  also follows an 
Itô process, with a drift rate of
0G
0xa+0G
0t+1
2 02G
0x2 b2
and a variance rate of
a0G
0xb2
 b2
A completely rigorous proof of Itô’s lemma is beyond the scope of this book. In the 
appendix to this chapter, we show that the lemma can be viewed as an extension of well-known results in differential calculus.
Earlier, we argued that
 
dS=mS dt+sS dz (14.13)
with m and s constant, is a reasonable model of stock price movements. From Itô’s 
lemma, it follows that the process followed by a function G of S and t is
 dG=a0G
0SmS+0G
0t+1
2 02G
0S2s2S2b dt+0G
0SsS dz (14.14)
Note that both S and G are affected by the same underlying source of uncertainty, dz. 
This proves to be very important in the derivation of the Black–Scholes–Merton results.14.6 IT Ô’S LEMMA

Application to Forward Contracts
To illustrate Itô’s lemma, consider a forward contract on a non-dividend-paying stock. 
Assume that the risk-free rate of interest is constant and equal to r for all maturities. From equation (5.1),
F0=S0erT
where F0 is the forward price at time zero, S0 is the spot price at time zero, and T is the 
time to maturity of the forward contract.
We are interested in what happens to the forward price as time passes. We define F  as 
the forward price at a general time t, and S as the stock price at time t, with t6T. The 
relationship between F and S is given by
 F=Ser1T-t2 (14.15)
Assuming that the process for S is given by equation (14.13), we can use Itô’s lemma to 
determine the process for F. From equation (14.15),
0F
0S=er1T-t2,  02F
0S2=0,  0F
0t=-rSer1T-t2
From equation (14.14), the process for F is given by
dF=3er1T-t2mS-rSer1T-t24dt+er1T-t2sS dz
Substituting F for Ser1T-t2 gives
 dF=1m-r2F dt+sF dz (14.16)
Like S, the forward price F follows geometric Brownian motion. It has the same 
volatility as S and an expected growth rate of m-r rather than m.
We now use Itô’s lemma to derive the process followed by ln S  when S  follows the process 
in equation (14.13). We define
G=ln S
Since
0G
0S=1
S,  02G
0S2=-1
S2,  0G
0t=0
it follows from equation (14.14) that the process followed by G is
 dG=am-s2
2b dt+s dz (14.17)
Since m and s are constant, this equation indicates that G=ln S follows a generalized 
Wiener process. It has constant drift rate m-s2>2 and constant variance rate s2. The 14.7 THE LOGNORMAL PROPERTY
M14_HULL0654_11_GE_C14.indd   328 30/04/2021   17:30Wiener Processes and Itô’s Lemma 329
change in ln S between time 0 and some future time T is therefore normally distributed, 
with mean 1m-s2>22T and variance s2T. This means that
 ln ST-ln S0/similar.altfcam-s2
2bT, s2Td (14.18)
or
 ln ST/similar.altfcln S0+am-s2
2bT, s2Td (14.19)
where ST is the stock price at time T, S0 is the stock price at time 0, and as before f1m, v2 
denotes a normal distribution with mean m and variance v.
Equation (14.19) shows that ln ST is normally distributed. A variable has a lognormal 
distribution if the natural logarithm of the variable is normally distributed. The model 
of stock price behavior we have developed in this chapter therefore implies that a stock’s price at time T, given its price today, is lognormally distributed. The standard deviation 
of the logarithm of the stock price is 
s2T. It is proportional to the square root of how 
far ahead we are looking.
Fractional Brownian motion (also known as fractal Brownian motion) provides a 
generalization of Brownian motion and the models involving Wiener processes that we have discussed so far in this chapter. It is used in rough volatility models for valuing derivatives, which are discussed later in the book.
First, let us quickly review the properties of Wiener processes. Suppose dz is a Wiener 
process, 
s is a constant, and
X=s dz
with X102=0. Then, for t7s70,
E3X1t2-X1s24=0 and E31X1t2-X1s2224=s21t-s2
In particular, E31X1t2224=s2t and E31X1s2224=s2s. The variance of the change in X 
between times s and t is
E31X1t2-X1s2224-1E3X1t2-X1s2422=s21t-s2
The variance per unit time is therefore constant and equal to s2. Because a Wiener 
process is Markov, X1t2-X1s2 is uncorrelated with X1s2. Hence,
 E3X1s2X1t24=E3X1s21X 1s2+X1t2-X1s224
 =E31X1s2224+E3X1s21X 1t2-X1s224
 =E31X1s2224=s2s
In fractional Brownian motion we assume
E31X1t2-X1s2224=s21t-s22H
where H is referred to as the Hurst exponent. Continuing with the assumption that 14.8 FRACTIONAL BROWNIAN MOTION
M14_HULL0654_11_GE_C14.indd   329 30/04/2021   17:30330 CHAPTER 14
X102=0, E31X1t224=s2t2H, and E31X1s224=s2s2H. When H =  0.5, fractional Brownian 
motion becomes regular Brownian motion.
Since
E31X1t2-X1s2224=E31X1t2224+E31X1s2224-2E3X1t2X1s24
it follows that
 E3X1t2X1s24=0.55E31X1t2224+E31X1s2224-E31X1t2-X1s22246
 =0.5s23t2H+s2H-1t-s22H4
When H=0.5, this reduces to our earlier result for Wiener processes: E3X1s2X1t24 = s2s. 
The correlation between X1t2 and X1s2 is
 0.53t2H+s2H-1t-s22H4
sHtH (14.20)
Fractional Brownian motion is non-Markov. If t7s7u, then
 E31X1t2-X1s221X 1s2-X1u224=E3X1t2X1s24-E31X1s2224
-E3X1t2X1u24+E3X1s2X1u24 =0.5s231t-u22H-1t-s22H-1s-u22H4
This is zero (as we expect) when H=0.5. When H70.5, it is positive (so that the 
correlation between changes in X in successive periods of time is positive). When 
H60.5, it is negative (so that the correlation between changes in X in successive 
periods of time is negative).
Simulating fractional Brownian motion involves dividing the time period being 
considered into a number of small time steps of length ∆t. A sample from a standard 
normal distribution, P, determines the change over one time step using equation (14.8). 
In regular Brownian motion the P>s used for different time steps are uncorrelated. In 
fractional Brownian motion we must build in the correlations so that equation (14.20) is 
satisfied. The P for the first step is chosen randomly; the P for the second step must be 
chosen so that X12∆t2 has the right correlation with X1∆t2; the P for the third time step 
must be chosen so that X13∆t2 has the right correlation with both x12∆t2 and the 
X1∆t2; and so on. The Cholesky decomposition procedure explained in Chapter 21, can 
be used to accomplish this.
Figure 14.3 shows the simulation of fractional Brownian motion over one year for 
values of H equal to 0.9, 0.5, and 0.1 when the time step is 0.01 years. As H decreases, the process becomes more noisy. This would become even more marked if we decreased the length of the time step further.
SUMMARY
Stochastic processes describe the probabilistic evolution of the value of a variable through time. A Markov process is one where only the present value of the variable is relevant for predicting the future. The past history of the variable and the way in which the present has emerged from the past is irrelevant.

A Wiener process dz is a Markov process describing the evolution of a normally 
distributed variable. The drift of the process is zero and the variance rate is 1.0 per unit 
time. This means that, if the value of the variable is x0 at time 0, then at time T it is 
normally distributed with mean x0 and standard deviation 2T.
A generalized Wiener process describes the evolution of a normally distributed 
variable with a drift of a per unit time and a variance rate of b2 per unit time, where 
a and b are constants. This means that if, as before, the value of the variable is x0 at 
time 0, it is normally distributed with a mean of x0+aT and a standard deviation of 
b2T at time T.
An Itô process is a process where the drift and variance rate of x can be a function of 
both x itself and time. The change in x in a very short period of time is, to a good 
approximation, normally distributed, but its change over longer periods of time is liable to be nonnormal.
One way of gaining an intuitive understanding of a stochastic process for a variable is 
to use Monte Carlo simulation. This involves dividing a time interval into many small time steps and randomly sampling possible paths for the variable. The future prob-ability distribution for the variable can then be calculated. Monte Carlo simulation is discussed further in Chapter 21.
Itô’s lemma is a way of calculating the stochastic process followed by a function of a  
variable from the stochastic process followed by the variable itself. As we shall see in  
Chapter 15, Itô’s lemma plays a very important part in the pricing of derivatives.  
A key point is that the Wiener process dz underlying the stochastic process for the variable is exactly the same as the Wiener process underlying the stochastic process for  
the function of the variable. Both are subject to the same underlying source of  
uncertainty.
The stochastic process usually assumed for a stock price is geometric Brownian 
motion. Under this process the return to the holder of the stock in a small period of  
time is normally distributed and the returns in two nonoverlapping periods are  
independent. The value of the stock price at a future time has a lognormal distribution. The Black–Scholes–Merton model, which we cover in the next chapter, is based on the geometric Brownian motion assumption.

APPENDIX 
A NONRIGOROUS DERIVATION OF IT Ô’S LEMMA
In this appendix, we show how Itô’s lemma can be regarded as a natural extension of  
other, simpler results. Consider a continuous and differentiable function G of a 
variable x. If ∆x is a small change in x and ∆G is the resulting small change in G, a 
well-known result from ordinary calculus is
 ∆G≈dG
dx∆x (14A.1)
In other words, ∆G is approximately equal to the rate of change of G with respect to x 
multiplied by ∆x. The error involves terms of order ∆x2. If more precision is required, a 
Taylor series expansion of ∆G can be used:
∆G=dG
dx∆x+1
2 d2G
dx2∆x2+1
6 d3G
dx3∆x3+g
For a continuous and differentiable function G of two variables x and y, the result 
analogous to equation (14A. 1) is
 ∆G≈0G
0x∆x+0G
0y∆y (14A.2)
and the Taylor series expansion of ∆G is
        ∆G=0G
0x∆x+0G
0y∆y+1
2 02G
0x2∆x2+02G
0x0y∆x∆y+1
2 02G
0y2∆y2+g (14A.3)
In the limit, as ∆x and ∆y tend to zero, equation (14A. 3) becomes
 dG=0G
0x dx+0G
0y dy (14A.4)
We now extend equation (14A. 4) to cover functions of variables following Itô processes. 
Suppose that a variable x follows the Itô process
 dx=a1x, t2 dt+b1x, t2 dz (14A.5)
and that G is some function of x and of time t. By analogy with equation (14A. 3), we 
can write
         ∆G=0G
0x∆x+0G
0t∆t+1
2 02G
0x2∆x2+02G
0x 0t∆x∆t+1
2 02G
0t2∆t2+g (14A.6)
Equation (14A.5) can be discretized to
∆x=a1x, t2∆t+b1x, t2P2∆t
or, if arguments are dropped,
 ∆x=a∆t+bP2∆t (14A.7)
M14_HULL0654_11_GE_C14.indd   336 30/04/2021   17:30Wiener Processes and Itô’s Lemma 337
This equation reveals an important difference between the situation in equation (14A. 6) 
and the situation in equation (14A. 3). When limiting arguments were used to move  
from equation (14A. 3) to equation (14A. 4), terms in ∆x2 were ignored because they 
were second-order terms. From equation (14A. 7), we have
 ∆x2=b2P2∆t+terms of higher order in ∆t (14A.8)
This shows that the term involving ∆x2 in equation (14A. 6) has a component that is of 
order ∆t and cannot be ignored.
The variance of a standard normal distribution is 1.0. This means that
E1P22-3E1P242=1
where E denotes expected value. Since E1P2=0, it follows that E1P22=1. The expected  
value of P2∆t, therefore, is ∆t. The variance of P2∆t is, from the properties of the  
standard normal distribution, 2∆t2. We know that the variance of the change in a 
stochastic variable in time ∆t is proportional to ∆t, not ∆t2. The variance of P2∆t is 
therefore too small for it to have a stochastic component. As a result, we can treat P2∆t 
as nonstochastic and equal to its expected value, ∆t, as ∆t tends to zero. It follows from 
equation (14A. 8) that ∆x2 becomes nonstochastic and equal to b2dt as ∆t tends to zero. 
Taking limits as ∆x and ∆t tend to zero in equation (14A. 6), and using this last result, 
we obtain
 dG=0G
0xdx+0G
0tdt+1
2 02G
0x2b2dt (14A.9)
This is Itô’s lemma. If we substitute for dx from equation (14A. 5), equation (14A. 9) 
becomes
dG=a0G
0xa+0G
0t+1
2 02G
0x2b2b dt+0G
0xb dz.
Technical Note 29 at www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull/TechnicalNotes provides

and

In the early 1970s, Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert Merton achieved a major 
breakthrough in the pricing of European stock options.1 This was the development of 
what has become known as the Black–Scholes–Merton (or Black–Scholes) model. The model has had a huge influence on the way that traders price and hedge derivatives. In 1997, the importance of the model was recognized when Robert Merton and Myron Scholes were awarded the Nobel prize for economics. Sadly, Fischer Black died in 1995; otherwise he too would undoubtedly have been one of the recipients of this prize.
How did Black, Scholes, and Merton make their breakthrough? Previous researchers 
had made similar assumptions and had correctly calculated the expected payoff from a European option. However, as explained in Section 13.2, it is difficult to know the  
correct discount rate to use for this payoff. Black and Scholes used the capital asset pricing model (see the appendix to Chapter 3) to determine a relationship between the market’s required return on the option and the required return on the stock. This was not easy because the relationship depends on both the stock price and time. Merton’s approach was different from that of Black and Scholes. It involved setting up a riskless portfolio consisting of the option and the underlying stock and arguing that the return on the portfolio over a short period of time must be the risk-free return. This is similar to what we did in Section 13.1 —but more complicated because the portfolio changes continuously through time. Merton’s approach was more general than that of Black and Scholes because it did not rely on the assumptions of the capital asset pricing model.
This chapter covers Merton’s approach to deriving the Black–Scholes–Merton 
model. It explains how volatility can be either estimated from historical data or implied from option prices using the model. It shows how the risk-neutral valuation argument introduced in Chapter 13 can be used. It also shows how the Black–Scholes–Merton model can be extended to deal with European call and put options on dividend-paying stocks and presents some results on the pricing of American call options on dividend-  
paying stocks.The Black–

The model of stock price behavior used by Black, Scholes, and Merton is the model we 
developed in Chapter 14. It assumes that percentage changes in the stock price in a very short period of time are normally distributed. Define
 
m: Expected return in a short period of time (annualized)
 s: Volatility of the stock price.
The mean and standard deviation of the return in time ∆t are approximately m ∆t and 
s2∆t, so that
 ∆S
S/similar.altf1m∆t, s2∆t2 (15. 1)
where ∆S is the change in the stock price S in time ∆t, and f1m, v2 denotes a normal 
distribution with mean m and variance v. (This is equation (14.9).)
As shown in Section 14.7, the model implies that
ln ST-ln S0/similar.altfcam-s2
2bT, s2Td
so that
 ln ST
S0/similar.altfcam-s2
2bT, s2Td (15. 2)
and 
ln ST/similar.altfcln S0+am-s2
2bT, s2Td (15. 3)
where ST is the stock price at a future time T and S0 is the stock price at time 0. There is 
no approximation here. The variable ln ST is normally distributed, so that ST has a  
lognormal distribution. The mean of ln ST is ln S0+1m-s2>22T and the standard 
deviation of ln ST is s2T.
Example 15.1
Consider a stock with an initial price of $40, an expected return of 16% per 
annum, and a volatility of 20% per annum. From equation (15.3), the probability distribution of the stock price 
ST in 6 months’ time is given by
ln ST/similar.altf3ln 40+10.16-0.22>22*0.5, 0.22*0.54
ln ST/similar.altf13.759, 0.022
There is a 95% probability that a normally distributed variable has a value within 1.96 standard deviations of its mean. In this case, the standard deviation is 
20.02=0.141. Hence, with 95% confidence,
3.759-1.96*0.1416ln ST63.759+1.96*0.141
This can be written
e3.759-1.96*0.1416ST6e3.759+1.96*0.141
or
32.556ST656.56
Thus, there is a 95% probability that the stock price in 6 months will lie between 32.55 and 56.56.15.1 LOGNORMAL PROPERTY OF STOCK PRICES

A variable that has a lognormal distribution can take any value between zero and 
 infinity. Figure 15.1 illustrates the shape of a lognormal distribution. Unlike the normal 
distribution, it is skewed so that the mean, median, and mode are all different. From equation (15.3) and the properties of the lognormal distribution, it can be shown that the expected value 
E1ST2 of ST is given by
 E1ST2=S0emT (15. 4)
The variance var1ST2 of ST, can be shown to be given by2
 var1ST2=S02e2mT1es2T-12 (15. 5)
Example 15.2
Consider a stock where the current price is $20, the expected return is 20% per annum, and the volatility is 40% per annum. The expected stock price, 
E1ST2, and 
the variance of the stock price, var1ST2, in 1 year are given by
E1ST2=20e0.2*1=24.43 and var1ST2=400e2*0.2*11e0.42*1-12=103.54
The standard deviation of the stock price in 1 year is 2103.54, or 10.18.0Figure 15.1 Lognormal distribution.
2 See Technical Note 2 at www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull/TechnicalNotes for a proof of the results in  
equations (15.4) and (15.5). For a more extensive discussion of the properties of the lognormal distribution, 
see J. Aitchison and J. A. C. Brown, The Lognormal Distribution. Cambridge University Press, 1966.The lognormal property of stock prices can be used to provide information on the 
probability distribution of the continuously compounded rate of return earned on a stock between times 0 and T. If we define the continuously compounded rate of return per annum realized between times 0 and T as x, then

From equation (15.2), it follows that
 x/similar.altfam-s2

Tb (15. 7)
Thus, the continuously compounded rate of return per annum is normally distributed 
with mean m-s2>2 and standard deviation s>1T. As T increases, the standard 
deviation of x  declines. To understand the reason for this, consider two cases: T=1 
and T=20. We are more certain about the average return per year over 20 years than 
we are about the return in any one year.
Example 15.3
Consider a stock with an expected return of 17% per annum and a volatility of 
20% per annum. The probability distribution for the average rate of return (con-tinuously compounded) realized over 3 years is normal, with mean
0.17-0.22
2=0.15
or 15% per annum, and standard deviation
B0.22
3=0.1155
or 11.55% per annum. Because there is a 95% chance that a normally distributed variable will lie within 1.96 standard deviations of its mean, we can be 95%  
confident that the average continuously compounded return realized over 3 years will be between 15 - 1.96 * 11.55 = -7.6% and 15 + 1.96 * 11.55 = +37.6% per 
annum.
The expected return, 
m, required by investors from a stock depends on the riskiness of 
the stock. The higher the risk, the higher the expected return. It also depends on the level of interest rates in the economy. The higher the level of interest rates, the higher the expected return required on any given stock. Fortunately, we do not have to concern ourselves with the determinants of 
m in any detail. It turns out that the value of a stock 
option, when expressed in terms of the value of the underlying stock, does not depend on 
m at all. Nevertheless, there is one aspect of the expected return from a stock that 
frequently causes confusion and needs to be explained.
Our model of stock price behavior implies that, in a very short period of time ∆t, the 
mean return is m ∆t. It is natural to assume from this that m is the expected  
continuously compounded return on the stock. However, this is not the case. The  
continuously compounded return, x, actually realized over a period of time of length T 15.3 THE EXPECTED RETURN
M15_HULL0654_11_GE_C15.indd   341 12/05/2021   17:40342 CHAPTER 15
is given by equation (15.6) as
x=1
TlnST
S0
and, as indicated in equation (15.7), the expected value E1x2 of x is m-s2>2.
The reason why the expected continuously compounded return is different from m is 
subtle, but important. Suppose we consider a very large number of very short periods of 
time of length ∆t. Define Si as the stock price at the end of the i th interval and ∆Si as 
Si+1-Si. Under the assumptions we are making for stock price behavior, the arithmetic 
average of the returns on the stock in each interval is close to m. In other words, m ∆t is 
close to the arithmetic mean of the ∆Si>Si. However, the expected return over the whole 
period covered by the data, expressed with a compounding interval of ∆t, is a geometric 
average and is close to m-s2>2, not m.3 Business Snapshot 15. 1 provides a numerical 
example concerning the mutual fund industry to illustrate why this is so.
For another explanation of what is going on, we start with equation (15.4):
E1ST2=S0emT
Taking logarithms, we get
ln3E1ST24=ln1S02+mT
It is now tempting to set ln3E1ST24=E3ln1ST24, so that E3ln1ST24-ln1S02=mT, or 
E3ln1ST>S024=mT, which leads to E1x2=m. However, we cannot do this because ln 
is a nonlinear function. In fact, ln3E1ST247E3ln1ST24, so that E3ln1ST>S0246mT, which 
leads to E1x26m. (As shown above, E1x2=m-s2>2.)
3 The arguments in this section show that the term “expected return” is ambiguous. It can refer either to m or 
to m-s2>2. Unless otherwise stated, it will be used to refer to m throughout this book.The volatility, s, of a stock is a measure of our uncertainty about the returns provided 
by the stock. Stocks typically have a volatility between 15% and 60%.
From equation (15.7), the volatility of a stock price can be defined as the standard 
deviation of the return provided by the stock in 1 year when the return is expressed using continuous compounding.
When 
∆t is small, equation (15.1) shows that s2∆t is approximately equal to the 
variance of the percentage change in the stock price in time ∆t. This means that s2∆t is 
approximately equal to the standard deviation of the percentage change in the stock price in time 
∆t. Suppose that s=0.3, or 30%, per annum and the current stock price 
is $50. The standard deviation of the percentage change in the stock price in 1 week is approximately
30*A1
52=4.16,
A 1 -standard-deviation move in the stock price in 1 week is therefore 50*0.0416=2.08.
Uncertainty about a future stock price, as measured by its standard deviation, 
increases—at least approximately—with the square root of how far ahead we are  
looking. For example, the standard deviation of the stock price in 4 weeks is approxi-mately twice the standard deviation in 1 week.15.4 VOLATILITY

Business Snapshot 15.1 Mutual Fund Returns Can Be Misleading
The difference between m and m-s2>2 is closely related to an issue in the reporting of 
mutual fund returns. Suppose that the following is a sequence of returns per annum 
reported by a mutual fund manager over the last five years (measured using annual compounding): 
15,, 20,, 30,, -20,, 25,.
The arithmetic mean of the returns, calculated by taking the sum of the returns 
and dividing by 5, is 14%. However, an investor would actually earn less than 14% per annum by leaving the money invested in the fund for 5 years. The dollar value of $100 at the end of the 5 years would be
100*1.15*1.20*1.30*0.80*1.25=+179.40
By contrast, a 14% return with annual compounding would give
100*1.145=+192.54
The return that gives $179.40 at the end of five years is 12.4%. This is because
100*11.12425=179.40
What average return should the fund manager report? It is tempting for the manager to make a statement such as: “The average of the returns per year that we have realized in the last 5 years is 14%. ” Although true, this is misleading. It is much less misleading to say: “The average return realized by someone who invested with us for the last 5 years is 12.4% per year. ” In some jurisdictions, regulations require fund managers to report returns the second way.
This phenomenon is an example of a result that is well known in mathematics. The 
geometric mean of a set of numbers is always less than the arithmetic mean. In our example, the return multipliers each year are 1.15, 1.20, 1.30, 0.80, and 1.25. The arithmetic mean of these numbers is 1.140, but the geometric mean is only 1.124 and it is the geometric mean that equals 1 plus the return realized over the 5 years.
Estimating Volatility from Historical Data
To estimate the volatility of a stock price empirically, the stock price is usually observed at fixed intervals of time (e.g., every day, week, or month). Define:
 
n+1: Number of observations
 Si  : Stock price at end of ith interval, with i=0, 1,c, n
 t : Length of time interval in years
and let
ui=lnaSi
Si-1b for i=1, 2,c, n
The usual estimate, s, of the standard deviation of the ui is given by
s=A1
n-1an
i=1 1ui-u22

or
s=B1
n-1an
i=1 u2
i-1
n1n-12aan
i=1 uib2
where u is the mean of the ui.4
From equation (15.2), the standard deviation of the ui is s1t. The variable s is  
therefore an estimate of s1t. It follows that s itself can be estimated as sn, where
sn=s
1t
The standard error of this estimate can be shown to be approximately sn>22n.
The prices of actively traded options are not usually calculated from volatilities based 
on historical data. As we shall see later in this chapter, implied volatilities are used by 
traders. However, estimates of volatility based on historical data are used extensively in risk management. Usually risk managers set 
t equal to one day.5 A problem that risk 
managers have to deal with is that volatilities tend to change through time. There are periods of high volatility and periods of low volatility. This affects the amount of data used to estimate volatility (i.e., the choice of n ). If volatilities were constant, the  
accuracy of an estimate would increase as n  increased. However, data that is too old 
may not be relevant to current market conditions. A compromise that seems to work reasonably well is to use 90 to 180 days of data. An alternative rule of thumb is to set n equal to the number of days to which the volatility is to be applied. If the estimate is to be applied over a two-year future period, two years of historical data would then be used. It is natural to look for a way of giving more weight to recent daily price  
movements (i.e., values of 
ui for recent time periods). An approach known as GARCH, 
which will be discussed in Chapter 23 does this.
Example 15.4
Table 15.1 shows a possible sequence of stock prices during 21 consecutive trading 
days. In this case, n=20, so that
an
i=1 ui=0.09531 and ani=1 u2
i=0.00326
and the estimate of the standard deviation of the daily return is
B0.00326
19-0.095312
20*19=0.01216
or 1.216%. Assuming that there are 252 trading days per year, t=1>252 and the 
data give an estimate for the volatility per annum of 0.012161252=0.193, or 
19.3%. The standard error of this estimate is
0.193
22*20=0.031
or 3.1% per annum.
5 Interestingly, estimates of volatility tend to increase as the time period t is made shorter. For example, a 
value of t equal to one hour usually leads to a higher volatility estimate than a value of t equal to one day.4 The mean u is often assumed to be zero when estimates of historical volatilities are made.

The foregoing analysis assumes that the stock pays no dividends, but it can be adapted to 
accommodate dividend-paying stocks. The return, ui, during a time interval that includes 
an ex-dividend day is given by
ui=ln Si+D
Si-1
where D is the amount of the dividend. The return in other time intervals is still
ui=ln Si
Si-1
However, as tax factors play a part in determining returns around an ex-dividend date, it is probably best to discard altogether data for intervals that include an ex-dividend date.
Trading Days vs. Calendar Days
An important issue is whether time should be measured in calendar days or trading days when volatility parameters are being estimated and used. As shown in Business Snapshot 15.2, research shows that volatility is much higher when the exchange is open 
for trading than when it is closed. As a result, practitioners tend to ignore days when the exchange is closed when estimating volatility from historical data and when calculating the life of an option. The volatility per annum is calculated from the volatility per  Table 15.1  Computation of volatility.

This is what we did in Example 15. 4 when calculating volatility from the data in  
Table 15.1. The number of trading days in a year is usually assumed to be 252 for stocks.
The life of an option is also usually measured using trading days rather than calendar 
days. It is calculated as T years, where
T=Number of trading days until option maturity
252Business Snapshot 15.2 What Causes Volatility?
It is natural to assume that the volatility of a stock is caused by new information 
reaching the market. This new information causes people to revise their opinions about the value of the stock. The price of the stock changes and volatility results. This view of what causes volatility is not supported by research. With several years of daily stock price data, researchers can calculate:
1. The variance of stock price returns between the close of trading on one day and the close of trading on the next day when there are no intervening  
nontrading days
2. The variance of the stock price returns between the close of trading on Friday and the close of trading on Monday
The second of these is the variance of returns over a 3-day period. The first is a variance over a 1 -day period. We might reasonably expect the second variance to be three times as great as the first variance. Fama (1965), French (1980), and French and Roll (1986) show that this is not the case. These three research studies estimate the second variance to be, respectively, 22%, 19%, and 10.7% higher than the first variance.
At this stage one might be tempted to argue that these results are explained by more 
news reaching the market when the market is open for trading. But research by Roll (1984) does not support this explanation. Roll looked at the prices of orange juice futures. By far the most important news for orange juice futures prices is news about the weather and this is equally likely to arrive at any time. When Roll did a similar analysis to that just described for stocks, he found that the second (Friday-to-Monday) variance for orange juice futures is only 1.54 times the first variance.
The only reasonable conclusion from all this is that volatility is to a large extent 
caused by trading itself. (Traders usually have no difficulty accepting this conclusion!)
The Black–Scholes–Merton differential equation is an equation that must be satisfied by the price of any derivative dependent on a non-dividend-paying stock. The equation is derived in the next section. Here we consider the nature of the arguments we will use.15.5 THE IDEA UNDERLYING THE BLACK–SCHOLES–MERTON 
DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION
M15_HULL0654_11_GE_C15.indd   346 12/05/2021   17:40The Black–Scholes–Merton Model 347
These are similar to the no-arbitrage arguments we used to value stock options in 
Chapter 13 for the situation where stock price movements were assumed to be binomial. 
They involve setting up a riskless portfolio consisting of a position in the derivative and a position in the stock. In the absence of arbitrage opportunities, the return from the portfolio must be the risk-free interest rate, r . This leads to the Black-Scholes-Merton 
differential equation.
The reason a riskless portfolio can be set up is that the stock price and the derivative 
price are both affected by the same underlying source of uncertainty: stock price  
movements. In any short period of time, the price of the derivative is perfectly  
correlated with the price of the underlying stock. When an appropriate portfolio of the stock and the derivative is established, the gain or loss from the stock position always offsets the gain or loss from the derivative position so that the overall value of the portfolio at the end of the short period of time is known with certainty.
Suppose, for example, that at a particular point in time the relationship between a 
small change 
∆S in the stock price and the resultant small change ∆c in the price of a 
European call option is given by
∆c=0.4 ∆S
This means that the slope of the line representing the relationship between c  and S 
is 0.4, as indicated in Figure 15. 2. A riskless portfolio would consist of:
1. A long position in 40 shares
2. A short position in 100 call options.
Suppose, for example, that the stock price increases by 10 cents. The option price will increase by 4 cents and the 
40*0.1=+4 gain on the shares is equal to the 100*0.04 = 
+4 loss on the short option position.
There is one important difference between the Black–Scholes–Merton analysis and 
our analysis using a binomial model in Chapter 13. In Black–Scholes–Merton, the  
position in the stock and the derivative is riskless for only a very short period of time. (Theoretically, it remains riskless only for an instantaneously short period of time.) To remain riskless, it must be adjusted, or rebalanced, frequently.
6 For example, the  Stock priceSlope 5 0.4Call

S0Figure 15.2 Relationship between call price and stock price. Current stock price is S0.
6 We discuss the rebalancing of portfolios in more detail in Chapter 19.
M15_HULL0654_11_GE_C15.indd   347 12/05/2021   17:40348 CHAPTER 15
relationship between ∆c and ∆S in our example might change from ∆c=0.4 ∆S today 
to ∆c=0.5 ∆S tomorrow. This would mean that, in order to maintain the riskless  
position, an extra 10 shares would have to be purchased for each 100 call options sold. 
It is nevertheless true that the return from the riskless portfolio in any very short period of time must be the risk-free interest rate. This is the key element in the Black–Scholes– Merton analysis and leads to their pricing formulas.
Assumptions
The assumptions we use to derive the Black–Scholes–Merton differential equation are as follows:
1. The stock price follows the process developed in Chapter 14 with 
m and s constant.
2. The short selling of securities with full use of proceeds is permitted.
3. There are no transaction costs or taxes. All securities are perfectly divisible.
4. There are no dividends during the life of the derivative.
5. There are no riskless arbitrage opportunities.
6. Security trading is continuous.
7. The risk-free rate of interest, r, is constant and the same for all maturities.
As we discuss in later chapters, some of these assumptions can be relaxed. For example, 
s and r can be known functions of t. We can even allow interest rates to be stochastic 
provided that the stock price distribution at maturity of the option is still lognormal.
In this section, the notation is different from elsewhere in the book. We consider a 
derivative’s price at a general time t (not at time zero). If T is the maturity date, the time to maturity is 
T-t.
The stock price process we are assuming is the one we developed in Section 14.3:
 dS=mS dt+sS dz (15. 8)
Suppose that f is the price of a call option or other derivative contingent on S. The variable f must be some function of S and t. Hence, from equation (14.14),
 d f=
a0f
0S mS+0f
0t+1
2 02f
0S2 s2S2b dt+0f
0S sS dz (15. 9)
The discrete versions of equations (15.8) and (15.9) are
 ∆S=mS ∆t+sS ∆z (15. 10)
and
 ∆f=a0f
0S mS+0f
0t+1
2 02f
0S2 s2S2b ∆t+0f
0S sS ∆z (15. 11)
where ∆f and ∆S are the changes in f and S in a small time interval ∆t. Recall from  15.6 DERIVATION OF THE BLACK–SCHOLES–MERTON 
DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION
M15_HULL0654_11_GE_C15.indd   348 12/05/2021   17:40The Black–Scholes–Merton Model 349
the discussion of Itô’s lemma in Section 14.6 that the Wiener processes underlying f 
and S are the same. In other words, the ∆z1= P2∆t2 in equations (15.10) and (15.11) 
are the same. It follows that a portfolio of the stock and the derivative can be  
constructed so that the Wiener process is eliminated. The portfolio is
 -1: derivative
 +0f>0S: shares.
The holder of this portfolio is short one derivative and long an amount 0f>0S of  
shares. Define Π as the value of the portfolio. By definition
 Π=-f+0f
0SS (15. 12)
The change ∆Π in the value of the portfolio in the time interval ∆t is given by7
 ∆Π=-∆f+0f
0S∆S (15. 13)
Substituting equations (15.10) and (15.11) into equation (15.13) yields
 ∆Π=a-0f
0t-1
2 02f
0S2s2S2b∆t (15. 14)
Because this equation does not involve ∆z, the portfolio must be riskless during time ∆t. 
The assumptions listed in the preceding section imply that the portfolio must instant-
aneously earn the same rate of return as other short-term risk-free securities. If it earned more than this return, arbitrageurs could make a riskless profit by borrowing money to buy the portfolio; if it earned less, they could make a riskless profit by shorting the  
portfolio and buying risk-free securities. It follows that
 
∆Π=rΠ ∆t (15. 15)
where r is the risk-free interest rate. Substituting from equations (15.12) and (15.14) into 
(15.15), we obtain
a0f
0t+1

0S2s2S2b∆t=raf-0f

so that

Equation (15.16) is the Black–Scholes–Merton differential equation. It has many  
solutions, corresponding to all the different derivatives that can be defined with S  as 
the underlying variable. The particular derivative that is obtained when the equation is  
solved depends on the boundary conditions that are used. These specify the values of the 
derivative at the boundaries of possible values of S and t . In the case of a European call 
option, the key boundary condition is
f=max1S-K, 02 when t=T
7 This derivation of equation (15.16) is not completely rigorous. We need to justify ignoring changes in 0f>0S 
in time ∆t in equation (15.13). A more rigorous derivation involves setting up a self-financing portfolio (i.e., a 
portfolio that requires no infusion or withdrawal of money).
M15_HULL0654_11_GE_C15.indd   349 12/05/2021   17:40350 CHAPTER 15
In the case of a European put option, it is
f=max1K-S, 02 when t=T
Example 15.5
A forward contract on a non-dividend-paying stock is a derivative dependent on 
the stock. As such, it should satisfy equation (15.16). From equation (5.5), we know that the value of the forward contract, f, at a general time t is given in terms of the stock price S at this time by
f=S-Ke-r1T-t2
where K is the delivery price. This means that
0f
0t=-rKe-r1T-t2,  0f
0S=1,  02f
0S2=0
When these are substituted into the left-hand side of equation (15.16), we obtain
-rKe-r1T-t2+rS
This equals r f, showing that equation (15.16) is indeed satisfied.
A Perpetual Derivative
Consider a perpetual derivative that pays off a fixed amount Q when the stock price 
equals H for the first time. In this case, the value of the derivative for a particular S  
has no dependence on t, so the 0f>0t term vanishes and the partial differential 
 equation (15.16) becomes an ordinary differential equation.
Suppose first that S6H. The boundary conditions for the derivative are f=0 when 
S=0 and f=Q when S=H. The simple solution f=QS>H satisfies both the 
boundary conditions and the differential equation. It must therefore be the value of 
the derivative.
Suppose next that S7H. The boundary conditions are now f=0 as S tends to 
infinity and f=Q when S=H. The derivative price
f=QaS
Hb-a
where a is positive, satisfies the boundary conditions. It also satisfies the differential 
equation when
-ra+1
2s2a1a+12-r=0
or a=2r>s2. The value of the derivative is therefore
 f=QaS
Hb-2r>s2
 (15. 17)
Problem 15.21 shows how equation (15.17) can be used to price a perpetual American put option. Section 26.2 extends the analysis to show how perpetual American call and put options can be priced when the underlying asset provides a yield at rate q.

The Prices of Tradeable Derivatives
Any function f1S, t2 that is a solution of the differential equation (15.16) is the  
theoretical price of a derivative that could be traded. If a derivative with that price 
existed, it would not create any arbitrage opportunities. Conversely, if a function f1S, t2 
does not satisfy the differential equation (15.16), it cannot be the price of a derivative without creating arbitrage opportunities for traders.
To illustrate this point, consider first the function 
eS. This does not satisfy the 
differential equation (15.16). It is therefore not a candidate for being the price of a derivative dependent on the stock price. If an instrument whose price was always 
eS 
existed, there would be an arbitrage opportunity. As a second example, consider the function 
e1s2-2r21T-t2>S. This does satisfy the differential equation, and so is, in theory, the 
price of a tradeable security. (It is the price of a derivative that pays off 1>ST at time T .) 
For other examples of tradeable derivatives, see Problems 15.9, 15.10, and 15.21.
We introduced risk-neutral valuation in connection with the binomial model in 
Chapter 13. It is without doubt the single most important tool for the analysis of derivatives. It arises from one key property of the Black–Scholes–Merton differential equation (15.16). This property is that the equation does not involve any variables that are affected by the risk preferences of investors. The variables that do appear in the equation are the current stock price, time, stock price volatility, and the risk-free rate of interest. All are independent of risk preferences.
The Black–Scholes–Merton differential equation would not be independent of risk 
preferences if it involved the expected return, 
m, on the stock. This is because the value 
of m does depend on risk preferences. The higher the level of risk aversion by investors, 
the higher m will be for any given stock. It is fortunate that m happens to drop out in 
the derivation of the differential equation.
Because the Black–Scholes–Merton differential equation is independent of risk 
preferences, an ingenious argument can be used. If risk preferences do not enter the equation, they cannot affect its solution. Any set of risk preferences can, therefore, be used when evaluating f. In particular, the very simple assumption that all investors are risk neutral can be made.
In a world where investors are risk neutral, the expected return on all investment 
assets is the risk-free rate of interest, r. The reason is that risk-neutral investors do not require a premium to induce them to take risks. It is also true that the present value of any cash flow in a risk-neutral world can be obtained by discounting its expected value at the risk-free rate. The assumption that the world is risk neutral does, therefore,  
considerably simplify the analysis of derivatives.
Consider a derivative that provides a payoff at one particular time. It can be valued 
using risk-neutral valuation by using the following procedure:
1. Assume that the expected return from the underlying asset is the risk-free interest rate, r (i.e., assume 
m=r).
2. Calculate the expected payoff from the derivative.
3. Discount the expected payoff at the risk-free interest rate.15.7 RISK-NEUTRAL VALUATION
M15_HULL0654_11_GE_C15.indd   351 12/05/2021   17:40352 CHAPTER 15
It is important to appreciate that risk-neutral valuation (or the assumption that all 
investors are risk neutral) is merely an artificial device for obtaining solutions to the Black–Scholes–Merton differential equation. The solutions that are obtained are valid in all worlds, not just those where investors are risk neutral. When we move from a risk-  
neutral world to a risk-averse world, two things happen. The expected payoff from the derivative changes and the discount rate that must be used for this payoff changes. It happens that these two changes always offset each other exactly.
Application to Forward Contracts on a Stock
We valued forward contracts on a non-dividend-paying stock in Section 5.7. In Example 15.5, we verified that the pricing formula satisfies the Black–Scholes–Merton 
differential equation. In this section we derive the pricing formula from risk-neutral valuation. We make the assumption that interest rates are constant and equal to r. This 
is somewhat more restrictive than the assumption in Chapter 5.
Consider a long forward contract that matures at time T with delivery price, K. As 
indicated in Figure 1.2, the value of the contract at maturity is
ST-K
where ST is the stock price at time T. From the risk-neutral valuation argument, the 
value of the forward contract at time 0 is its expected value at time T in a risk-neutral world discounted at the risk-free rate of interest. Denoting the value of the forward contract at time zero by f, this means that
f=e-rT En1ST-K2
where En denotes the expected value in a risk-neutral world. Since K is a constant, this 
equation becomes
 f=e-rT En1ST2-Ke-rT (15. 18)
The expected return m on the stock becomes r in a risk-neutral world. Hence, from 
equation (15.4), we have 
En1ST2=S0erT (15. 19)
Substituting equation (15.19) into equation (15.18) gives
f=S0-Ke-rT
This is in agreement with equation (5.5).
The most famous solutions to the differential equation (15.16) are the Black–Scholes– 
Merton formulas for the prices of European call and put options. These formulas are:
 c=S0N1d12-Ke-rT N1d22 (15. 20)
and 
p=Ke-rT N1-d22-S0N1-d12 (15. 21)15.8 BLACK–SCHOLES–MERTON PRICING FORMULAS

The function N1x2 is the cumulative probability distribution function for a variable with 
a standard normal distribution. In other words, it is the probability that a variable with 
a standard normal distribution will be less than x. It is illustrated in Figure 15. 3. The 
remaining variables should be familiar. The variables c and p are the European call and  
European put price, S0 is the stock price at time zero, K is the strike price, r is the 
 continuously compounded risk-free rate, s is the stock price volatility, and T is the time 
to maturity of the option.
One way of deriving the Black–Scholes–Merton formulas is by solving the differ -
ential equation (15.16) subject to the boundary condition mentioned in Section 15. 6.8 
(See Problem 15.15 to prove that the call price in equation (15.20) satisfies the  
 differential equation.) Another approach is to use risk-neutral valuation. Consider a 
European call option. The expected value of the option at maturity in a risk-neutral world is
En3max1ST-K, 024
where, as before, En denotes the expected value in a risk-neutral world. From the risk- 
neutral valuation argument, the European call option price c is this expected value 
discounted at the risk-free rate of interest, that is,
 c=e-rT En3max1ST-K, 024 (15. 22)x 0Figure 15.3 Shaded area represents N1x2.
8 The differential equation gives the call and put prices at a general time t. For example, the call price that 
satisfies the differential equation is c=SN1d12-Ke-r1T-t2N1d22, where
d1=ln1S>K2+1r+s2>221T-t2

and d2=d1-s2T-t.

The appendix at the end of this chapter shows that this equation leads to the result in 
equation (15.20).
Since it is never optimal to exercise early an American call option on a non-dividend-  
paying stock (see Section 11.5), equation (15.20) is the value of an American call option on a non-dividend-paying stock. Unfortunately, no exact analytic formula for the value of an American put option on a non-dividend-paying stock has been produced.  
Numerical procedures for calculating American put values are discussed in Chapter 21.
When the Black–Scholes–Merton formula is used in practice the interest rate r is set 
equal to the zero-coupon risk-free interest rate for a maturity T. As we show in later chapters, this is theoretically correct when r is a known function of time. It is also  
theoretically correct when the interest rate is stochastic provided that the stock price at time T is lognormal and the volatility parameter is chosen appropriately. As mentioned 
earlier, time is normally measured as the number of trading days left in the life of the option divided by the number of trading days in 1 year.
Understanding N(d1) and N (d2)
The term N1d22 in equation (15.20) has a fairly simple interpretation. It is the prob-
ability that a call option will be exercised in a risk-neutral world. The N1d12 term is not 
quite so easy to interpret. The expression S0N1d12erT is the expected stock price at 
time T in a risk-neutral world when stock prices less than the strike price are counted as 
zero. The strike price is only paid if the stock price is greater than K  and as just  
mentioned this has a probability of N1d22. The expected payoff in a risk-neutral world is 
therefore
S0N1d12erT-KN1d22
Present-valuing this from time T  to time zero gives the Black–Scholes–Merton equation 
for a European call option:
c=S0N1d12-Ke-rT N1d22
For another way of looking at the Black–Scholes–Merton equation for the value of a European call option, note that it can be written as
c=e-rT N1d223S0erT N1d12>N1d22-K4
The terms here have the following interpretation:
 e-rT: Present value factor
 N1d22: Probability of exercise
 S0erT N1d12>N1d22: Expected stock price in a risk-neutral world if option is exercised
 K: Strike price paid if option is exercised.
Properties of the Black–Scholes–Merton Formulas
We now show that the Black–Scholes–Merton formulas have the right general proper -
ties by considering what happens when some of the parameters take extreme values.
When the stock price, S0, becomes very large, a call option is almost certain to be 
exercised. It then becomes very similar to a forward contract with delivery price K.
M15_HULL0654_11_GE_C15.indd   354 12/05/2021   17:40The Black–Scholes–Merton Model 355
From equation (5.5), we expect the call price to be
S0-Ke-rT
This is, in fact, the call price given by equation (15.20) because, when S0 becomes very 
large, both d1 and d2 become very large, and N1d12 and N1d22 become close to 1.0. 
When the stock price becomes very large, the price of a European put option, p , 
approaches zero. This is consistent with equation (15.21) because N1-d12 and N1-d22 
are both close to zero in this case.
Consider next what happens when the volatility s approaches zero. Because the stock 
is virtually riskless, its price will grow at rate r  to S0erT at time T  and the payoff from a 
call option is
max1S0erT-K, 02
Discounting at rate r, the value of the call today is
e-rT max1S0erT-K, 02=max1S0-Ke-rT, 02
To show that this is consistent with equation (15.20), consider first the case where 
S07Ke-rT. This implies that ln 1S0>K2+rT70. As s tends to zero, d1 and d2 tend to 
+ q, so that N1d12 and N1d22 tend to 1.0 and equation (15.20) becomes
c=S0-Ke-rT
When S06Ke-rT, it follows that ln1S0>K2+rT60. As s tends to zero, d1 and d2  
tend to - q, so that N1d12 and N1d22 tend to zero and equation (15.20) gives a call  
price of zero. The call price is therefore always max 1S0-Ke-rT, 02 as s tends to zero. 
Similarly, it can be shown that the put price is always max1Ke-rT-S0, 02 as s tends  
to zero.
When implementing equations (15.20) and (15.21), it is necessary to evaluate the 
cumulative normal distribution function N1x2. Tables for N1x2 are provided at the 
end of this book. The NORMSDIST function in Excel also provides a convenient  
way of calculating N1x2.
Example 15.6
The stock price 6 months from the expiration of an option is $42, the exercise price of the option is $40, the risk-free interest rate is 10% per annum, and the volatility is 20% per annum. This means that 
S0=42, K=40, r=0.1, s=0.2, T=0.5,
 d1=ln142>402+10.1+0.22>22*0.5
0.220.5=0.7693
 d2=ln142>402+10.1-0.22>22*0.5
0.220.5=0.6278
and
Ke-rT=40e-0.05=38.04915.9 CUMULATIVE NORMAL DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION
M15_HULL0654_11_GE_C15.indd   355 12/05/2021   17:40356 CHAPTER 15
Hence, if the option is a European call, its value c is given by
c=42N10.76932-38.049N10.62782
If the option is a European put, its value p is given by
p=38.049N1-0.62782-42N1-0.76932
Using the NORMSDIST function in Excel gives
 N10.76932=0.7791,  N1-0.76932=0.2209
 N10.62782=0.7349,  N1-0.62782=0.2651
so that
c=4.76,  p=0.81
Ignoring the time value of money, the stock price has to rise by $2.76 for the 
purchaser of the call to break even. Similarly, the stock price has to fall by $2.81 for the purchaser of the put to break even.
The exercise of a regular call option on a company has no effect on the number of the company’s shares outstanding. If the writer of the option does not own the company’s shares, he or she must buy them in the market in the usual way and then sell them to the option holder for the strike price. As explained in Chapter 10, warrants and employee stock options are different from regular call options in that exercise leads to the  
company issuing more shares and then selling them to the option holder for the strike price. As the strike price is less than the market price, this dilutes the interest of the existing shareholders.
How should potential dilution affect the way we value outstanding warrants and 
employee stock options? The answer is that it should not! Assuming markets are  
efficient the stock price will reflect potential dilution from all outstanding warrants  
and employee stock options. This is explained in Business Snapshot 15. 3.
9
Consider next the situation a company is in when it is contemplating a new issue of 
warrants (or employee stock options). We suppose that the company is interested in calculating the cost of the issue assuming that there are no compensating benefits. We assume that the company has N shares worth 
S0 each and the number of new options 
contemplated is M, with each option giving the holder the right to buy one share for K. The value of the company today is 
NS0. This value does not change as a result of the 
warrant issue. Suppose that without the warrant issue the share price will be ST at the 
warrant’s maturity. This means that (with or without the warrant issue) the total value of the equity and the warrants at time T  will 
NST. If the warrants are exercised, there is a 
cash inflow from the strike price increasing this to NST+MK. This value is distributed 15.10   WARRANTS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS
9 Analysts sometimes assume that the sum of the values of the warrants and the equity (rather than just the 
value of the equity) is lognormal. The result is a Black–Scholes type of equation for the value of the warrant in 
terms of the value of the warrant. See Technical Note 3 at www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull/TechnicalNotes for an explanation of this model.
M15_HULL0654_11_GE_C15.indd   356 12/05/2021   17:40The Black–Scholes–Merton Model 357
among N+M shares, so that the share price immediately after exercise becomes
NST+MK
N+M
Therefore the payoff to an option holder if the option is exercised is
NST+MK
N+M-K
or
N
N+M 1ST-K2
This shows that the value of each option is the value of
N
N+M
regular call options on the company’s stock. Therefore the total cost of the options is 
M times this. Since we are assuming that there are no benefits to the company from the warrant issue, the total value of the company’s equity will decline by the total cost of the options as soon as the decision to issue the warrants becomes generally known. This means that the reduction in the stock price is
M
N+M
times the value of a regular call option with strike price K and maturity T.Business Snapshot 15.3 Warrants, Employee Stock Options, and Dilution
Consider a company with 100,000 shares each worth $50. It surprises the market with an announcement that it is granting 100,000 stock options to its employees with a strike price of $50. If the market sees little benefit to the shareholders from the employee stock options in the form of reduced salaries and more highly motivated managers, the stock price will decline immediately after the announcement of the employee stock options. If the stock price declines to $45, the dilution cost to the current shareholders is $5 per share or $500,000 in total.
Suppose that the company does well so that by the end of three years the share 
price is $100. Suppose further that all the options are exercised at this point. The payoff to the employees is $50 per option. It is tempting to argue that there will be further dilution in that 100,000 shares worth $100 per share are now merged with 100,000 shares for which only $50 is paid, so that (a) the share price reduces to $75 and (b) the payoff to the option holders is only $25 per option. However, this  
argument is flawed. The exercise of the options is anticipated by the market and already reflected in the share price. The payoff from each option exercised is $50.
This example illustrates the general point that when markets are efficient the 
impact of dilution from executive stock options or warrants is reflected in the stock price as soon as they are announced and does not need to be taken into account again when the options are valued.
M15_HULL0654_11_GE_C15.indd   357 12/05/2021   17:40358 CHAPTER 15
Example 15.7
A company with 1 million shares worth $40 each is considering issuing 200,000 
warrants each giving the holder the right to buy one share with a strike price of $60 in 5 years. It wants to know the cost of this. The interest rate is 3% per annum, and the volatility is 30% per annum. The company pays no dividends. From equation (15.20), the value of a 5-year European call option on the stock is $7.04. In this case, 
N=1,000,000 and M=200,000, so that the value of each 
warrant is
1,000,000
1,000,000+200,000*7.04=5.87
or $5.87. The total cost of the warrant issue is 200,000*5.87=+1.17 million. 
Assuming the market perceives no benefits from the warrant issue, we expect the stock price to decline by $1.17 to $38.83.
10 Implied volatilities for European and American options can be calculated using DerivaGem.
11 This method is presented for illustration. Other more powerful methods, such as the Newton–Raphson 
method, are often used in practice (see footnote 3 of Chapter 4).The one parameter in the Black–Scholes–Merton pricing formulas that cannot be directly observed is the volatility of the stock price. In Section 15. 4, we discussed  
how this can be estimated from a history of the stock price. In practice, traders usually work with what are known as implied volatilities. These are the volatilities implied by option prices observed in the market.
10
To illustrate how implied volatilities are calculated, suppose that the market price of a 
European call option on a non-dividend-paying stock is 1.875 when S0=21, K=20, 
r=0.1, and T=0.25. The implied volatility is the value of s that, when substituted 
into equation (15.20), gives c=1.875. Unfortunately, it is not possible to invert equa-
tion (15.20) so that s is expressed as a function of S0, K, r, T, and c . However, an  
iterative search procedure can be used to find the implied s. For example, we can start 
by trying s=0.20. This gives a value of c  equal to 1.76, which is too low. Because c  is 
an increasing function of s, a higher value of s is required. We can next try a value of 
0.30 for s. This gives a value of c  equal to 2.10, which is too high and means that s  
must lie between 0.20 and 0.30. Next, a value of 0.25 can be tried for s. This also proves 
to be too high, showing that s lies between 0.20 and 0.25. Proceeding in this way, we 
can halve the range for s at each iteration and the correct value of s can be calculated 
to any required accuracy.11 In this example, the implied volatility is 0.235, or 23.5%, per 
annum. A similar procedure can be used in conjunction with binomial trees to find implied volatilities for American options.
Implied volatilities are used to monitor the market’s opinion about the volatility of a 
particular stock. Whereas historical volatilities (see Section 15. 4) are backward looking, 
implied volatilities are forward looking. Traders often quote the implied volatility of an option rather than its price. This is convenient because the implied volatility tends to be less variable than the option price. The implied volatilities of actively traded options on an asset are often used by traders to estimate appropriate implied volatilities for other options on the asset.15.11   IMPLIED VOLATILITIES

The VIX Index
The CBOE publishes indices of implied volatility. The most popular index, the SPX 
VIX, is an index of the implied volatility of 30-day options on the S&P 500 calculated from a wide range of calls and puts. It is sometimes referred to as the “fear factor. ” An index value of 15 indicates that the implied volatility of 30-day options on the S&P 500 is estimated as 15%. Information on the way the index is calculated is in Section 26.16. Trading in futures on the VIX started in 2004 and trading in options on the VIX started in 2006. One contract is on 1,000 times the index.
Example 15.8
Suppose that a trader buys an April futures contract on the VIX when the futures 
price is 18.5 (corresponding to a 30-day S&P 500 volatility of 18.5%) and closes out the contract when the futures price is 19.3 (corresponding to an S&P 500  
volatility of 19.3%). The trader makes a gain of $800.
A trade involving options on the S&P 500 is a bet on the future level of the S&P 500, which depends on the volatility of the S&P 500. By contrast, a futures or options contract on the VIX is a bet only on volatility. Figure 15. 4 shows the VIX index between January 
2004 and June 2020. Between 2004 and mid-2007 it tended to stay between 10 and 20. It reached 30 during the second half of 2007 and a record 80 in October and November 2008 after Lehman’s bankruptcy. By early 2010, it had declined to more normal levels. It has spiked several times since 2010 because of stresses and uncertainties in financial markets. In 2020, there was another big increase because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
VIX monitors the volatility of the S&P 500. The CBOE publishes a range of other 
volatility indices. These are on other stock indices, commodity indices, interest rates, currencies, and some individual stocks (for example, Amazon and Goldman Sachs). There is even a volatility index of the VIX index (VVIX).

12 For tax reasons the stock price may go down by somewhat less than the cash amount of the dividend. To 
take account of this phenomenon, we need to interpret the word ‘dividend’ in the context of option pricing as 
the reduction in the stock price on the ex-dividend date caused by the dividend. Thus, if a dividend of $1 per share is anticipated and the share price normally goes down by 80% of the dividend on the ex-dividend date, the dividend should be assumed to be $0.80 for the purpose of the analysis.
13 This is not quite the same as the volatility of the whole stock price. (In theory, they cannot both follow 
geometric Brownian motion.) At time zero, the volatility of the risky component is approximately equal to the volatility of the whole stock price multiplied by 
S0>1S0-D2, where D is the present value of the  
dividends.Up to now, we have assumed that the stock on which the option is written pays no 
dividends. In this section, we modify the Black–Scholes–Merton model to take account of dividends. We assume that the amount and timing of the dividends during the life of an option can be predicted with certainty. When options last for relatively short periods of time, this assumption is not too unreasonable. (For long-life options it is usual to assume that the dividend yield rather the dollar dividend payments are known. Options can then be valued as will be described in the Chapter 17.) The date on which the  
dividend is paid should be assumed to be the ex-dividend date. On this date the stock price declines by the amount of the dividend.
12
European Options
European options can be analyzed by assuming that the stock price is the sum of two components: a riskless component that corresponds to the known dividends during the life of the option and a risky component. The riskless component, at any given time, is the present value of all the dividends during the life of the option discounted from the ex-dividend dates to the present at the risk-free rate. By the time the option matures, the dividends will have been paid and the riskless component will no longer exist. The Black–Scholes–Merton formula is therefore correct if 
S0 is equal to the  
risky component of the stock price and s  is the volatility of the process followed by 
the risky component.13
Operationally, this means that the Black–Scholes–Merton formulas can be used 
provided that the stock price is reduced by the present value of all the dividends during the life of the option, the discounting being done from the ex-dividend dates at the risk-  
free rate. As already mentioned, a dividend is counted as being during the life of the option only if its ex-dividend date occurs during the life of the option.
Example 15.9
Consider a European call option on a stock when there are ex-dividend dates in 
two months and five months. The dividend on each ex-dividend date is expected to be $0.50. The current share price is $40, the exercise price is $40, the stock price volatility is 30% per annum, the risk-free rate of interest is 9% per annum, and the time to maturity is six months. The present value of the dividends is
0.5e-0.09*2>12+0.5e-0.09*5>12=0.9742
The option price can therefore be calculated from the Black–Scholes–Merton 15.12   DIVIDENDS

formula, with S0=40-0.9742=39.0258,  K=40, r=0.09, s=0.3, and 
T=0.5:
 d1=ln139.0258>402+10.09+0.32>22*0.5
0.320.5=0.2020
 d2=ln139.0258>402+10.09-0.32>22*0.5
0.320.5=-0.0102
Using the NORMSDIST function in Excel gives
N1d12=0.5800, N1d22=0.4959
and, from equation (15.20), the call price is
39.0258*0.5800-40e-0.09*0.5*0.4959=3.67
or $3.67.
Some researchers have criticized the approach just described for calculating the value 
of a European option on a dividend-paying stock. They argue that volatility should be 
applied to the stock price, not to the stock price less the present value of dividends.  
A number of different numerical procedures have been suggested for doing this.14 When 
volatility is calculated from historical data, it might make sense to use one of these procedures. However, in practice the volatility used to price an option is nearly always implied from the prices of other options using procedures we will outline in Chapter 20. If an analyst uses the same model for both implying and applying volatilities, the  
resulting prices should be accurate and not highly model dependent. Another important point is that in practice, as will be explained in Chapter 18, practitioners usually value a European option in terms of the forward price of the underlying asset. This avoids the need to estimate explicitly the income that is expected from the asset. The volatility of the forward stock price is the same as the volatility of a variable equal to the stock price minus the present value of dividends.
The model we have proposed where the stock price is divided into two components is 
internally consistent and widely used in practice. We will use the same model when valuing American options in Chapter 21.
American Call Options
Consider next American call options. Chapter 11 showed that in the absence of  
dividends American options should never be exercised early. An extension to the argument shows that, when there are dividends, it can only be optimal to exercise at a time immediately before the stock goes ex-dividend. We assume that n  ex-dividend 
dates are anticipated and that they are at times 
t1, t2,c, tn, with t16t26c6tn.  
The dividends corresponding to these times will be denoted by D1, D 2,c, D n, 
respectively.
We start by considering the possibility of early exercise just prior to the final  
ex-dividend date (i.e., at time tn). If the option is exercised at time tn, the investor 
receives
S1tn2-K
14 See, for example, N. Areal and A. Rodrigues, “Fast Trees for Options with Discrete Dividends, ” Journal  
of Derivatives, 21, 1 (Fall 2013), 49–63.
M15_HULL0654_11_GE_C15.indd   361 12/05/2021   17:40362 CHAPTER 15
where S1t2 denotes the stock price at time t. If the option is not exercised, the stock 
price drops to S1tn2-Dn. As shown by equation (11.4), the value of the option is then 
greater than
S1tn2-Dn-Ke-r1T-tn2
It follows that, if
S1tn2-Dn-Ke-r1T-tn2ÚS1tn2-K
that is,
 Dn…K31-e-r1T-tn24 (15. 23)
it cannot be optimal to exercise at time tn. On the other hand, if
 Dn7K31-e-r1T-tn24 (15. 24)
for any reasonable assumption about the stochastic process followed by the stock price, 
it can be shown that it is always optimal to exercise at time tn for a sufficiently high 
value of S1tn2. The inequality in (15.24) will tend to be satisfied when the final ex-  
dividend date is fairly close to the maturity of the option (i.e., T-tn is small) and the 
dividend is large.
Consider next time tn-1, the penultimate ex-dividend date. If the option is exercised 
immediately prior to time tn-1, the investor receives S1tn-12-K. If the option is not 
exercised at time tn-1, the stock price drops to S1tn-12-Dn-1 and the earliest  
subsequent time at which exercise could take place is tn. Hence, from equation (11.4), 
a lower bound to the option price if it is not exercised at time tn-1 is
S1tn-12-Dn-1-Ke-r1tn-tn-12
It follows that if
S1tn-12-Dn-1-Ke-r1tn-tn-12ÚS1tn-12-K
or
Dn-1…K31-e-r1tn-tn-124
it is not optimal to exercise immediately prior to time tn-1. Similarly, for any i6n, if
 Di…K31-e-r1ti+1-ti24 (15. 25)
it is not optimal to exercise immediately prior to time ti.
The inequality in (15.25) is approximately equivalent to
Di…Kr1ti+1-ti2
Assuming that K  is fairly close to the current stock price, this inequality is satisfied 
when the dividend yield on the stock is less than the risk-free rate of interest. This is often not true in low interest environments.
We can conclude from this analysis that, in many circumstances, the most likely  
time for the early exercise of an American call is immediately before the final ex- dividend date, 
tn. Furthermore, if inequality (15.25) holds for i=1, 2,c, n-1 and 
inequality (15.23) holds, we can be certain that early exercise is never optimal, and the American option can be treated as a European option.

Black’s Approximation
Black suggests an approximate procedure for taking account of early exercise in call 
options.15 This involves calculating, as described earlier in this section, the prices of 
European options that mature at times T  and tn, and then setting the American price equal 
to the greater of the two.16 This is an approximation because it in effect assumes the option 
holder has to decide at time zero whether the option will be exercised at time T  or tn.
SUMMARY
We started this chapter by examining the properties of the process for stock prices introduced in Chapter 14. The process implies that the price of a stock at some future time, given its price today, is lognormal. It also implies that the continuously com-pounded return from the stock in a period of time is normally distributed. Our  
uncertainty about future stock prices increases as we look further ahead. The standard deviation of the logarithm of the stock price is proportional to the square root of how far ahead we are looking.
To estimate the volatility 
s of a stock price empirically, the stock price is observed at 
fixed intervals of time (e.g., every day, every week, or every month). For each time period, the natural logarithm of the ratio of the stock price at the end of the time period to the stock price at the beginning of the time period is calculated. The volatility is  
estimated as the standard deviation of these numbers divided by the square root of the length of the time period in years. Usually, days when the exchanges are closed are ignored in measuring time for the purposes of volatility calculations.
The differential equation for the price of any derivative dependent on a stock can be 
obtained by creating a riskless portfolio of the derivative and the stock. Because the derivative’s price and the stock price both depend on the same underlying source of uncertainty, this can always be done. The portfolio that is created remains riskless for only a very short period of time. However, the return on a riskless porfolio must always be the risk-free interest rate if there are to be no arbitrage opportunities.
The expected return on the stock does not enter into the Black–Scholes–Merton 
differential equation. This leads to an extremely useful result known as risk-neutral valuation. This result states that when valuing a derivative dependent on a stock price, we can assume that the world is risk neutral. This means that we can assume that the expected return from the stock is the risk-free interest rate, and then discount expected payoffs at the risk-free interest rate. The Black–Scholes–Merton equations for Eur -
opean call and put options can be derived by either solving their differential equation or by using risk-neutral valuation.
An implied volatility is the volatility that, when used in conjunction with the Black– 
Scholes–Merton option pricing formula, gives the market price of the option. Traders

involves the cumulative bivariate normal distribution function. A procedure for calculating this function is given in Technical Note 5 and a worksheet for calculating the cumulative bivariate normal distribution can be found on the author’s website.

monitor implied volatilities. They often quote the implied volatility of an option rather 
than its price. They have developed procedures for using the volatilities implied by the prices of actively traded options to estimate volatilities for other options on the same asset.
The Black–Scholes–Merton results can be extended to cover European call and put 
options on dividend-paying stocks. The procedure is to use the Black–Scholes–Merton formula with the stock price reduced by the present value of the dividends anticipated during the life of the option, and the volatility equal to the volatility of the stock price net of the present value of these dividends.
It can be optimal to exercise American call options immediately before any ex-  
dividend date, but in practice early exercise is most likely on the final ex-dividend date. Fischer Black has suggested an approximation. This involves setting the American call option price equal to the greater of two European call option prices. The first European call option expires at the same time as the American call option; the second expires immediately prior to the final ex-dividend date.

APPENDIX 
PROOF OF THE BLACK–SCHOLES–MERTON FORMULA USING 
RISK-NEUTRAL VALUATION
We will prove the Black–Scholes result by first proving another key result that will also 
be useful in future chapters.
Key Result
If V is lognormally distributed and the standard deviation of ln V is w, then
 E3max1V-K, 024=E1V2N1d12-KN1d22 (15A.1)
where
 d1=ln3E1V2>K4+w2>2
w
 d2=ln3E1V2>K4-w2>2
w
and E denotes the expected value. (See Problem 15.27 for a similar result for puts.)
Proof of Key Result
Define g(V) as the probability density function of V. It follows that
 E3max1V-K, 024=
L∞
K1V-K2g1V2 dV (15A.2)
The variable ln V is normally distributed with standard deviation w. From the proper -
ties of the lognormal distribution, the mean of ln V is m, where17
 m=ln3E1V24-w2>2 (15A.3)
Define a new variable
 Q=ln V-m
w (15A.4)
This variable is normally distributed with a mean of zero and a standard deviation  
of 1.0. Denote the density function for Q by h1Q2 so that
h1Q2=1
22p e-Q2>2
Using equation (15A.4) to convert the expression on the right-hand side of equa-
tion (15A.2) from an integral over V to an integral over Q, we get
E3max1V-K, 024=
L∞
1ln K-m2>w1eQw+m-K2h1Q2dQ
or
 E3max1V-K, 024=
L∞
1ln K-m2>weQw+mh1Q2dQ-K 
L∞
1ln K-m2>w h1Q2dQ (15A.5)

M15_HULL0654_11_GE_C15.indd   369 12/05/2021   17:40370 CHAPTER 15
Now
 eQw+mh1Q2=1
22p e1-Q2+2Qw+2m2>2=1
22p e3-1Q-w22+2m+w24>2
 =em+w2>2
22p e3-1Q-w224>2=em+w2>2h1Q-w2
This means that equation (15A.5) becomes
E3max1V-K, 024=em+w2>2 
L∞
1ln K-m2>w h1Q-w2dQ-K 
L∞
1ln K-m2>w h1Q2dQ (15A.6)
If we define N1x2 as the probability that a variable with a mean of zero and a standard 
deviation of 1.0 is less than x, the first integral in equation (15A.6) is
1-N31ln K-m2>w-w4=N31-ln K+m2>w+w4
Substituting for m from equation (15A.3) leads to
Naln3E1V2>K4+w2>2
wb=N1d12
Similarly the second integral in equation (15A.6) is N1d22. Equation (15A.6), therefore, 
becomes
E3max1V-K, 024=em+w2>2N1d12-KN1d22
Substituting for m from equation (15A.3) gives the key result.
The Black–Scholes–Merton Result
We now consider a call option on a non-dividend-paying stock maturing at time T. The 
strike price is K , the risk-free rate is r , the current stock price is S0, and the volatility 
is s. As shown in equation (15.22), the call price c is given by
 c=e-rT En3max1ST-K, 024 (15A.7)
where ST is the stock price at time T and En denotes the expectation in a risk-neutral 
world. Under the stochastic process assumed by Black–Scholes–Merton, ST is log- 
normal. Also, from equations (15.3) and (15.4), En1ST2=S0erT and the standard  
deviation of ln ST is s2T.
From the key result just proved, equation (15A.7) implies
c=e-rT3S0erT N1d12-KN1d224=S0N1d12-Ke-rT N1d22
where
 d1=ln3En1ST2>K4+s2T>2
s2T=ln1S0>K2+1r+s2>22T
s2T
 d2=ln3En1ST2>K4-s2T>2
s2T=ln1S0>K2+1r-s2>22T
s2T
This is the Black–Scholes–Merton result.

Employee 
Stock Options16 CHAPTER  
Employee stock options are call options on a company’s stock granted by the  company 
to its employees. The options give the employees a stake in the fortunes of the 
 company. If the company does well so that the company’s stock price moves above 
the strike price, employees gain by exercising the options and then selling the stock they acquire at the market price.
Many companies, particularly technology companies, feel that the only way they can 
attract and keep the best employees is to offer them attractive stock option packages.  
Some companies grant options only to senior management; others grant them to people  
at all levels in the organization. Microsoft was one of the first companies to use employee stock options. All Microsoft employees were granted options and, as the company’s stock price rose, it is estimated that over 10,000 of them became millionaires. Employee stock options have become less popular in recent years for reasons we will explain in this chapter. (Microsoft, for example, announced in 2003 that it would discontinue the use of  
options and award shares of Microsoft to employees instead.) But many companies throughout the world continue to be enthusiastic users of employee stock options.
Employee stock options are popular with start-up companies. Often these companies 
do not have the resources to pay key employees as much as they could earn with an established company and they solve this problem by supplementing the salaries of the  
employees with stock options. If the company does well and shares are sold to the  public in an initial public offering (IPO), the options are likely to prove to be very 
valuable. Some newly formed companies have even granted options to students who worked for just a few months during their summer break—and in some cases this has led to windfalls of hundreds of thousands of dollars for the students.
This chapter explains how stock option plans work and how their popularity has been 
influenced by their accounting treatment. It discusses whether employee stock options help to align the interests of shareholders with those of top executives running a com-pany. It also describes how these options are valued and looks at backdating scandals.
16.1 CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS
Employee stock options often last as long as 10 to 15 years. Very often the strike price is set equal to the stock price on the grant date so that the option is initially at the money.
M16_HULL0654_11_GE_C16.indd   371 30/04/2021   17:32372 CHAPTER 16
The following are common features of employee stock option plans:
1. There is a vesting period during which the options cannot be exercised. This 
 vesting period can be as long as four years.
2. When employees leave their jobs (voluntarily or involuntarily) during the vesting 
period, they forfeit their options.
3. When employees leave (voluntarily or involuntarily) after the vesting period, they forfeit options that are out of the money and they have to exercise vested options that are in the money almost immediately.
4. Employees are not permitted to sell the options.
5. When an employee exercises options, the company issues new shares and sells 
them to the employee for the strike price.
The Early Exercise Decision
The fourth feature of employee stock option plans noted above has important implica-tions. If employees, for whatever reason, want to realize a cash benefit from options that have vested, they must exercise the options and sell the underlying shares. They cannot sell the options to someone else. This leads to a tendency for employee stock options to be exercised earlier than similar exchange-traded or over-the-counter call options.
Consider a call option on a stock paying no dividends. In Section 11.5 we showed that, 
if it is a regular call option, it should never be exercised early. The holder of the option will always do better by selling the option rather than exercising it before the end of its life. However, the arguments we used in Section 11.5 are not applicable to employee stock options because they cannot be sold. The only way employees can realize a cash benefit from the options (or diversify their holdings) is by exercising the options and selling the stock. It is therefore not unusual for an employee stock option to be exercised well before it would be optimal to exercise the option if it were a regular exchange-traded or over-the-counter option.
Should an employee ever exercise his or her options before maturity and then keep  
the stock rather than selling it? Assume that the option’s strike price is constant during the life of the option and the option can be exercised at any time. To answer the  question we consider two options: the employee stock option and an otherwise identical 
regular option that can be sold in the market. We refer to the first option as option A  
and the second as option B. If the stock pays no dividends, we know that option B should never be exercised early. It follows that it is not optimal to exercise option A and keep the stock. If the employee wants to maintain a stake in his or her company, a better strategy is to keep the option. This delays paying the strike price and maintains the insurance value of the option, as described in Section 11.5. Only when it is optimal  
to exercise option B can it be a rational strategy for an employee to exercise option A before maturity and keep the stock.
1 As discussed in Section 15.12, it is optimal to 
exercise option B only when a relatively high dividend is imminent.
In practice the early exercise behavior of employees varies widely from company to  
company. In some companies, there is a culture of not exercising early; in others, employees tend to exercise options and sell the stock soon after the end of the vesting period, even if the options are only slightly in the money.
1 The only exception to this could be when an executive wants to own the stock for its voting rights.
M16_HULL0654_11_GE_C16.indd   372 30/04/2021   17:32Employee Stock Options 373
For investors to have confidence in capital markets, it is important that the interests of 
shareholders and managers are reasonably well aligned. This means that managers should be motivated to make decisions that are in the best interests of shareholders. Managers are the agents of the shareholders and, as mentioned in Chapter 8, economists use the term agency costs to describe the losses experienced when the interests of agents 
and principals are not aligned.
Do employee stock options help align the interests of employees and shareholders? 
The answer to this question is not straightforward. There can be little doubt that they serve a useful purpose for a start-up company. The options are an excellent way for the main shareholders, who are usually also senior executives, to motivate employees to work long hours. If the company is successful and there is an IPO, the employees will do very well; but if the company is unsuccessful, the options will be worthless.
It is the options granted to the senior executives of publicly traded companies that  
are most controversial. Executive stock options are sometimes referred to as an  executive’s “pay for performance.” If the company’s stock price goes up, so that 
 shareholders make gains, the executive is rewarded. However, this overlooks the 
 asymmetric payoffs of options. If the company does badly then the shareholders lose 
money, but all that happens to the executives is that they fail to make a gain. Unlike the  
shareholders, they do not experience a loss.
2 Many people think that a better type of 
pay for performance is a restricted stock unit. This entitles the executive to own a share of the company’s stock at a particular future time (the vesting date). The gains and losses of the executives then mirror those of other shareholders. It is sometimes argued that the asymmetric payoffs of options can lead to senior executives taking risks they would not otherwise take. This may or may not be in the interests of the company’s shareholders.
What temptations do stock options create for a senior executive? Suppose an 
 executive plans to exercise a large number of stock options in three months and sell 
the stock. He or she might be tempted to time announcements of good news—or even move earnings from one quarter to another—so that the stock price increases just before the options are exercised. Alternatively, if at-the-money options are due to be  
granted to the executive in three months, the executive might be tempted to take actions that reduce the stock price just before the grant date. The type of behavior we are talking about here is of course totally unacceptable—and may well be illegal. But the backdating scandals, which are discussed later in this chapter, show that the way some executives have handled issues related to stock options leaves much to be desired.
Even when there is no impropriety of the type we have just mentioned, executive 
stock options are liable to have the effect of motivating executives to focus on short-term profits at the expense of longer-term performance. Managers of large funds worry that, because stock options are such a huge component of an executive’s compensation, they are liable to be a big source of distraction. Senior management may spend too 16.2 DO OPTIONS ALIGN THE INTERESTS OF SHAREHOLDERS 
AND MANAGERS?
2 When options have moved out of the money, companies have sometimes replaced them with new at-the-
money options. This practice known as “repricing” leads to the executive’s gains and losses being even less 
closely tied to those of the shareholders.
M16_HULL0654_11_GE_C16.indd   373 30/04/2021   17:32374 CHAPTER 16
much time thinking about all the different aspects of their compensation and not 
enough time running the company.
A manager’s inside knowledge and ability to affect outcomes and announcements is 
always liable to interact with his or her trading in a way that is to the disadvantage of other shareholders. One radical suggestion for mitigating this problem is to require executives to give notice to the market—perhaps one week’s notice—of an intention to buy or sell their company’s stock.
3 (Once the notice of an intention to trade had been 
given, it would be binding on the executive.) This allows the market to form its own conclusions about why the executive is trading. As a result, the price may increase before the executive buys and decrease before the executive sells.
3 This would apply to the exercise of options because, if an executive wants to exercise options and sell the 
stock that is acquired, then he or she would have to give notice of intention to sell.
4 See J. C. Hull and A. White, “Accounting for Employee Stock Options: A Practical Approach to Handling 
the Valuation Issues,” Journal of Derivatives Accounting, 1, 1 (2004): 3–9.16.3 ACCOUNTING ISSUES
An employee stock option represents a cost to the company and a benefit to the employee just like any other form of compensation. This point, which for many is self-evident, is actually quite controversial. Many corporate executives appear to believe that an option has no value unless it is in the money. As a result, they argue that an at-the-money option issued by the company is not a cost to the company. The reality is that, if options are valuable to employees, they must represent a cost to the company’s shareholders—and therefore to the company. There is no free lunch. The cost to the company of the options arises from the fact that the company has agreed that, if its stock does well, it will sell shares to employees at a price less than that which would apply in the open market.
Prior to 1995, the cost charged to the income statement of a company when it issued 
stock options was the intrinsic value. Most options were at the money when they were first issued, so that this cost was zero. In 1995, accounting standard FAS 123 was issued. Many people expected it to require the expensing of options at their fair value. However, as a result of intense lobbying, the 1995 version of FAS 123 only encouraged  
companies to expense the fair value of the options they granted on the income  statement. It did not require them to do so. If fair value was not expensed on the 
income statement, it had to be reported in a footnote to the company’s accounts.
Accounting standards have now changed to require the expensing of all stock-based 
compensation at its fair value on the income statement. In February 2004, the Inter-national Accounting Standards Board issued IAS 2 requiring companies to start expensing stock options in 2005. In December 2004, FAS 123 was revised to require the expensing of employee stock options in the United States starting in 2005.
The effect of the new accounting standards is to require options to be valued on the 
grant date and the amount to be recorded as an expense in the income statement for the year in which the grant is made. Valuation at a time later than the grant date is not required. It can be argued that options should be revalued at financial year ends (or every quarter) until they are exercised or reach the end of their lives.
4 This would treat 
them in the same way as other derivative transactions entered into by the company. If the option became more valuable from one year to the next, there would then be an 
M16_HULL0654_11_GE_C16.indd   374 30/04/2021   17:32Employee Stock Options 375
additional amount to be expensed. However, if it declined in value, there would be a 
positive impact on income.
This approach would have a number of advantages. The cumulative charge to the 
company would reflect the actual cost of the options (either zero if the options are not exercised or the option payoff if they are exercised). Although the charge in any year would depend on the option pricing model used, the cumulative charge over the life of the option would not.
5 Arguably there would be much less incentive for the company to  
engage in the backdating practices described later in the chapter. The disadvantage usually cited for accounting in this way is that it is undesirable because it introduces volatility into the income statement.

Alternatives to Stock Options
The accounting rules which came into effect in 2005 have led companies to consider alternatives to traditional compensation plans where at-the-money stock options are granted. We have already mentioned restricted stock units (RSUs), which are shares that will be owned by the employee at a future time (the vesting date). Many companies have replaced stock options by RSUs. A variation on an RSU is a market-leveraged stock unit (MSU), in which the number of shares that will be owned on the vesting date is equal to 
ST>S0, where S0 is the stock price on the grant date and ST is the stock price 
on the vesting date.7
If the stock market as a whole goes up, employees with stock options tend to do well, 
even if their own company’s stock price underperforms the market. One way of over- coming this problem is to tie the strike price of the options to the performance of a broadly based index. Suppose that on the option grant date the stock price is $30 and the index is 2,000. The strike price would initially be set at $30. If the index increased by 10% to 2,200, then the strike price would also increase by 10% to $33. If the index moved down by 15% to 1,700, then the strike price would also move down by 15% to $25.50. The effect of this is that the company’s stock price performance has to beat that of the index to become in the money. As an alternative to using a broadly based index as the reference index, the company could use an index of the prices of stocks in the same industrial sector as the company.
5 Interestingly, if an option is settled in cash rather than by the company issuing new shares, it is subject to 
the accounting treatment proposed here. (However, there is no economic difference between an option that is 
settled in cash and one that is settled by selling new shares to the employee.)
6 In fact the income statement is likely be less volatile if stock options are revalued. When the company does  
well, income is reduced by revaluing the executive stock options. When the company does badly, it is increased.
7 Sometimes there is an upper and lower bound to the number of shares which will vest and sometimes S0 
and ST are defined as average stock prices over a number of days preceding the grant data and vesting date, 
respectively. For an analysis of MSUs, see J. C. Hull and A. White, “The Valuation of Market-Leveraged Stock Units,” Journal of Derivatives, 21, 3 (Spring 2014): 85–90.16.4 VALUATION
Accounting standards give companies quite a bit of latitude in choosing a method for 
valuing employee stock options. In this section we review some of the alternatives.
M16_HULL0654_11_GE_C16.indd   375 30/04/2021   17:32376 CHAPTER 16
Using the Black–Scholes–Merton Model
A frequently used approach is based on what is known as the option’s expected life. This 
is the average time for which employees hold the option before it is exercised or expires. 
The expected life can be approximately estimated from historical data on the early exercise behavior of employees and reflects the vesting period, the impact of  employees 
leaving the company, and the tendency we mentioned in Section 16.1 for employee stock options to be exercised earlier than regular options. The Black–Scholes–Merton model is used with the life of the option, T , set equal to the expected life. The volatility is usually 
estimated from several years of historical data as described in Section 15.4.
It should be emphasized that using the Black–Scholes–Merton formula in this way has 
no theoretical validity. There is no reason why the value of a European stock option with the time to maturity, T , set equal to the expected life should be approximately the same as 
the value of the American-style employee stock option that we are interested in. However, the results given by the model are not unreasonable in many situations. Companies, when reporting their employee stock option expense, will frequently mention the volatility and expected life used in their Black–Scholes–Merton computations.
Example 16.1
A company grants 1,000,000 options to its executives on November 1, 2021. The 
stock price on that date is $30 and the strike price of the options is also $30. The  
options last for 10 years and vest after three years. The company has issued  similar at-the-money options for the last 10 years. The average time to exercise 
or expiry of these options is 4.5 years. The company therefore decides to use an  
“expected life” of 4.5 years. It estimates the long-term volatility of the stock price, using 5 years of historical data, to be 25%. The present value of dividends during the next 4.5 years is estimated to be $4. The 4.5-year zero-coupon risk-free interest rate is 5%. The option is therefore valued using the Black–Scholes– Merton model (adjusted for dividends in the way described in Section 15. 12) 
with 
S0=30-4=26, K=30, r=5,, s=25,, and T=4.5. The Black– 
Scholes–Merton formula gives the value of one option as $6.31. Hence, the income statement expense is 
1,000,000*6.31, or $6,310,000.
Binomial Tree Approach
A more sophisticated approach to valuing employee stock options involves building a binomial tree as outlined in Chapter 13 and adjusting the rules used when rolling back through the tree to reflect (a) whether the option has vested, (b) the probability of the employee leaving the company, and (c) the probability of the employee choosing to  
exercise the option. The terms of the option define whether the option has vested at different nodes of the tree. Historical data on turnover rates for employees can be used to estimate the probability of the option being either prematurely exercised or forfeited at a node because the employee leaves the company. The probability of an employee  
choosing to exercise the option at different nodes of the tree is more difficult to  quantify. Clearly this probability increases as the ratio of the stock price to the strike 
price increases and as the time to the option’s maturity declines. If enough historical data is available, the probability of exercise as a function of these two variables can be estimated—at least approximately.
M16_HULL0654_11_GE_C16.indd   376 30/04/2021   17:32Employee Stock Options 377
Example 16.2
Suppose a company grants stock options that last 8 years and vest after 3 years.  
The stock price and strike price are both $40. The stock price volatility is 30%, the 
risk-free rate is 5%, and the company pays no dividends. Figure 16. 1 shows how a 
four-step tree could be used to value the option. (This is for illustration; in practice more time steps would be used.) In this case, 
s=0.3, ∆t=2, and r=0.05, so 
that, with the notation of Chapter 13, a=e0.05*2=1.1052, u=e0.322=1.5285, 
d=1>u=0.6543, and p=1a-d2>1u-d2=0.5158. The probability on the “up 
branches” is 0.5158 and the probability on the “down branches” is 0.4842. There are three nodes where early exercise could be desirable: D, G, and H. (The option has not vested at node B and is not in the money at the other nodes prior to maturity.) We assume that the probabilities that the holder will choose to exercise  
at nodes D, G, and H (conditional on no earlier exercise) have been estimated as 40%, 80%, and 30%, respectively. We suppose that the probability of an em ployee 
leaving the company during each time step is 5%. (This corresponds to an em - 
ployee turnover rate of approximately 2.5% per year.) For the purposes of the calculation, it is assumed that employees always leave at the end of a time period.  
If an employee leaves the company before an option has vested or when the option is out of the money, the option is forfeited. In other cases the option must be exercised immediately.

The value of the option at the final nodes is its intrinsic value. Consider the 
nodes at time 6 years. Nodes I and J are easy. Since these nodes are certain to lead 
to nodes where the option is worth nothing, the value of the option is zero at  
these nodes. At node H there is a 30% chance that the employee will choose to  exercise the option. In cases where the employee does not choose to exercise, there 
is a 5% chance that the employee leaves the company and has to exercise. The total probability of exercise is therefore 
0.3+0.7*0.05=0.335. If the option is 
exercised, its value is 61.14-40=21.14. If it is not exercised, its value is
e-0.05*210.5158*53.45+0.4842*02=24.95
The value of the option at node H is therefore
0.335*21.14+0.665*24.95=23.67
The value at node G is similarly
0.81*102.83+0.19*106.64=103.56
We now move on to the nodes at time 4 years. At node F the option is clearly 
worth zero. At node E there is a 5% chance that the employee will forfeit the option because he or she leaves the company and a 95% chance that the option will be retained. In the latter case the option is worth
e-0.05*210.5158*23.67+0.4842*02=11.05
The option is therefore worth 0.95*11.05=10.49. At node D there is a 0.43 
probability that the option will be exercised and a 0.57 chance that it will be retained. The value of the option is 56.44.
Consider next the initial node and the nodes at time 2 years. The option has not 
vested at these nodes. There is a 5% chance that the option will be forfeited and a  
95% chance that it will be retained for a further 2 years. This leads to the  valuations shown in Figure 16. 1. The valuation of the option at the initial node 
is 14.97. (This compares with a valuation of 17.98 for a regular option using the 
same tree.)
Exercise Multiple Approach
Hull and White suggest a simple model where an employee exercises as soon as the option has vested and the ratio of the stock price to the strike price is above a certain level.
8 They refer to the ratio of stock price to strike price that triggers exercise as the 
“exercise multiple”. The option can be valued using a binomial or trinomial tree. As outlined in Section 27.6, it is important to construct a binomial or trinomial tree where nodes lie on the stock prices that will lead to exercise. For example, if the strike price is  
$30 and the assumption is that employees exercise when the ratio of the stock price to the strike price is 1.5, the tree should be constructed so that there are nodes at a stock  
price level of $45. The tree calculations are similar to those for Example 16.2 and take account of the probability of an employee leaving the company.
9 To estimate the 
 exercise multiple, it is necessary to calculate from historical data the average ratio of  
8 See J. C. Hull and A. White, “How to value employee stock options,” Financial Analysts Journal, 60, 1 
 (January/February 2004): 3–9.
9 Software implementing this approach is on www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull.
M16_HULL0654_11_GE_C16.indd   378 30/04/2021   17:32Employee Stock Options 379
stock price to strike price at the time of exercise. (Exercises at maturity and those arising  
from the termination of the employee’s job are not included in the calculation of the 
 average.) This may be easier to estimate from historical data than the expected life 
because the latter is quite heavily dependent on the particular path that has been  followed by the stock’s price.
A Market-Based Approach
One way of valuing an employee stock option is to see what the market would pay for 
it. Cisco was the first to try this in 2006. It proposed selling options with the exact terms of its employee stock options to institutional investors. This approach was rejected by the SEC on the grounds that the range of investors bidding for the options was not wide enough.
Zions Bancorp has suggested an alternative approach. It proposed that securities 
providing payoffs mirroring those actually realized by its employees be sold. Suppose that the strike price for a particular grant to employees is $40 and it turns out that 1% of employees exercise after exactly 5 years when the stock price is $60, 2% exercise after exactly 6 years when the stock price is $65, and so on. Then 1% of the securities owned by an investor will provide a $20 payoff after 5 years, 2% will provide a payoff of $25 after 6 years, and so on.
Zions Bancorp tested the idea using its own stock option grant to its employees. It 
sold the securities using a Dutch auction process. In this individuals or companies can submit a bid indicating the price they are prepared to pay and the number of options they are prepared to buy. The clearing price is the highest bid such that the aggregate number of options sought at that price or a higher price equals or exceeds the number of options for sale. Buyers who have bid more than the clearing price get their orders filled at the clearing price and the buyer who bid the clearing price gets the remainder. Zions Bancorp announced that it had received SEC approval for its market-based approach in October 2007, but the approach has not been used to any great extent.
Dilution
The fact that a company issues new stock when an employee stock option is exercised leads to some dilution for existing stock holders because new shares are being sold to  
employees at below the current stock price. It is natural to assume that this  dilution  
takes place at the time the option is exercised. However, this is not the case. As explained in Section 15.10, stock prices are diluted when the market first hears about a stock option grant. The possible exercise of options is anticipated and immediately reflected in the stock price. This point is emphasized by the example in Business  
Snapshot 15.3.
The stock price immediately after a grant is announced to the public reflects any 
dilution. Provided that this stock price is used in the valuation of the option, it is not necessary to adjust the option price for dilution. In many instances the market expects a  
company to make regular stock option grants and so the market price of the stock anticipates dilution even before the announcement is made.
If a company is contemplating a stock option grant that will surprise the market, the 
cost can be calculated as described in Example 15.7. This cost can be compared with 
benefits such as lower regular employee remuneration and less employee turnover.
M16_HULL0654_11_GE_C16.indd   379 30/04/2021   17:32380 CHAPTER 16
No discussion of employee stock options would be complete without mentioning a 
backdating scandal. Backdating is the practice of marking a document with a date that precedes the current date.
Suppose that a company decides to grant at-the-money options to its executives on 
April 30 when the stock price is $50. If the stock price was $42 on April 3, it is  tempting to 
behave as if those the options were granted on April 3 and use a strike price of $42. This is  
legal provided that the company reports the options as $8 in the money on the date when the decision to grant the options is made, April 30. But it is illegal for the company to  
report the options as at-the-money and granted on April 3. The value on April 3 of an option with a strike price of $42 is much less than its value on April 30. Shareholders are misled about the true cost of the decision to grant options if the  company reports the 
options as granted on April 3.
Prior to 2002, it appears that backdating was not uncommon. Early research by 
Yermack shows that stock prices tend to increase after reported grant dates.
10 Lie 
extended Yermack’s work, showing that stock prices also tended to decrease before reported grant dates.
11 The period covered by this research was 1993 to 2002. The 
research clearly shows that stock prices tended to be at a low point on reported grant dates. The stock price on a reported grant date was on average lower than that on each of the 30 days before the grant date and lower than that on each of the 30 days after the  
grant date. Statistical tests carried out by the researchers showed that this could not have happened by chance. The research led regulators to conclude that backdating was occurring. In August 2002, the SEC required option grants by public companies to be reported within two business days. Heron and Lie showed that this led to a  dramatic  
change in the stock price patterns around the grant date—particularly for those  companies that complied with the SEC rule.
12 Reported grant dates were no longer 
low-stock-price dates. It might be argued that the patterns observed by Yermack and 
Lie can be explained by managers choosing grant dates after bad news or before good news, but Heron and Lie’s research shows that, although there might been a tendency for this to happen, it is not the major explanation of the Yermack and Lie results.
Estimates of the number of companies that illegally backdated stock option grants in  
the United States vary widely. Tens and maybe hundreds of companies seem to have engaged in the practice. Many companies seem to have adopted the view that it was acceptable to backdate up to one month. Some CEOs resigned when their backdating practices came to light. In August 2007, Gregory Reyes of Brocade Communications Systems, Inc., became the first CEO to be tried for backdating stock option grants. Allegedly, Mr. Reyes said to a human resources employee: “It is not illegal if you do not get caught.” In June 2010, he was sentenced to 18 months in prison and fined $15 million.
Companies involved in backdating have had to restate past financial statements and 
have been defendants in class action suits brought by shareholders who claim to have lost money as a result of backdating. For example, McAfee announced in December 16.5 THE BACKDATING SCANDAL

2007 that it would restate earnings between 1995 and 2005 by $137.4 million. In 2006, it 
set aside $13.8 million to cover lawsuits.
SUMMARY
Until 2005, at-the-money stock option grants were a very attractive form of compensa-tion. They had no impact on the income statement and were very valuable to employees. Accounting standards now require options to be expensed.
There are a number of different approaches to valuing employee stock options. A 
common approach is to use the Black–Scholes–Merton model with the life of the option set equal to the expected time to exercise or expiry of the option. Another approach is to assume that options are exercised as soon as the ratio of the stock price to the strike price reaches a certain barrier. A third approach is to try and estimate the  
relationship between the probability of exercise, the ratio of the stock price to the strike price, and the time to option maturity. A fourth approach is to create a market for securities that replicate the payoffs on the options.
Academic research has shown beyond doubt that many companies have engaged in 
the illegal practice of backdating stock option grants in order to reduce the strike price, while still contending that the options were at the money. The first prosecutions for this illegal practice were in 2007.

the outcome of games. ” Discuss this viewpoint.
 16.3. In what way would the benefits of backdating be reduced if a stock option grant had to be revalued at the end of each quarter?
 16.4. Explain how you would do an analysis similar to that of Yermack and Lie to determine whether the backdating of stock option grants was happening.
 16.5. On May 31 a company’s stock price is $70. One million shares are outstanding. An  executive exercises 100,000 stock options with a strike price of $50. What is the impact of 
this on the stock price?
 16.6. The notes accompanying a company’s financial statements say: “Our executive stock options last 10 years and vest after 4 years. We valued the options granted this year using the Black–Scholes–Merton model with an expected life of 5 years and a volatility of 20%. ” What does this mean? Discuss the modeling approach used by the company.
 16.7 . In a Dutch auction of 10,000 options, bids are as follows: A bids $30 for 3,000; B bids $33 for 2,500; C bids $29 for 5,000; D bids $40 for 1,000; E bids $22 for 8,000; and  
F bids $35 for 6,000. What is the result of the auction? Who buys how many at what price?
 16.8. A company has granted 500,000 options to its executives. The stock price and strike price are both $40. The options last for 12 years and vest after 4 years. The company decides to value the options using an expected life of 5 years and a volatility of 30% per  
annum. The company pays no dividends and the risk-free rate is 4%. What will the  company report as an expense for the options on its income statement?
 16.9. A company’s CFO says: “The accounting treatment of stock options is crazy. We 
granted 10,000,000 at-the-money stock options to our employees last year when the stock price was $30. We estimated the value of each option on the grant date to be $5. At our year-end the stock price had fallen to $4, but we were still stuck with a $50 million charge to the P&L. ” Discuss.

What is the value of the option obtained by using this expected life in Black–Scholes– 
Merton?

The company decides to value the options using an expected life of 6 years and a volatility of 22% per annum. Dividends on the stock are $1 per year, payable halfway through each year, and the risk-free rate is 5%. What will the company report as an expense for the options on its income statement?

Options on  
Stock Indices and  
Currencies
Options on stock indices and currencies were introduced in Chapter 10. This chapter 
discusses them in more detail. It explains how they work and reviews some of the ways they can be used. In the second half of the chapter, the valuation results in Chapter 15 are extended to cover European options on a stock paying a known dividend yield. It is  
then argued that both stock indices and currencies are analogous to stocks paying  dividend yields. This enables the results for options on a stock paying a dividend yield 
to be applied to these types of options as well.17 CHAPTER  
Several exchanges trade options on stock indices. Some of the indices track the move-ment of the market as a whole. Others are based on the performance of a particular sector (e.g., computer technology, oil and gas, transportation, or telecoms). Among the index options traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) are American and European options on the S&P 100 (OEX and XEO), European options on the S&P 500 (SPX), European options on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJX), and Euro-pean options on the Nasdaq 100 (NDX). In Chapter 10, we explained that the CBOE trades LEAPS and flex options on individual stocks. It also offers these option products on indices.
One index option contract is usually on 100 times the index. (Note that the Dow 
Jones index used for index options is 0.01 times the usually quoted Dow Jones index.) Index options are settled in cash. This means that, on exercise of the option, the holder of a call option contract receives 
1S-K2*100 in cash and the writer of the option pays 
this amount in cash, where S is the value of the index at the close of trading on the day 
of the exercise and K is the strike price. Similarly, the holder of a put option contract receives 
1K-S2*100 in cash and the writer of the option pays this amount in cash.
Portfolio Insurance
Portfolio managers can use options on a well-diversified index to limit their downside risk. Suppose that the value of the index today is 
S0. Consider a manager in charge of a 
well-diversified portfolio whose beta is 1.0. A beta of 1.0 implies that the returns from the  17.1 OPTIONS ON STOCK INDICES
M17_HULL0654_11_GE_C17.indd   384 12/05/2021   17:46Options on Stock Indices and Currencies 385
portfolio mirror those from the index. Assuming the dividend yield from the portfolio is 
the same as the dividend yield from the index, the percentage changes in the value of the  
portfolio can be expected to be approximately the same as the percentage changes in the value of the index. Since each contract is on 100 times the index, it  follows that the value  
of the portfolio is protected against the possibility of the index falling below K if, for each  
100S0 dollars in the portfolio, the manager buys one put option contract with strike price  
K. Suppose that the manager’s portfolio is worth $500,000 and the value of the index is   
currently 1,000. The portfolio is worth 500 times the index. The manager can obtain 
 insurance against the value of the portfolio dropping below $450,000 in the next three 
months by buying five three-month put option contracts on the index with a strike price of 900.
To illustrate how the insurance works, consider the situation where the index drops 
to 880 in three months. The portfolio will be worth about $440,000. The payoff from the options will be 
5*1900-8802*100=+10,000, bringing the total value of the 
portfolio up to the insured value of $450,000.
When the Portfolio’s Beta Is Not 1.0
If the portfolio’s beta 1b2 is not 1.0, b put options must be purchased for each 100S0 
 dollars in the portfolio, where S0 is the current value of the index. Suppose that the 
$500,000 portfolio just considered has a beta of 2.0 instead of 1.0. We continue to 
assume that the index is 1,000. The number of put options required is
2.0*500,000
1,000*100=10
rather than 5 as before.
To calculate the appropriate strike price, the capital asset pricing model can be used 
(see the appendix to Chapter 3). Suppose that the risk free rate is 12%, the dividend yield on both the index and the portfolio is 4%, and protection is required against the value of the portfolio dropping below $450,000 in the next three months. Under the 
Value of index in three months: 1,040
Return from change in index: 40>1,000, or 4% per three months
Dividends from index: 0.25*4=1, per three months
Total return from index: 4+1=5, per three months
Risk-free interest rate: 0.25*12=3, per three months
Excess return from index  
over risk-free interest rate: 5-3=2, per three months
Expected excess return from portfolio  
over risk-free interest rate: 2*2=4, per three months
Expected return from portfolio: 3+4=7, per three months
Dividends from portfolio: 0.25*4=1, per three months
Expected increase in value of portfolio: 7-1=6, per three months
Expected value of portfolio: +500,000*1.06=+530,000Table 17.1 Calculation of expected value of portfolio when the index is 1,040 in

capital asset pricing model, the expected excess return of a portfolio over the risk-free 
rate is assumed to equal beta times the excess return of the index portfolio over the risk- free rate. The model enables the expected value of the portfolio to be calculated for  
 different values of the index at the end of three months. Table 1 7.1 shows the calcula-
tions for the case where the index is 1,040. In this case, the expected value of the   
portfolio at the end of the three months is $530,000. Similar calculations can be carried 
out for other values of the index at the end of the three months. The results are shown in  
Table 17.2. The strike price for the options that are purchased should be the index level  
corresponding to the protection level required on the portfolio. In this case, the  
protection level is $450,000 and so the correct strike price for the 10 put option  contracts 
that are purchased is 960.

To illustrate how the insurance works, consider what happens if the value of the  
index falls to 880. As shown in Table 1 7.2, the value of the portfolio is then about  
$370,000. The put options pay off 1960-8802*10*100=+80,000, and this is exactly 
what is necessary to move the total value of the portfolio manager’s position up from $370,000 to the required level of $450,000.
The examples in this section show that there are two reasons why the cost of hedging 
increases as the beta of a portfolio increases. More put options are required and they have a higher strike price.Value of index

1 Approximately 1% of $500,000, or $5,000, will be earned in dividends over the next three months. If we  
want the insured level of $450,000 to include dividends, we can choose a strike price corresponding to 
$445,000 rather than $450,000. This is 955.17.2 CURRENCY OPTIONS
Currency options are primarily traded in the over-the-counter market. The advantage 
of this market is that large trades are possible, with strike prices, expiration dates, and other features tailored to meet the needs of corporate treasurers. Although currency options do trade on NASDAQ OMX in the United States, the exchange-traded market for these options is much smaller than the over-the-counter market.
An example of a European call option is a contract that gives the holder the right to  
buy one million euros with U.S. dollars at an exchange rate of 1.1000 U.S. dollars per  
euro. If the actual exchange rate at the maturity of the option is 1.1500, the payoff is 
M17_HULL0654_11_GE_C17.indd   386 12/05/2021   17:46Options on Stock Indices and Currencies 387
1,000,000*11.1500-1.10002=+50,000. Similarly, an example of a European put  
option is a contract that gives the holder the right to sell ten million Australian 
 dollars for U.S. dollars at an exchange rate of 0.7000 U.S. dollars per Australian 
 dollar. If the actual exchange rate at the maturity of the option is 0.6700, the payoff is 
10,000,000*10.7000-0.67002=+300,000.
For a corporation wishing to hedge a foreign exchange exposure, foreign currency 
options are an alternative to forward contracts. A U.S. company due to receive sterling at  
a known time in the future can hedge its risk by buying put options on sterling that 
mature at that time. The hedging strategy guarantees that the exchange rate applicable to  
the sterling will not be less than the strike price, while allowing the company to benefit from any favorable exchange-rate movements. Similarly, a U.S. company due to pay  sterling at a known time in the future can hedge by buying calls on sterling that mature at  
that time. This hedging strategy guarantees that the cost of the sterling will not be greater 
than a certain amount while allowing the company to benefit from favorable exchange-rate movements. Whereas a forward contract locks in the exchange rate for a future transaction, an option provides a type of insurance. This is not free. It costs nothing to enter into a forward transaction, but options require a premium to be paid up front.
Range Forwards
A range forward contract is a variation on a standard forward contract for hedging 
foreign exchange risk. Consider a U.S. company that knows it will receive one million pounds sterling in three months. Suppose that the three-month forward exchange rate is 1.3200 dollars per pound. The company could lock in this exchange rate for the dollars it receives by entering into a short forward contract to sell one million pounds  sterling  
in three months. This would ensure that the amount received for the one million  
pounds is $1,320,000.
An alternative is to buy a European put option with a strike price of 
K1 and sell a 
European call option with a strike price K2, where K161.32006K2. This is known as a  
short position in a range forward contract. The payoff is shown in Figure 17.1a. Both 
options are on one million pounds. If the exchange rate in three months proves to be less  
than K1, the put option is exercised and as a result the company is able to sell the 
Figure 17.1 Payoffs from (a) short and (b) long position in a range forward contract.

one million pounds at an exchange rate of K1. If the exchange rate is between K1 and K2, 
neither option is exercised and the company gets the current exchange rate for the 
one million pounds. If the exchange rate is greater than K2, the call option is exercised 
against the company and the one million pounds is sold at an exchange rate of K2. The 
exchange rate realized for the one million pounds is shown in Figure 1 7.2.
If the company knew it was due to pay rather than receive one million pounds in three 
months, it could sell a European put option with strike price K1 and buy a European 
call option with strike price K2. This is a long position in a range forward contract and  
the payoff is shown in Figure 1 7.1b. If the exchange rate in three months proves to be less 
than K1, the put option is exercised against the company and as a result the company 
buys the one million pounds it needs at an exchange rate of K1. If the exchange rate is  
between K1 and K2, neither option is exercised and the company buys the one million 
pounds at the current exchange rate. If the exchange rate is greater than K2, the call 
option is exercised and the company is able to buy the one million pounds at an exchange rate of 
K2. The exchange rate paid for the one million pounds is the same 
as that received for the one million pounds in the earlier example and is shown in Figure 17.2.
In practice, a range forward contract is set up so that the price of the put option 
equals the price of the call option. This means that it costs nothing to set up the range forward contract, just as it costs nothing to set up a regular forward contract. Suppose that the U.S. and British interest rates are both 2%, so that the spot exchange rate is 1.3200 (the same as the forward exchange rate). Suppose further that the exchange rate volatility is 14%. We can use DerivaGem to show that a European put with strike price 1.3000 to sell one pound has the same price as a European call option with a strike price  
of 1.3414 to buy one pound. (Both are worth 0.0273.) Setting 
K1=1.3000 and 
K2=1.3414 therefore leads to a contract with zero cost in our example.Figure 17.2 Exchange rate realized when a range forward contract is used

As the strike prices of the call and put options in a range forward contract are moved 
together, the range forward contract becomes a regular forward contract. The (short) 
range forward contract in Figure 1 7.1a becomes a short forward contract and the (long) 
range forward contract in Figure 1 7.1b becomes a long forward contract.
17.3 OPTIONS ON STOCKS PAYING KNOWN DIVIDEND YIELDS
In this section we produce a simple rule that enables valuation results for European options on a non-dividend-paying stock to be extended so that they apply to European options on a stock paying a known dividend yield. Later we show how this enables us to  
value options on stock indices and currencies.
Suppose that the dividend yield per year (measured with continuous compounding) 
is q. Dividends cause stock prices to reduce on the ex-dividend date by the amount of the  
dividend payment. The payment of a dividend yield at rate q  therefore causes the growth 
rate in the stock price to be less than it would otherwise be by an amount q. If, with a  
dividend yield of q, the stock price grows from 
S0 today to ST at time T, then in the 
absence of dividends it would grow from S0 today to ST eqT at time T. Alternatively, in 
the absence of dividends it would grow from S0e-qT today to ST at time T.
This argument shows that we get the same probability distribution for the stock price 
at time T in each of the following two cases:
1. The stock starts at price S0 and provides a dividend yield at rate q.
2. The stock starts at price S0e-qT and pays no dividends.
This leads to a simple rule. When valuing a European option lasting for time T on a 
stock paying a known dividend yield at rate q, we reduce the current stock price from S0  
to S0e-qT and then value the option as though the stock pays no dividends.2
Lower Bounds for Option Prices
As a first application of this rule, consider the problem of determining bounds for the price of a European option on a stock paying a dividend yield at rate q. Substituting 
S0e-qT for S0 in equation (11. 4), we see that a lower bound for the European call option 
price, c, is given by
 cÚmax1S0e-qT-Ke-rT, 02 (17.1)
We can also prove this directly by considering the following two portfolios:
Portfolio A:  one European call option plus an amount of cash equal to Ke-rT
Portfolio B: e-qT shares with dividends being reinvested in additional shares.
To obtain a lower bound for a European put option, we can similarly replace S0 by 
S0e-qT in equation (11. 5) to get
 pÚmax1Ke-rT-S0e-qT, 02 (17.2)
2 This rule is analogous to the one developed in Section 15.12 for valuing a European option on a stock  
paying known cash dividends. (In that case we concluded that it is correct to reduce the stock price by the 
present value of the dividends; in this case we discount the stock price at the dividend yield rate.)
M17_HULL0654_11_GE_C17.indd   389 12/05/2021   17:46390 CHAPTER 17
This result can also be proved directly by considering the following portfolios:
Portfolio C  :  one European put option plus e-qT shares with dividends on the shares 
being reinvested in additional shares
Portfolio D : an amount of cash equal to Ke-rT.
Put–Call Parity
Replacing S0 by S0e-qT in equation (11. 6) we obtain put–call parity for an option on a 
stock paying a dividend yield at rate q:
 c+Ke-rT=p+S0e-qT (17.3)
This result can also be proved directly by considering the following two portfolios:
Portfolio A : one European call option plus an amount of cash equal to Ke-rT
Portfolio C  :  one European put option plus e-qT shares with dividends on the shares 
being reinvested in additional shares.
Both portfolios are both worth max 1ST, K2 at time T. They must therefore be worth the  
same today, and the put–call parity result in equation (1 7.3) follows. For American 
options, the put–call parity relationship is (see Problem 17.10)
S0e-qT-K…C-P…S0-Ke-rT
Pricing Formulas
By replacing S0 by S0e-qT in the Black–Scholes–Merton formulas, equations (15. 20)  
and (15. 21), we obtain the price, c, of a European call and the price, p, of a European 
put on a stock paying a dividend yield at rate q as
 c=S0e-qT N1d12-Ke-rT N1d22 (17.4)
 p=Ke-rT N1-d22-S0e-qT N1-d12 (17.5)
Since
lnS0e-qT
K=lnS0
K-qT
it follows that d1 and d2 are given by
 d1=ln1S0>K2+1r-q+s2>22T
s2T
 d2=ln1S0>K2+1r-q-s2>22T
s2T=d1-s2T
These results were first derived by Merton.3 As discussed in Chapter 15, the word 
 dividend should, for the purposes of option valuation, be defined as the reduction in the 
stock price on the ex-dividend date arising from any dividends declared. If the dividend yield rate is known but not constant during the life of the option, equations (1 7.4)  
3 See R. C. Merton, “Theory of Rational Option Pricing, ” Bell Journal of Economics and Management  
Science, 4 (Spring 1973): 141 –83.
M17_HULL0654_11_GE_C17.indd   390 12/05/2021   17:46Options on Stock Indices and Currencies 391
and (1 7.5) are still true, with q equal to the average annualized dividend yield during the  
option’s life.
Differential Equation and Risk-Neutral Valuation
To prove the results in equations (1 7.4) and (1 7.5) more formally, we can either solve 
the differential equation that the option price must satisfy or use risk-neutral valuation.
When we include a dividend yield of q in the analysis in Section 15.6, the differential 
equation (15. 16) becomes4
 0f
0t+1r-q2S0f
0S+1
2 s2S202f
0S2=rf (17.6)
Like equation (15. 16), this does not involve any variable affected by risk preferences. 
Therefore the risk-neutral valuation procedure described in Section 15.7 can be used.
In a risk-neutral world, the total return from the stock must be r. The dividends 
 provide a return of q. The expected growth rate in the stock price must therefore be 
r-q. It follows that the risk-neutral process for the stock price is
 dS=1r-q2S dt+sS dz (17.7)
To value a derivative dependent on a stock that provides a dividend yield equal to q, we  
set the expected growth rate of the stock equal to r-q and discount the expected payoff   
at rate r. When the expected growth rate in the stock price is r-q, the expected stock 
price at time T is S0e1r-q2T. A similar analysis to that in the appendix to Chapter 15 gives 
the expected payoff for a call option in a risk-neutral world as
e1r-q2T S0N1d12-KN1d22
where d1 and d2 are defined as above. Discounting at rate r  for time T  leads to 
equation (1 7.4).
4 See Technical Note 6 at www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull/TechnicalNotes for a proof of this.17.4 VALUATION OF EUROPEAN STOCK INDEX OPTIONS
In valuing index futures in Chapter 5, we assumed that the index could be treated as an  
asset paying a known yield. In valuing index options, we make similar assumptions. 
This means that equations (1 7.1) and (1 7.2) provide a lower bound for European index  
options; equation (1 7.3) is the put–call parity result for European index options; 
 equations (1 7.4) and (1 7.5) can be used to value European options on an index; and  
the binomial tree approach can be used for American options. In all cases, S0 is equal to  
the current value of the index, s is equal to the volatility of the index, and q is equal to  
the average annualized dividend yield on the index during the life of the option expressed with continuous compounding.
Example 17.1
Consider a European call option on an index that is two months from maturity. The  
current value of the index is 930, the exercise price is 900, the risk-free  interest rate is  
M17_HULL0654_11_GE_C17.indd   391 12/05/2021   17:46392 CHAPTER 17
8% per annum, and the volatility of the index is 20% per annum.  Dividend yields of  
0.2% and 0.3% (expressed with continuous compounding) are expected in the first  
month and the second month, respectively. In this case S0=930, K=900,
r=0.08, s=0.2, and T=2>12. The total dividend yield during the option’s life  
is 0.2,+0.3,=0.5,. This corresponds to 3% per annum. Hence, q=0.03 and
 d1=ln1930>9002+10.08-0.03+0.22>22*2>12
0.222>12=0.5444
 d2=ln1930>9002+10.08-0.03-0.22>22*2>12
0.222>12=0.4628
N1d12=0.7069,   N1d22=0.6782
so that the call price, c, is given by equation (1 7.4) as
c=930*0.7069e-0.03*2>12-900*0.6782e-0.08*2>12=51.83
One contract, if on 100 times the index, would cost $5,183.
The calculation of q should include only dividends for which the ex-dividend dates 
occur during the life of the option. In the United States ex-dividend dates tend to occur during the first week of February, May, August, and November. At any given time the correct value of q is therefore likely to depend on the life of the option. This is even more true for indices in other countries. In Japan, for example, all companies tend to use the same ex-dividend dates.
If the absolute amount of the dividend that will be paid on the stocks underlying the  
index (rather than the dividend yield) is assumed to be known, the basic Black–  
Scholes–Merton formulas can be used with the initial stock price being reduced by  
the present value of the dividends. This is the approach recommended in Chapter 15 for  
a stock paying known dividends. However, it may be difficult to implement for a  
broadly based stock index because it requires a knowledge of the dividends expected on every stock underlying the index.
It is sometimes argued that, in the long run, the return from investing a certain 
amount of money in a well-diversified stock portfolio is almost certain to beat the return from investing the same amount of money in a bond portfolio. If this were so, a long-dated put option allowing the stock portfolio to be sold for the value of the bond portfolio should not cost very much. In fact, as indicated by Business Snapshot 1 7.1, it 
is quite expensive.
Forward Prices and the Estimation of Dividend Yields
Define F0 as the forward price of the index for a contract with maturity T . As shown by 
equation (5.3), F0=S0e1r-q2T. This means that the equations for the European call 
price c and the European put price p in equations (1 7.4) and (1 7.5) can be written
c=F0e-rT N1d12-Ke-rT N1d22 (17.8)
 p=Ke-rT N1-d22-F0e-rT N1-d12 (17.9)
where
d1=ln 1F0>K2+s2T>2
s2T and d2=ln 1F0>K2-s2T>2
s2T
M17_HULL0654_11_GE_C17.indd   392 12/05/2021   17:46Options on Stock Indices and Currencies 393
The put–call parity relationship in equation (1 7.3) can be written
c+Ke-rT=p+F0e-rT
or
 F0=K+1c-p2erT (17.10)
Working with forward prices and equations (1 7.8) and (1 7.9) is attractive because it 
avoids the need to estimate the dividend yield on the index directly. The dividend yield 
expected by the market is incorporated into forward prices. Futures prices for stock indices can be assumed to be the same as forward prices and so futures markets can be used to estimate forward prices for the maturities of the futures contracts that trade. If,  
as is not uncommon, European put and call options with the same strike price and maturity date are traded, equation (1 7.10) can be used to provide an estimate of the 
forward price of the index for that maturity date.
Once forward prices for a number of different maturity dates have been obtained (at  
least approximately), a smooth function describing the forward price as a function of maturity can be estimated, and equations (1 7.8) and (1 7.9) can be used to determine the 
prices of European index options for a range of maturities.
When American options on an index are valued, the average dividend yield during 
the life of the option must be estimated explicitly.
5 Because F0=S0e1r-q2T, the average Business Snapshot 1 7.1 Can We Guarantee that Stocks Will Beat Bonds in  
the Long Run?
It is often said that if you are a long-term investor you should buy stocks rather than bonds. Consider a U.S. fund manager who is trying to persuade investors to  
buy, as a long-term investment, an equity fund that is expected to mirror the  
S&P 500. The manager might be tempted to offer purchasers of the fund a  guarantee that their return will be at least as good as the return on risk-free bonds 
over the next 10 years. Historically stocks have outperformed bonds in the United States over almost any 10-year period. It appears that the fund manager would not be giving much away.
In fact, this type of guarantee is surprisingly expensive. Suppose that an equity 
index is 1,000 today, the dividend yield on the index is 1% per annum, the volatility of the index is 15% per annum, and the 10-year risk-free rate is 5% per annum. To outperform bonds, the stocks underlying the index must earn more than 5% per annum. The dividend yield will provide 1% per annum. The capital gains on the stocks must therefore provide 4% per annum. This means that we require the index level to be at least 
1,000e0.04*10=1,492 in 10 years.
A guarantee that the return on $1,000 invested in the index will be greater than the  
return on $1,000 invested in bonds over the next 10 years is therefore equivalent to  
the right to sell the index for 1,492 in 10 years. This is a European put option on the  
index and can be valued from equation ( 17.5) with S0=1,000, K=1,492, r=5,,
s=15,, T=10, and q=1,. The value of the put option is 169.7. This shows that 
the guarantee contemplated by the fund manager is worth about 17% of the fund—hardly something that should be given away!
5 As explained in Section 21.5, the dividend yield can be made a function of time when American options 
are valued.

A European call and put option with the same strike price and maturity date can also 
be used to estimate q. From equation (1 7.3),
q=-1
T ln c-p+Ke-rT
S0
For a particular strike price and time to maturity, the estimates of q calculated from this equation are liable to be unreliable. But when the results from many matched pairs of calls and puts are combined, a clearer picture of the term structure of dividend yields being assumed by the market emerges.
17.5 VALUATION OF EUROPEAN CURRENCY OPTIONS
To value currency options, we define S0 as the spot exchange rate. To be precise, S0 is 
the value of one unit of the foreign currency in U.S. dollars. As explained in Sec-tion 5.10, a foreign currency is analogous to a stock paying a known dividend yield. The owner of foreign currency receives a yield equal to the risk-free interest rate, 
rf, in the 
foreign currency. Equations (1 7.1) and (1 7.2), with q replaced by rf, provide bounds for 
the European call price, c, and the European put price, p:
cÚmax1S0e-rfT-Ke-rT, 02 and pÚmax1Ke-rT-S0e-rfT, 02
Equation (1 7.3), with q replaced by rf, provides the put–call parity result for European 
currency options:
c+Ke-rT=p+S0e-rfT
Finally, equations (1 7.4) and (1 7.5) provide the pricing formulas for European currency 
options when q is replaced by r f  :
c=S0e-rfT N1d12-Ke-rT N1d22 (17.11)
 p=Ke-rT N1-d22-S0e-rfT N1-d12 (17.12)
where
 d1=ln1S0>K2+1r-rf+s2>22T
s2T
 d2=ln1S0>K2+1r-rf-s2>22T
s2T=d1-s2T
Both the domestic interest rate, r, and the foreign interest rate, r f  , are the rates for a 
maturity T.
Example 17.2
Consider a 4-month European call option on the British pound. Suppose that the  
current exchange rate is 1.6000, the exercise price is 1.6000, the risk-free interest rate  
in the United States is 8% per annum, the risk-free interest rate in Britain is 11% per  
M17_HULL0654_11_GE_C17.indd   394 12/05/2021   17:46Options on Stock Indices and Currencies 395
annum, and the option price is 4.3 cents. In this case, S0=1.6, K=1.6, r=0.08, 
rf=0.11, T=0.3333, and c=0.043. The implied volatility can be calculated by 
trial and error. A volatility of 20% gives an option price of 0.0639; a volatility of  
10% gives an option price of 0.0285; and so on. The implied volatility is 14.1%.
Put and call options on a currency are symmetrical in that a put option to sell one unit 
of currency A for currency B at strike price K is the same as a call option to buy K units of B with currency A at strike price 
1>K (see Problem 17.6).
Using Forward Exchange Rates
Because banks and other financial institutions trade forward contracts on foreign exchange rates actively, forward exchange rates are often used for valuing options.  
From equation (5.9), the forward exchange rate, 
F0, for a maturity T is given by
F0=S0e1r-rf2T
This relationship allows equations (1 7.11) and (1 7.12) to be simplified to
c=e-rT 3F0N1d12-KN1d224 (17.13)
 p=e-rT 3KN1-d22-F0N1-d124 (17.14)
where
 d1=ln1F0>K2+s2T>2
s2T
 d2=ln1F0>K2-s2T>2
s2T=d1-s2T
Equations (1 7.13) and (1 7.14) are the same as equations (1 7.8) and (1 7.9). As we shall 
see in Chapter 18, a European option on the spot price of any asset can be valued in terms of the price of a forward or futures contract on the asset using equations (1 7.13) 
and (1 7.14). The maturity of the forward or futures contract must be the same as the 
maturity of the European option.
17.6 AMERICAN OPTIONS
As described in Chapter 13, binomial trees can be used to value American options on indices and currencies. As in the case of American options on a non-dividend-paying stock, the parameter determining the size of up movements, u, is set equal to 
es1∆t, 
where s is the volatility and ∆t is the length of time steps. The parameter  determining 
the size of down movements, d, is set equal to 1>u, or e-s1∆t. For a non-dividend- 
paying stock, the probability of an up movement is
p=a-d
u-d
where a=er∆t. For options on indices and currencies, the formula for p is the same,  
but a is defined differently. In the case of options on an index,
 a=e1r-q2∆t (17.15)
M17_HULL0654_11_GE_C17.indd   395 12/05/2021   17:46396 CHAPTER 17
where q is the dividend yield on the index. In the case of options on a currency,
 a=e1r-rf2∆t (17.16)
where rf is the foreign risk-free rate. Example 13.1 in Section 13.11 shows how a two-step 
tree can be constructed to value an option on an index. Example 13.2 shows how a three-
step tree can be constructed to value an option on a currency. Further examples of the use of binomial trees to value options on indices and currencies are given in Chapter 21.
In some circumstances, it is optimal to exercise American currency and index options 
prior to maturity. Thus, American currency and index options are worth more than their European counterparts. In general, call options on high-interest currencies and put options on low-interest currencies are the most likely to be exercised early. The reason is that a high-interest currency is expected to depreciate and a low-interest currency is expected to appreciate. Similarly, call options on indices with high-dividend yields and put options on indices with low-dividend yields are most likely to be exercised early.
SUMMARY
The index options trading on exchanges are settled in cash. On exercise of an index call option contract, the holder typically receives 100 times the amount by which the index exceeds the strike price. Similarly, on exercise of an index put option contract, the holder receives 100 times the amount by which the strike price exceeds the index. Index options can be used for portfolio insurance. If the value of the portfolio mirrors the  
index, it is appropriate to buy one put option contract for each 
100S0 dollars in the  
portfolio, where S0 is the value of the index. If the portfolio does not mirror the index,  
b put option contracts should be purchased for each 100S0 dollars in the portfolio, 
where b is the beta of the portfolio from the capital asset pricing model. The strike price 
of the put options purchased should reflect the level of insurance required.
Most currency options are traded in the over-the-counter market. They can be used 
by corporate treasurers to hedge a foreign exchange exposure. For example, a U.S.  corporate treasurer who knows that the company will be receiving sterling at a certain 
time in the future can hedge by buying put options that mature at that time. Similarly, a  
U.S. corporate treasurer who knows that the company will be paying sterling at a  
certain time in the future can hedge by buying call options that mature at that time. Currency options can also be used to create a range forward contract. This is a zero-cost contract that can be used to provide downside protection while giving up some of the upside for a company with a known foreign exchange exposure.
The Black–Scholes–Merton formula for valuing European options on a non-dividend- 
paying stock can be extended to cover European options on a stock paying a known  
dividend yield. The extension can be used to value European options on stock indices and currencies because:
1. A stock index is analogous to a stock paying a dividend yield. The dividend yield is the dividend yield on the stocks that make up the index.
2. A foreign currency is analogous to a stock paying a dividend yield. The foreign risk-free interest rate plays the role of the dividend yield.
Binomial trees can be used to value American options on stock indices and currencies.

Futures Options 
and Black’s Model
The options we have considered so far provide the holder with the right to buy or sell a 
certain asset by a certain date for a certain price. They are sometimes termed options on spot or spot options because, when the options are exercised, the sale or purchase of the  
asset at the agreed-on price takes place immediately. In this chapter we move on to  consider options on futures, also known as futures options. In these contracts, exercise of 
the option gives the holder a position in a futures contract.
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission in the U.S. authorized the trading of 
options on futures on an experimental basis in 1982. Permanent trading was approved in 1987, and since then the popularity of the contract has grown very fast.
In this chapter we consider how futures options work and the differences between 
these options and spot options. We examine how futures options can be priced, explore the relative pricing of futures options and spot options, and discuss what are known as futures-style options.
In 1976, Fischer Black proposed a model, now known as Black’s model, for valuing 
European options on futures.
1 As this chapter will show, the model has proved to be an 
important alternative to the Black–Scholes–Merton model for valuing a wide range of European spot options.18 CHAPTER  
1 See F. Black, “The Pricing of Commodity Contracts, ” Journal of Financial Economics, 3 (1976), 167–79.18.1 NATURE OF FUTURES OPTIONS
A futures option is the right, but not the obligation, to enter into a futures contract at a  
certain futures price by a certain date. Specifically, a futures call option is the right to enter into a long futures contract at a certain price; a futures put option is the right to  
enter into a short futures contract at a certain price. Futures options are generally American; that is, they can be exercised any time during the life of the contract.
If a futures call option is exercised, the holder acquires a long position in the 
 underlying futures contract plus a cash amount equal to the most recent settlement 
futures price minus the strike price. If a futures put option is exercised, the holder acquires a short position in the underlying futures contract plus a cash amount equal to  
the strike price minus the most recent settlement futures price. As the following  examples show, the effective payoff from a futures call option is 
max1F-K, 02 and 
M18_HULL0654_11_GE_C18.indd   401 12/05/2021   17:50402 CHAPTER 18
the effective payoff from a futures put option is max 1K-F, 02, where F is the futures 
price at the time of exercise and K is the strike price.
Example 18.1
Suppose it is August 15 and a trader has one September futures call option 
 contract on copper with a strike price of 320 cents per pound. One futures 
 contract is on 25,000 pounds of copper. Suppose that the futures price of copper 
for delivery in September is currently 331 cents, and at the close of trading on August 14 (the last settlement) it was 330 cents. If the option is exercised, the trader receives a cash amount of
25,000*1330-3202 cents=+2,500
plus a long position in a futures contract to buy 25,000 pounds of copper in  September. If desired, the position in the futures contract can be closed out 
 immediately. This would leave the trader with the $2,500 cash payoff plus an 
amount
25,000*1331-3302 cents=+250
reflecting the change in the futures price since the last settlement. The total payoff from exercising the option on August 15 is $2,750, which equals 
25,000 1F-K2, 
where F is the futures price at the time of exercise and K is the strike price.
Example 18.2
A trader has one December futures put option on corn with a strike price of 600 cents per bushel. One futures contract is on 5,000 bushels of corn. Suppose that the current futures price of corn for delivery in December is 580, and the most recent settlement price is 579 cents. If the option is exercised, the trader receives a cash amount of
5,000*1600-5792 cents=+1,050
plus a short position in a futures contract to sell 5,000 bushels of corn in December. If desired, the position in the futures contract can be closed out. This would leave the trader with the $1,050 cash payoff minus an amount
5,000*1580-5792 cents=+50
reflecting the change in the futures price since the last settlement. The net payoff  from exercise is $1,000, which equals 
5,0001K-F2, where F  is the futures price at 
the time of exercise and K is the strike price.
Expiration Months
Futures options are referred to by the delivery month of the underlying futures contract —not by the expiration month of the option. As mentioned earlier, most futures options are American. The expiration date of a futures option contract is usually a short period of time before the last trading day of the underlying futures contract. (For example, the CME Group Treasury bond futures option expires on the latest Friday that precedes by at least two business days the end of the month before the futures delivery month.) Exceptions are the CME Group mid-curve Eurodollar and the mid-curve three-month SOFR contracts where the futures contract expires much later than the options contract.
M18_HULL0654_11_GE_C18.indd   402 12/05/2021   17:50Futures Options and Black’s Model 403
Options on Interest Rate Futures
In Chapter 6, we discussed the interest rate futures contracts traded by the CME Group. 
Options on interest rate futures are also traded by the exchange. Consider, for example, the Treasury bond futures option contract. This is an option to enter into a Treasury bond futures contract. One Treasury bond futures contract is for the delivery of bonds with a principal of $100,000. The price of the Treasury bond futures option is quoted as  
a percentage of the face value of the underlying Treasury bonds to the nearest sixty- fourth of 1%.
As explained in Chapter 6, the CME’s most popular contract on short-term interest 
rates has traditionally been its Eurodollar futures contract. As LIBOR is phased out, the exchange expects this to be replaced by the three-month SOFR futures contract. Options on Eurodollar futures have been popular and are expected to be replaced by options on three-month SOFR futures, which were launched by the CME in January 2020. It will be recalled that the Eurodollar rate is a forward-looking rate (a borrowing rate for the next three months) whereas SOFR is a backward-looking rate (calculated by compounding overnight rates for the previous three months). Eurodollar and three-month SOFR futures are designed so that a one-basis-point move in the futures price is  
worth $25 per contract. The same is true of options on these futures contracts.
Interest rate futures option contracts work in the same way as the other futures 
options contracts discussed in this chapter. For example, in addition to the cash payoff, the holder of a call option obtains a long position in the futures contract when the option is exercised and the option writer obtains a corresponding short position. The total payoff from the call, including the value of the futures position, is 
max1F-K, 02, 
where F is the futures price at the time of exercise and K is the strike price.
Interest rate futures prices increase when bond prices increase (i.e., when interest rates  
fall). They decrease when bond prices decrease (i.e., when interest rates rise). An investor who thinks that short-term interest rates will rise can speculate by buying  
put options on Eurodollar or SOFR futures, whereas an investor who thinks the rates will fall can speculate by buying call options on Eurodollar or SOFR futures. An investor who thinks that long-term interest rates will rise can speculate by buying put options on Treasury note futures or Treasury bond futures, whereas an investor who thinks the rates will fall can speculate by buying call options on these instruments.
Example 18.3
Suppose that the June SOFR futures is 99.35 (indicating an interest rate of 0.65% 
per annum) and that an investor expects short-term interest rates to decline so that  
overnight rates between June and September are less than 0.5% per annum.  Suppose also that the price of a call option with a strike price of 99.50 is 0.05  
(i.e., 5 basis points). The investor could buy a call option contract with a strike 
price of 99.50 for 
+25*5, or $125. If the investor exercises the call when the 
futures price is 99.70 (indicating an interest rate of 0.3% per annum), the payoff  to the investor is 
+25*20, or $500, and the investor’s profit is $375.
Example 18.4
It is August and the futures price for the December Treasury bond contract is 96-09 (or 
96 9
32=96.28125). The yield on long-term government bonds is about 
6.4% per annum. An investor who feels that this yield will fall by December  
might choose to buy December calls with a strike price of 98. Assume that the 
M18_HULL0654_11_GE_C18.indd   403 12/05/2021   17:50404 CHAPTER 18
price of these calls is 1 -04 (or 1 4
64=1.0625, of the principal). If long-term rates 
fall to 6% per annum and the Treasury bond futures price rises to 100-00, the 
investor will make a net profit per $100 of bond futures of
100.00-98.00-1.0625=0.9375
Since one option contract is for the purchase or sale of instruments with a face value of $100,000, the investor’s profit is $937.50 per option contract bought.
18.2 REASONS FOR THE POPULARITY OF FUTURES OPTIONS
It is natural to ask why people choose to trade options on futures rather than options on the underlying asset. The main reason appears to be that a futures contract is, in many circumstances, more liquid and easier to trade than the underlying asset. Furthermore, a  
futures price is known immediately from trading on the futures exchange, whereas the spot price of the underlying asset may not be so readily available.
Consider Treasury bonds. The market for Treasury bond futures is much more active 
than the market for any particular Treasury bond. Also, a Treasury bond futures price is  
known immediately from exchange trading. By contrast, the current market price of a bond can be obtained only by contacting one or more dealers. It is not surprising that investors would rather take delivery of a Treasury bond futures contract than Treasury bonds.
Futures on commodities are also often easier to trade than the commodities them-
selves. For example, it is much easier and more convenient to make or take delivery of a live-cattle futures contract than it is to make or take delivery of the cattle.
An important point about a futures option is that exercising it does not usually lead 
to delivery of the underlying asset, as in most circumstances the underlying futures  contract is closed out prior to delivery. Futures options are therefore normally even-
tually settled in cash. This is appealing to many investors, particularly those with  
 limited capital who may find it difficult to come up with the funds to buy the underlying 
asset when an option on spot is exercised. Another advantage sometimes cited for futures options is that futures and futures options are traded on the same exchange. This facilitates hedging, arbitrage, and speculation. It also tends to make the markets more efficient. A final point is that futures options entail lower transaction costs than spot options in many situations.
18.3 EUROPEAN SPOT AND FUTURES OPTIONS
The payoff from a European call option with strike price K on the spot price of an asset is
max1ST-K, 02
where ST is the spot price at the option’s maturity. The payoff from a European call 
option with the same strike price on the futures price of the asset is
max1FT-K, 02
where FT is the futures price at the option’s maturity. If the futures contract matures at  
M18_HULL0654_11_GE_C18.indd   404 12/05/2021   17:50Futures Options and Black’s Model 405
the same time as the option, then FT=ST and the two options are equivalent. 
 Similarly, a European futures put option is worth the same as its spot put option 
 counterpart when the futures contract matures at the same time as the option.
Most of the futures options that trade are American-style. However, as we shall see, it 
is useful to study European futures options because the results that are obtained can be 
used to value the corresponding European spot options.
18.4 PUT–CALL PARITY
In Chapter 11, we derived a put–call parity relationship for European stock options. We now consider a similar argument to derive a put–call parity relationship for  European futures options. Consider European futures call and put options, both with 
strike price K  and time to expiration T . We can form two portfolios:
Portfolio A:  a European futures call option plus an amount of cash equal to 
Ke-rT
Portfolio B:   a European futures put option plus a long futures contract plus an amount of cash equal to 
F0e-rT, where F0 is the futures price
In portfolio A, the cash can be invested at the risk-free rate, r, and grows to K at time T.  
Let FT be the futures price at maturity of the option. If FT7K, the call option in 
 portfolio A is exercised and portfolio A is worth FT. If FT…K, the call is not exercised 
and portfolio A is worth K. The value of portfolio A at time T is therefore
max1FT, K2
In portfolio B, the cash can be invested at the risk-free rate to grow to F0 at time T. The 
put option provides a payoff of max1K-FT, 02. The futures contract provides a payoff 
of FT-F0.2 The value of portfolio B at time T is therefore
F0+1FT-F02+max1K-FT, 02=max1FT, K2
Because the two portfolios have the same value at time T and European options cannot 
be exercised early, it follows that they are worth the same today. The value of portfolio A today is
c+Ke-rT
where c is the price of the futures call option. The daily settlement process ensures that the 
futures contract in portfolio B is worth zero today. Portfolio B is therefore worth
p+F0e-rT
where p is the price of the futures put option. Hence
 c+Ke-rT=p+F0e-rT (18.1)
The difference between this put–call parity relationship and the one for a non-  
dividend-paying stock in equation (11. 6) is that the stock price, S0, is replaced by  
the discounted futures price, F0e-rT.
2 This analysis assumes that a futures contract is like a forward contract and settled at the end of its life 
rather than on a day-to-day basis.
M18_HULL0654_11_GE_C18.indd   405 12/05/2021   17:50406 CHAPTER 18
As shown in Section 18. 3, when the underlying futures contract matures at the same 
time as the option, European futures and spot options are the same. Equation (18. 1) 
therefore gives a relationship between the price of a call option on the spot price, the 
price of a put option on the spot price, and the futures price when both options mature at the same time as the futures contract.
Example 18.5
Suppose that the price of a European call option on a commodity for delivery in  
six months is $0.56 per ounce when the strike price is $8.50. Assume that the 
futures price for delivery in six months is currently $8.00, and the risk-free interest rate for an investment that matures in six months is 10% per annum. From a rearrangement of equation (18. 1), the price of a European put option on the spot 
price with the same maturity and exercise date as the call option is
0.56+8.50e-0.1*6>12-8.00e-0.1*6>12=1.04
For American futures options, the put–call relationship is (see Problem 18.15)
 F0e-rT-K6C-P6F0-Ke-rT (18.2)
18.5 BOUNDS FOR FUTURES OPTIONS
The put–call parity relationship in equation (18. 1) provides bounds for European call  
and put options. Because the price of a put, p, cannot be negative, it follows from 
 equation (18. 1) that
c+Ke-rTÚF0e-rT
so that
 cÚmax11F 0-K2e-rT, 02 (18.3)
Similarly, because the price of a call option cannot be negative, it follows from equa-
tion (18. 1) that
Ke-rT…F0e-rT+p
so that
 pÚmax11K-F02e-rT, 02 (18.4)
These bounds are analogous to the ones derived for European stock options in 
 Chapter 11. The prices of European call and put options are very close to their lower 
bounds when the options are deep in the money. To see why this is so, we return to the put–call parity relationship in equation (18. 1). When a call option is deep in the money, 
a put option with the same strike price is deep out of the money. This means that p is  
very close to zero. The difference between c and its lower bound equals p, so that the price of the call option must be very close to its lower bound. A similar argument applies to put options.
Because American futures options can be exercised at any time, we must have
CÚmax1F0-K, 02
and
PÚmax1K-F0, 02
Thus, assuming interest rates are positive, the lower bound for an American option  
M18_HULL0654_11_GE_C18.indd   406 12/05/2021   17:50Futures Options and Black’s Model 407
price is always higher than the lower bound for the corresponding European option 
price. There is always some chance that an American futures option will be exercised early.
18.6 DRIFT OF A FUTURES PRICE IN A RISK-NEUTRAL WORLD
There is a general result that allows us to use the analysis in Section 17.3 for futures options. This result is that in a risk-neutral world a futures price behaves in the same way as a stock paying a dividend yield at the domestic risk-free interest rate r.
One clue that this might be so is given by noting that the put–call parity relationship 
for futures options prices is the same as that for options on a stock paying a dividend yield at rate q when the stock price is replaced by the futures price and 
q=r (compare 
equations (18. 1) and (1 7.3)).
To prove the result formally, we calculate the drift of a futures price in a risk-neutral 
world. We define Ft as the futures price at time t  and suppose the settlement dates are 
at times 0, ∆t, 2∆t,cIf we enter into a long futures contract at time 0, its value is 
zero. At time ∆t, it provides a payoff of F∆t-F0. If r is the very-short-term ( ∆t-period) 
interest rate at time 0, risk-neutral valuation gives the value of the contract at time 0 as
e-r∆tEn3F∆t-F04
where En denotes expectations in a risk-neutral world. We must therefore have
e-r∆t En1F∆t-F02=0
showing that
En1F∆t2=F0
Similarly, En1F2∆t2=F∆t, En1F3∆t2=F2∆t, and so on. Putting many results like this 
together, we see that
En1FT2=F0
for any time T.
The drift of the futures price in a risk-neutral world is therefore zero. From equa-
tion ( 17.7), the futures price behaves like a stock providing a dividend yield q equal to r.  
This result is a very general one. It is true for all futures prices and does not depend on any assumptions about interest rates, volatilities, etc.
3
The usual assumption made for the process followed by a futures price F in the risk- 
neutral world is
 dF=sF dz (18.5)
where s is a constant.
Differential Equation
For another way of seeing that a futures price behaves like a stock paying a dividend 
yield at rate q, we can derive the differential equation satisfied by a derivative  dependent  
3 As we will discover in Chapter 28, a more precise statement of the result is: “ A futures price has zero drift in 
the traditional risk-neutral world where the numeraire is the money market account. ” A zero-drift stochastic 
process is known as a martingale. A forward price is a martingale in a different risk-neutral world. This is one where the numeraire is a zero-coupon bond maturing at time T.
M18_HULL0654_11_GE_C18.indd   407 12/05/2021   17:50408 CHAPTER 18
on a futures price in the same way as we derived the differential equation for a derivative 
dependent on a non-dividend-paying stock in Section 15.6. This is4
 0f
0t+1
2 02f
0F2 s2F2=rf (18.6)
It has the same form as equation (1 7.6) with q set equal to r. This confirms that, for the 
purpose of valuing derivatives, a futures price can be treated in the same way as a stock providing a dividend yield at rate r.
4 See Technical Note 7 at www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull/TechnicalNotes for a proof of this.
5 See F. Black, “The Pricing of Commodity Contracts, ” Journal of Financial Economics, 3 (March 1976): 
167–79.18.7 BLACK’S MODEL FOR VALUING FUTURES OPTIONS
European futures options can be valued by extending the results we have produced. Fischer Black was the first to show this in a paper published in 1976.
5 Assuming that 
the futures price follows the (lognormal) process in equation (18. 5), the European call 
price c and the European put price p for a futures option are given by equations (1 7.4) 
and (1 7.5) with S0 replaced by F0 and q=r:
 c=e-rT3F0N1d12-KN1d224 (18.7)
 p=e-rT3KN1-d22-F0N1-d124 (18.8)
where
 d1=ln1F0>K2+s2T>2
s2T
 d2=ln1F0>K2-s2T>2
s2T=d1-s2T
and s is the volatility of the futures price. When the cost of carry and the convenience 
yield are functions only of time, it can be shown that the volatility of the futures price is  
the same as the volatility of the underlying asset.
Example 18.6
Consider a European put futures option on a commodity. The time to the option’s 
maturity is 4 months, the current futures price is $20, the exercise price is $20, the  
risk-free interest rate is 9% per annum, and the volatility of the futures price is 25%  
per annum. In this case, F0=20, K=20, r=0.09, T=4>12, s=0.25, and 
ln1F0>K2=0, so that
 d1=s2T
2=0.07216
d2=-s2T
2=-0.07216

and the put price p is given by
p=e-0.09*4>12120*0.5288-20*0.47122=1.12
or $1.12.
18.8 USING BLACK’S MODEL INSTEAD OF  
BLACK–SCHOLES–MERTON
The results in Section 18. 3 show that European futures options and European spot 
options are equivalent when the option contract matures at the same time as the futures 
contract. Specifically, equations (18. 7) and (18. 8) provide the price of a European  
option on the spot price of a asset where F0 is the futures price of the asset for a 
 contract maturing at the same time as the option.
Example 18.7
Consider a six-month European call option on the spot price of gold, that is, an 
option to buy one ounce of gold in the spot market in six months. The strike price is $1,200, the six-month futures price of gold is $1,240, the risk-free rate of interest is 5% per annum, and the volatility of the futures price is 20%. The option is the same as a six-month European option on the six-month futures price. The value of the option is therefore given by equation (18. 7) as
e-0.05*0.531,240N1d12-1,200N1d224
where
 d1=ln11,240>1,2002+0.22*0.5>2
0.2*20.5=0.3026
 d2=ln11,240>1,2002-0.22*0.5>2
0.2*20.5=0.1611
It is $88.37.
Traders like to use Black’s model rather than Black–Scholes–Merton to value Euro-
pean spot options. It has a fairly general applicability. The underlying asset can be a consumption or investment asset and it can provide income to the holder. Often 
F0 is  
set equal to the forward price rather than the futures price. When interest rates are assumed to be deterministic, forward and futures prices are equal and so this is valid.  
As we will see later in the book, when interest rates are stochastic it is valid to set 
F0 
equal to the forward price provided that r is the risk-free rate for maturity T.
The big advantage of Black’s model is that it avoids the need to estimate the income 
(or convenience yield) on the underlying asset. The futures or forward price that is used in the model incorporate the market’s estimate of this income.
Equations (1 7.13) and (1 7.14) show Black’s model being used to value European 
options on the spot value of a currency. In this case, Black’s model avoids the need to  
estimate the foreign risk-free rate explicity because all information needed about this rate is captured by 
F0. Equations (1 7.8) and (1 7.9) show Black’s model being used to  
value European options on the spot value of an index. In this case, dividends on the  
underlying portfolio of stocks do not have to be estimated explicitly because all  
information needed about dividends is captured by F0.
M18_HULL0654_11_GE_C18.indd   409 12/05/2021   17:50410 CHAPTER 18
When considering stock indices in Section 17.4, we explained that put–call parity is 
used to imply the forward prices for maturities for which there are actively traded 
options. Interpolation is then used to estimate forward prices for other maturities. The same approach can be used for a wide range of other underlying assets.
18.9 VALUATION OF FUTURES OPTIONS USING BINOMIAL TREES
This section examines, more formally than in Chapter 13, how binomial trees can be used to price futures options. A key difference between futures options and stock options is that there are no up-front costs when a futures contract is entered into.
Suppose that the current futures price is 30 and that it will move either up to 33 or 
down to 28 over the next month. We consider a one-month call option on the futures with a strike price of 29 and ignore daily settlement. The situation is as indicated in Figure 18.1. If the futures price proves to be 33, the payoff from the option is 4 and the 
value of the futures contract is 3. If the futures price proves to be 28, the payoff from the  
option is zero and the value of the futures contract is 
-2.6
To set up a riskless hedge, we consider a portfolio consisting of a short position in  
one option contract and a long position in ∆ futures contracts. If the futures price 
moves up to 33, the value of the portfolio is 3∆-4; if it moves down to 28, the value 
of the portfolio is -2∆. The portfolio is riskless when these are the same, that is,  
when
3∆-4=-2∆
or ∆=0.8.
For this value of ∆, we know the portfolio will be worth 3*0.8-4=-1.6 in one  
month. Assume a risk-free interest rate of 6%. The value of the portfolio today  
must be
-1.6e-0.06*1>12=-1.592
6 There is an approximation here in that the gain or loss on the futures contract is not realized at time T. It is  
realized day by day between time 0 and time T . However, as the length of the time step in a multistep 
 binomial tree becomes shorter, the approximation becomes better.Figure 18.1 Futures price movements in numerical example.

M18_HULL0654_11_GE_C18.indd   410 12/05/2021   17:50Futures Options and Black’s Model 411
The portfolio consists of one short option and ¢ futures contracts. Because the value of 
the futures contract today is zero, the value of the option today must be 1.592.
A Generalization
We can generalize this analysis by considering a futures price that starts at F0 and is 
anticipated to rise to F0u or move down to F0d over the time period T. We consider an 
option maturing at time T and suppose that its payoff is fu if the futures price moves up 
and fd if it moves down. The situation is summarized in Figure 18. 2.
The riskless portfolio in this case consists of a short position in one option combined 
with a long position in ∆ futures contracts, where
∆=fu-fd
F0u-F0d
The value of the portfolio at time T is then always
1F0u-F02∆-fu
Denoting the risk-free interest rate by r, we obtain the value of the portfolio today as
31F0u-F02∆-fu4e-rT
Another expression for the present value of the portfolio is -f, where f is the value of 
the option today. It follows that
-f=31F0u-F02∆-fu4e-rT
Substituting for ∆ and simplifying reduces this equation to
 f=e-rT3 pfu+11-p2fd4 (18.9)
where
 p=1-d
u-d (18.10)
This agrees with the result in Section 13.9. Equation (18. 10) gives the risk-neutral 
 probability of an up movement.

M18_HULL0654_11_GE_C18.indd   411 12/05/2021   17:50412 CHAPTER 18
In the numerical example considered previously (see Figure 18. 1), u=1.1,
d=0.9333, r=0.06, T=1>12,  fu=4, and fd=0. From equation (18. 10),
p=1-0.9333
1.1-0.9333=0.4
and, from equation (18. 9),
f=e-0.06*1>1230.4*4+0.6*04=1.592
This result agrees with the answer obtained for this example earlier.
Multistep Trees
Multistep binomial trees are used to value American-style futures options in much the 
same way that they are used to value options on stocks. This is explained in Section 13.9. The parameter u defining up movements in the futures price is 
es1∆t, where s is the 
volatility of the futures price and ∆t is the length of one time step. The probability of an  
up movement in the future price is that in equation (18. 10):
p=1-d
u-d
Example 13.3 illustrates the use of multistep binomial trees for valuing a futures option. Example 21.3 in Chapter 21 provides a further illustration.
18.10   AMERICAN FUTURES OPTIONS vs. AMERICAN SPOT OPTIONS
Traded futures options are in practice usually American. Assuming that the risk-free rate of interest, r, is positive, there is always some chance that it will be optimal to  exercise an American futures option early. American futures options are therefore 
worth more than their European counterparts.
It is not generally true that an American futures option is worth the same as the 
corresponding American spot option when the futures and options contracts have the same maturity.
7 Suppose, for example, that there is a normal market with futures prices 
consistently higher than spot prices prior to maturity. An American futures call option must be worth more than the corresponding American spot call option. The reason is that in some situations the futures option will be exercised early, in which case it will provide a greater profit to the holder. Similarly, an American futures put option must be worth less than the corresponding American spot put option. If there is an inverted market with futures prices consistently lower than spot prices, the reverse must be true. American futures call options are worth less than the corresponding American spot call option, whereas American futures put options are worth more than the corresponding American spot put option.
The differences just described between American futures options and American spot 
options hold true when the futures contract expires later than the options contract as well as when the two expire at the same time. In fact, the later the futures contract expires the greater the differences tend to be.
7 The spot option “corresponding” to a futures option is defined here as one with the same strike price and 
the same expiration date.
M18_HULL0654_11_GE_C18.indd   412 12/05/2021   17:50Futures Options and Black’s Model 413
18.11   FUTURES-STYLE OPTIONS
Some exchanges, particularly those in Europe, trade what are termed futures-style 
options. These are futures contracts on the payoff from an option. Normally a trader who buys (sells) an option, whether on the spot price of an asset or on the futures price of an asset, pays (receives) cash up front. By contrast, traders who buy or sell a futures-style option post margin in the same way that they do on a regular futures contract (see Chapter 2). The contract is settled daily as with any other futures contract and the final settlement price is the payoff from the option. Just as a futures contract is a bet on what the future price of an asset will be, a futures-style option is a bet on what the payoff  from an option will be.
8 If interest rates are constant, the futures price in a futures-style 
option is the same as the forward price in a forward contract on the option payoff. Our analysis of forward contracts in Chapter 5 shows that this is the current option price compounded forward at the risk-free rate.
Black’s model in equations (18. 7) and (18. 8) gives the current European option price. 
The futures price in a futures-style call option is therefore
F0N1d12-K N1d22
and the futures price in a futures-style put option is
K N1-d22-F0N1-d12
where d1 and d2 are as defined in equations (18. 7) and (18. 8). These formulas do not 
depend on the level of interest rates. They are correct for a futures-style option on a futures contract and a futures-style option on the spot value of an asset. In the first  
case, 
F0 is the current futures price for the contract underlying the option; in the  second 
case, it is the current futures price for a futures contract on the underlying asset  maturing at the same time as the option.
The put–call parity relationship for a futures-style options is
p+F0=c+K
An American futures-style option can be exercised early, in which case there is an 
immediate final settlement at the option’s intrinsic value. But as it turns out, it is never optimal to exercise an American futures-style option early because the futures price of the option is always greater than the intrinsic value. This type of American futures-style option can therefore be treated as though it is European.
SUMMARY
Futures options require delivery of the underlying futures contract on exercise. When a call is exercised, the holder acquires a long futures position plus a cash amount equal to the excess of the futures price over the strike price. Similarly, when a put is exercised the  
holder acquires a short position plus a cash amount equal to the excess of the strike  
8 For a more detailed discussion of futures-style options, see D. Lieu, “Option Pricing with Futures-Style 
Margining, ” Journal of Futures Markets, 10, 4 (1990), 327–38. For pricing when interest rates are stochastic, 
see R.-R. Chen and L. Scott, “Pricing Interest Rate Futures Options with Futures-Style Margining. ” Journal 
of Futures Markets, 13, 1 (1993) 15–22.

price over the futures price. The futures contract that is delivered usually expires slightly 
later than the option.
A futures price behaves in the same way as a stock that provides a dividend yield 
equal to the risk-free rate, r. This means that the results produced in Chapter 17 for options on a stock paying a dividend yield apply to futures options if we replace the stock price by the futures price and set the dividend yield equal to the risk-free  interest 
rate. Pricing formulas for European futures options were first produced by Fischer Black in 1976. They assume that the futures price is lognormally distributed at the option’s expiration.
If the expiration dates for the option and futures contracts are the same, a European 
futures option is worth exactly the same as the corresponding European spot option. This result is often used to value European spot options. The result is not true for American options. If the futures market is normal, an American futures call is worth more than the corresponding American spot call option, while an American futures put is worth less than the corresponding American spot put option. If the futures market is inverted, the reverse is true.

The Greek Letters19 CHAPTER  
A financial institution that sells an option to a client in the over-the-counter markets is 
faced with the problem of managing its risk. If the option happens to be the same as one that is traded actively on an exchange or in the OTC market, the financial institution can neutralize its exposure by buying the same option as it has sold. But when the option has been tailored to the needs of a client and does not correspond to the products traded by exchanges, hedging the exposure is far more difficult.
In this chapter we discuss some of the alternative approaches to this problem. We 
cover what are commonly referred to as the “Greek letters”, or simply the “Greeks”. Each Greek letter measures a different dimension to the risk in an option position and the aim of a trader is to manage the Greeks so that all risks are acceptable. The analysis presented in this chapter is applicable to market makers in options on an exchange as well as to traders working in the over-the-counter market for financial institutions.
Toward the end of the chapter, we will consider the creation of options synthetically. 
This turns out to be very closely related to the hedging of options. Creating an option position synthetically is essentially the same task as hedging the opposite option position. For example, creating a long call option synthetically is the same as hedging a short position in the call option.
1 As shown in Chapters 13 and 15, the expected return is irrelevant to the pricing of an option. It is given here 
because it can have some bearing on the effectiveness of a hedging procedure.19.1 ILLUSTRATION
In the next few sections we use as an example the position of a financial institution that has sold for $300,000 a European call option on 100,000 shares of a non-dividend- paying stock. We assume that the stock price is $49, the strike price is $50, the risk-free interest rate is 5% per annum, the stock price volatility is 20% per annum, the time to maturity is 20 weeks (0.3846 years), and the expected return from the stock is 13% per annum.
1 With our usual notation, this means that
S0=49, K=50, r=0.05, s=0.20, T=0.3846, m=0.13
The Black–Scholes–Merton price of the option is about $240,000. (This is because the 
M19_HULL0654_11_GE_C19.indd   417 12/05/2021   17:56418 CHAPTER 19
One strategy open to the financial institution is to do nothing. This is sometimes referred 
to as a naked position. It is a strategy that works well if the stock price is below $50 at the 
end of the 20 weeks. The option then costs the financial institution nothing and it makes a profit of $300,000. A naked position works less well if the call is exercised because the financial institution then has to buy 100,000 shares at the market price  prevailing in 20 
weeks to cover the call. The cost to the financial institution is 100,000 times the amount  
by which the stock price exceeds the strike price. For example, if after 20 weeks the stock price is $60, the option costs the financial institution $1,000,000. This is considerably greater than the $300,000 charged for the option.
As an alternative to a naked position, the financial institution can adopt a covered 
position. This involves buying 100,000 shares as soon as the option has been sold. If the option is exercised, this strategy works well, but in other circumstances it could lead to a  
significant loss. For example, if the stock price drops to $40, the financial institution loses $900,000 on its stock position. This is also considerably greater than the $300,000 charged for the option.
3
Neither a naked position nor a covered position provides a good hedge. If the 
assumptions underlying the Black–Scholes–Merton formula hold, the cost to the  financial institution should always be $240,000 on average for both approaches.
4 But 
on any one occasion the cost is liable to range from zero to over $1,000,000. A good 
hedge would ensure that the cost is always close to $240,000.
A Stop-Loss Strategy
One interesting hedging procedure that is sometimes proposed involves a stop-loss strategy. To illustrate the basic idea, consider an institution that has written a call option with strike price K  to buy one unit of a stock. The hedging procedure involves buying one 
unit of the stock as soon as its price rises above K  and selling it as soon as its price falls 
below K. The objective is to hold a naked position whenever the stock price is less than K  
and a covered position whenever the stock price is greater than K. The  procedure is 
designed to ensure that at time T  the institution owns the stock if the option closes in the  
money and does not own it if the option closes out of the money. In the situation  illustrated in Figure 19.1, it involves buying the stock at time 
t1, selling it at time t2, 
buying it at time t3, selling it at time t4, buying it at time t5, and delivering it at time T.
2 A call option on a non-dividend-paying stock is a convenient example with which to develop our ideas. The 
points that will be made apply to other types of options and to other derivatives.
3 Put–call parity shows that the exposure from writing a covered call is the same as the exposure from writing 
a naked put.
4 More precisely, the present value of the expected cost is $240,000 for both approaches assuming that 
 appropriate risk-adjusted discount rates are used.value of an option to buy one share is $2.40.) The financial institution has therefore 
sold a product for $60,000 more than its theoretical value. But it is faced with the  problem of hedging the risks.

19.2 NAKED AND COVERED POSITIONS
M19_HULL0654_11_GE_C19.indd   418 12/05/2021   17:56The Greek Letters 419
As usual, we denote the initial stock price by S0. The cost of setting up the hedge 
 initially is S0 if S07K and zero otherwise. It seems as though the total cost, Q, of 
 writing and hedging the option is the option’s initial intrinsic value:
 Q=max1S0-K, 02 (19.1)
This is because all purchases and sales subsequent to time 0 are made at price K . If this 
were in fact correct, the hedging procedure would work perfectly in the absence of 
transaction costs. Furthermore, the cost of hedging the option would always be less than its Black–Scholes–Merton price. Thus, a trader could earn riskless profits by  writing options and hedging them.
There are two key reasons why equation (19.1) is incorrect. The first is that the cash 
flows to the hedger occur at different times and must be discounted. The second is that 
purchases and sales cannot be made at exactly the same price K. This second point is  
critical. If we assume a risk-neutral world with zero interest rates, we can  justify 
 ignoring the time value of money. But we cannot legitimately assume that both   
purchases and sales are made at the same price. If markets are efficient, the hedger 
cannot know whether, when the stock price equals K, it will continue above or below K.
As a practical matter, purchases must be made at a price 
K+P and sales must be 
made at a price K-P, for some small positive number P. Thus, every purchase and  
subsequent sale involves a cost (apart from transaction costs) of 2P. A natural response 
on the part of the hedger is to monitor price movements more closely, so that P is 
reduced. Assuming that stock prices change continuously, P can be made arbitrarily 
small by monitoring the stock prices closely. But as P is made smaller, trades tend to  
occur more frequently. Thus, the lower cost per trade is offset by the increased  
frequency of trading. As PS0, the expected number of trades tends to infinity.5Figure 19.1 A stop-loss strategy.

a given time interval is infinite.
M19_HULL0654_11_GE_C19.indd   419 12/05/2021   17:56420 CHAPTER 19
A stop-loss strategy, although superficially attractive, does not work particularly well 
as a hedging procedure. Consider its use for an out-of-the-money option. If the stock 
price never reaches the strike price K , the hedging procedure costs nothing. If the path of  
the stock price crosses the strike price level many times, the procedure is quite expensive. Monte Carlo simulation can be used to assess the overall performance of stop-loss hedging. This involves randomly sampling paths for the stock price and observing the results of using the procedure. Table 19.1 shows the results for the option considered in Section 19.1. It assumes that the stock price is observed at the end of time intervals of 
length 
∆t.6 The hedge performance measure in Table 19.1 is the ratio of the standard 
deviation of the cost of hedging the option to the Black–Scholes–Merton price. (The cost of hedging was calculated as the cumulative cost excluding the impact of interest payments and discounting.) Each result is based on one million sample paths for the stock price. An effective hedging scheme should have a hedge performance measure close to zero. In this case, it seems to stay above 0.7 regardless of how small 
∆t is. This 
emphasizes that the stop-loss strategy is not a good hedging procedure.∆t (weeks) 5 4 2 1 0.5 0.25

6 The precise hedging rule used was as follows. If the stock price moves from below K to above K in a time 
interval of length ∆t, it is bought at the end of the interval. If it moves from above K to below K in the time 
interval, it is sold at the end of the interval; otherwise, no action is taken.19.3 GREEK LETTER CALCULATION
Most traders use more sophisticated hedging procedures than those mentioned so far. These hedging procedures involve calculating measures such as delta, gamma, and vega.  
The measures are collectively referred to as Greek letters. They quantify different aspects of the risk in an option position. This chapter considers the properties of some of most important Greek letters.
In order to calculate a Greek letter, it is necessary to assume an option pricing 
model. Traders usually assume the Black–Scholes–Merton model (or its extensions in  
Chapters 17 and 18) for European options and the binomial tree model (introduced in Chapter 13) for American options. (As has been pointed out, the latter makes the same assumptions as Black–Scholes–Merton model.) When calculating Greek letters, traders normally set the volatility equal to the current implied volatility. This approach, which is sometimes referred to as using the “practitioner Black–Scholes model,” is appealing. When volatility is set equal to the implied volatility, the model gives the option price at a particular time as an exact function of the price of the underlying asset, the implied volatility, interest rates, and (possibly) dividends. The only way the option price can change in a short time period is if one of these variables changes. A trader naturally feels confident if the risks of changes in all these variables have been adequately hedged.
M19_HULL0654_11_GE_C19.indd   420 12/05/2021   17:56The Greek Letters 421
The delta 1∆2 of an option was introduced in Chapter 13. It is defined as the rate of 
change of the option price with respect to the price of the underlying asset. It is the 
slope of the curve that relates the option price to the underlying asset price. Suppose that the delta of a call option on a stock is 0.6. This means that when the stock price changes by a small amount, the option price changes by about 60% of that amount. Figure 19.2 shows the relationship between a call price and the underlying stock price. 
When the stock price corresponds to point A, the option price corresponds to point B, and 
∆ is the slope of the line indicated. In general,
∆=0c
0S
where c is the price of the call option and S is the stock price.
Suppose that, in Figure 19.2, the stock price is $100 and the option price is $10. 
 Imagine an investor who has sold call options to buy 2,000 shares of a stock. The 
 investor’s position could be hedged by buying 0.6*2,000=1,200 shares. The gain 
(loss) on the stock position would then tend to offset the loss (gain) on the option 
 position. For example, if the stock price goes up by $1 (producing a gain of $1,200 on  
the shares purchased), the option price will tend to go up by 0.6*+1=+0.60 
(producing a loss of $1,200 on the options written); if the stock price goes down by  
$1 (producing a loss of $1,200 on the shares purchased), the option price will tend to go 
down by $0.60 (producing a gain of $1,200 on the options written).
In this example, the delta of the trader’s short position in 2,000 options is
0.6*1-2,0002=-1,200
This means that the trader loses 1,200∆S on the option position when the stock price In this chapter, we first consider the calculation of Greek letters for a European option 
on a non-dividend-paying stock. We then present results for other European options. Chapter 21 will show how Greek letters can be calculated for American-style options.

increases by ∆S. The delta of one share of the stock is 1.0, so that the long position in  
1,200 shares has a delta of +1,200. The delta of the trader’s overall position in our 
example is, therefore, zero. The delta of the stock position offsets the delta of the option position. A position with a delta of zero is referred to as delta neutral.
It is important to realize that, since the delta of an option does not remain constant, 
the trader’s position remains delta hedged (or delta neutral) for only a relatively short period of time. The hedge has to be adjusted periodically. This is known as rebalancing. In our example, by the end of 1 day the stock price might have increased to $110. As indicated by Figure 19.2, an increase in the stock price leads to an increase in delta. Suppose that delta rises from 0.60 to 0.65. An extra 
0.05*2,000=100 shares would 
then have to be purchased to maintain the hedge. A procedure such as this, where the  
hedge is adjusted on a regular basis, is referred to as dynamic hedging. It can be  contrasted with static hedging, where a hedge is set up initially and never adjusted. 
Static hedging is sometimes also referred to as “hedge-and-forget.”
Delta is closely related to the Black–Scholes–Merton analysis. As explained in 
Chapter 15, the Black–Scholes–Merton differential equation can be derived by setting up a riskless portfolio consisting of a position in an option on a stock and a position in the stock. Expressed in terms of 
∆, the portfolio is
-1: option
+¢: shares of the stock.
Using our new terminology, we can say that options can be valued by setting up a delta- neutral position and arguing that the return on the position should (instantaneously) be the risk-free interest rate.
Delta of European Stock Options
For a European call option on a non-dividend-paying stock, it can be shown (see  Problem 15.15) that the Black–Scholes–Merton model gives

where d1 is defined as in equation (15.20) and N1x2 is the cumulative distribution 
 function for a standard normal distribution. The formula gives the delta of a long 
 position in one call option. The delta of a short position in one call option is -N1d12. 
Using delta hedging for a short position in a European call option involves maintaining 
a long position of N1d12 for each option sold. Similarly, using delta hedging for a long 
position in a European call option involves maintaining a short position of N1d12 shares 
for each option purchased.
For a European put option on a non-dividend-paying stock, delta is given by
∆1put2=N1d12-1
Delta is negative, which means that a long position in a put option should be hedged with a long position in the underlying stock, and a short position in a put option should be hedged with a short position in the underlying stock. Figure 19.3 shows the variation of the delta of a call option and a put option with the stock price. Figure 19.4 shows the variation of delta with the time to maturity for in-the-money, at-the-money, and out-of-the-money call options.
Example 19.1
Consider again the call option on a non-dividend-paying stock in Section 19. 1 
where the stock price is $49, the strike price is $50, the risk-free rate is 5%, the

Dynamic Aspects of Delta Hedging
Tables 19.2 and 19.3 provide two examples of the operation of delta hedging for the 
example in Section 19.1, where 100,000 call options are sold. The hedge is assumed to 
be adjusted or rebalanced weekly and the assumptions underlying the Black–Scholes– 
Merton model are assumed to hold with the volatility staying constant at 20%. The initial value of delta for a single option is calculated in Example 19.1 as 0.522. This 
means that the delta of the option position is initially 
-100,000*0.522, or -52,200. As  
soon as the option is written, $2,557,800 must be borrowed to buy 52,200 shares at a price of $49 to create a delta-neutral position. The rate of interest is 5%. An interest cost of approximately $2,500 is therefore incurred in the first week.
In Table 19.2, the stock price falls by the end of the first week to $48.12. The delta of 
the option declines to 0.458, so that the new delta of the option position is 
-45,800. This 
means that 6,400 of the shares initially purchased are sold to maintain the delta-neutral hedge. The strategy realizes $308,000 in cash, and the cumulative borrowings at the end  
of Week 1 are reduced to $2,252,300. During the second week, the stock price reduces to  
$47.37, delta declines again, and so on. Toward the end of the life of the option, it becomes apparent that the option will be exercised and the delta of the option approaches 1.0. By Week 20, therefore, the hedger has a fully covered position. The

hedger receives $5 million for the stock held, so that the total cost of writing the option 
and hedging it is $263,300.
Table 19.3 illustrates an alternative sequence of events such that the option closes out 
of the money. As it becomes clear that the option will not be exercised, delta approaches zero. By Week 20 the hedger has a naked position and has incurred costs totaling $256,600.
In Tables 19.2 and 19.3, the costs of hedging the option, when discounted to the 
beginning of the period, are close to but not exactly the same as the Black–Scholes– Merton price of $240,000. If the hedging worked perfectly, the cost of hedging would, after discounting, be exactly equal to the Black–Scholes–Merton price for every simu-lated stock price path. The reason for the variation in the hedging cost is that the hedge is rebalanced only once a week. As rebalancing takes place more frequently, the variation in the hedging cost is reduced. Of course, the examples in Tables 19.2 and 19.3 are idealized 
in that they assume that the volatility is constant and there are no transaction costs.
Table 19.4 shows statistics on the performance of delta hedging obtained from one 
million random stock price paths in our example. The performance measure is calculated, similarly to Table 19.1, as the ratio of the standard deviation of the cost of hedging the 
option to the Black–Scholes–Merton price of the option. It is clear that delta hedging is a  Week Stock

great improvement over a stop-loss strategy. Unlike a stop-loss strategy, the performance 
of delta-hedging gets steadily better as the hedge is monitored more frequently.
Delta hedging aims to keep the value of the financial institution’s position as close to  
unchanged as possible. Initially, the value of the written option is $240,000. In the  situation depicted in Table 19.2, the value of the option can be calculated as $414,500 in 
Week 9. (This value is obtained from the Black–Scholes–Merton model by setting the stock price equal to $53 and the time to maturity equal to 11 weeks.) Thus, the financial institution has lost $174,500 on its short option position. Its cash position, as measured by the cumulative cost, is $1,442,900 worse in Week 9 than in Week 0. The value of the shares held has increased from $2,557,800 to $4,171,100. The net effect of all this is that the value of the financial institution’s position has changed by only $4,100 between Week 0 and Week 9.
Where the Cost Comes From
The delta-hedging procedure in Tables 19.2 and 19.3 creates the equivalent of a long position in the option. This neutralizes the short position the financial institution  created by writing the option. As the tables illustrate, delta hedging a short position 
generally involves selling stock just after the price has gone down and buying stock just after the price has gone up. It might be termed a buy-high, sell-low trading strategy! The average cost of $240,000 comes from the present value of the difference between the price at which stock is purchased and the price at which it is sold.
Delta of a Portfolio
The delta of a portfolio of options or other derivatives dependent on a single asset whose price is S is
0Π
0S
where ∑ is the value of the portfolio.
The delta of the portfolio can be calculated from the deltas of the individual options 
in the portfolio. If a portfolio consists of a quantity wi of option i 11…i…n2, the delta 
of the portfolio is given by
∆=an
i=1wi ∆i
where ∆i is the delta of the i th option. The formula can be used to calculate the 
 position in the underlying asset necessary to make the delta of the portfolio zero. When 
this position has been taken, the portfolio is delta neutral.Time between hedge

Suppose a financial institution has the following three positions in options on a 
stock:
1. A long position in 100,000 call options with strike price $55 and an expiration date 
in 3 months. The delta of each option is 0.533.
2. A short position in 200,000 call options with strike price $56 and an expiration 
date in 5 months. The delta of each option is 0.468.
3. A short position in 50,000 put options with strike price $56 and an expiration date 
in 2 months. The delta of each option is -0.508.
The delta of the whole portfolio is
100,000*0.533-200,000*0.468-50,000*1-0.5082=-14,900
This means that the portfolio can be made delta neutral by buying 14,900 shares.
Transaction Costs
Derivatives dealers usually rebalance their positions once a day to maintain delta  neutrality. When the dealer has a small number of options on a particular asset, this is 
liable to be prohibitively expensive because of the bid–ask spreads the dealer is subject to  
on trades. For a large portfolio of options, it is more feasible. Only one trade in the underlying asset is necessary to zero out delta for the whole portfolio. The bid–ask spread transaction costs are absorbed by the profits on many different trades.
19.5 THETA
The theta 1Θ2 of a portfolio of options is the rate of change of the value of the portfolio 
with respect to the passage of time with all else remaining the same. Theta is sometimes  
referred to as the time decay of the portfolio. For a European call option on a non- dividend-paying stock, it can be shown from the Black–Scholes–Merton formula (see Problem 15.15) that
Θ1call2=-S0N′1d 12s
22T-rKe-rT N1d22
where d1 and d2 are defined as in equation (15.20) and
 N′1x2=1
22p e-x2>2 (19.2)
is the probability density function for a standard normal distribution.
For a European put option on the stock,
Θ1put2=-S0N′1d 12s
22T+rKe-rT N1-d22
Because N1-d22=1-N1d22, the theta of a put exceeds the theta of the corresponding 
call by rKe-rT.
In these formulas, time is measured in years. Usually, when theta is quoted, time is 
measured in days, so that theta is the change in the portfolio value when 1 day passes 
M19_HULL0654_11_GE_C19.indd   427 12/05/2021   17:56428 CHAPTER 19
with all else remaining the same. We can measure theta either “per calendar day” or 
“per trading day.” To obtain the theta per calendar day, the formula for theta must be divided by 365; to obtain theta per trading day, it must be divided by 252. (DerivaGem measures theta per calendar day.)
Example 19.2
As in Example 19. 1, consider a call option on a non-dividend-paying stock where 
the stock price is $49, the strike price is $50, the risk-free rate is 5%, the time to  
maturity is 20 weeks (= 0.3846 years), and the volatility is 20%. In this case, 
S0=49, K=50, r=0.05, s=0.2, and T=0.3846.
The option’s theta is
-S0N′1d 12s
22T-rKe-rT N1d22=-4.31
The theta is -4.31>365=-0.0118 per calendar day, or -4.31>252=-0.0171 per 
trading day.
Theta is usually negative for an option.7 This is because, as time passes with all else 
remaining the same, the option tends to become less valuable. The variation of ® with 
stock price for a call option on a stock is shown in Figure 19.5. When the stock price is  
very low, theta is close to zero. For an at-the-money call option, theta is large and  negative. As the stock price becomes larger, theta tends to 
-rKe-rT. (In our example,  
r=0.) Figure 19.6 shows typical patterns for the variation of ® with the time to 
 maturity for in-the-money, at-the-money, and out-of-the-money call options.
7 An exception to this could be an in-the-money European put option on a non-dividend-paying stock or an 
in-the-money European call option on a currency with a very high interest rate.Figure 19.5 Variation of theta of a European call option with stock price (K = 50,

Theta is not the same type of hedge parameter as delta. There is uncertainty about 
the future stock price, but there is no uncertainty about the passage of time. It makes 
sense to hedge against changes in the price of the underlying asset, but it does not make any sense to hedge against the passage of time. In spite of this, many traders regard theta as a useful descriptive statistic for a portfolio. This is because, as we shall see later, in a delta-neutral portfolio theta is a proxy for gamma.Figure 19.6 Typical patterns for variation of theta of a European call option with time

19.6 GAMMA
The gamma 1Γ2 of a portfolio of options on an underlying asset is the rate of change of 
the portfolio’s delta with respect to the price of the underlying asset. It is the second partial derivative of the portfolio with respect to asset price:
Γ=02Π
0S2
If gamma is small, delta changes slowly, and adjustments to keep a portfolio delta neutral need to be made only relatively infrequently. However, if gamma is highly negative or highly positive, delta is very sensitive to the price of the underlying asset. It is then quite risky to leave a delta-neutral portfolio unchanged for any length of time.  
Figure 19.7 illustrates this point. When the stock price moves from S to 
S′, delta  
hedging assumes that the option price moves from C  to C′, when in fact it moves from 
C to C″. The difference between C′ and C″ leads to a hedging error. The size of the 
error depends on the curvature of the relationship between the option price and the stock price. Gamma measures this curvature.
M19_HULL0654_11_GE_C19.indd   429 12/05/2021   17:56430 CHAPTER 19
Suppose that ∆S is the price change of an underlying asset during a small interval of 
time, ∆t, and ∆Π is the corresponding price change in the portfolio. The appendix at 
the end of this chapter shows that, if terms of order higher than ∆t are ignored,
 ∆Π=Θ∆t+1
2 Γ∆S2 (19.3)
for a delta-neutral portfolio, where Θ is the theta of the portfolio. Figure 19.8 shows the 
nature of the relationship between ∆Π and ∆S. When gamma is positive, theta tends to 
be negative. The portfolio declines in value if there is no change in S, but increases in 
value if there is a large positive or negative change in S. When gamma is negative, theta  
tends to be positive and the reverse is true: the portfolio increases in value if there is no 
change in S  but decreases in value if there is a large positive or negative change in S . As 
the absolute value of gamma increases, the sensitivity of the value of the portfolio to S increases.
Example 19.3
Suppose that the gamma of a delta-neutral portfolio of options on an asset is 
-10,000. Equation (19.3) shows that, if a change of +2 or -2 in the price of the 
asset occurs over a short period of time, there is an unexpected decrease in the 
value of the portfolio of approximately 0.5*10,000*22=+20,000.
Making a Portfolio Gamma Neutral
A position in the underlying asset has zero gamma and cannot be used to change the gamma of a portfolio. What is required is a position in an instrument such as an option that is not linearly dependent on the underlying asset.
Suppose that a delta-neutral portfolio has a gamma equal to 
Γ, and a traded option 
has a gamma equal to ΓT. If the number of traded options added to the portfolio is wT, 
the gamma of the portfolio is
wT ΓT+Γ
Hence, the position in the traded option necessary to make the portfolio gamma neutral is 
-Γ>ΓT. Including the traded option is likely to change the delta of the portfolio, so 
the position in the underlying asset then has to be changed to maintain delta neutrality.Figure 19.7 Hedging error introduced by nonlinearity.

Note that the portfolio is gamma neutral only for a short period of time. As time 
passes, gamma neutrality can be maintained only if the position in the traded option is adjusted so that it is always equal to 
-Γ>ΓT.
Making a portfolio gamma neutral as well as delta-neutral can be regarded as a 
correction for the hedging error illustrated in Figure 19.7. Delta neutrality provides protection against relatively small stock price moves between rebalancing. Gamma neutrality provides protection against larger movements in this stock price between  
hedge rebalancing. Suppose that a portfolio is delta neutral and has a gamma of 
-3,000. The delta and gamma of a particular traded call option are 0.62 and 1.50, 
respectively. The portfolio can be made gamma neutral by including in the portfolio a long position of
3,000
1.5=2,000
in the call option. However, the delta of the portfolio will then change from zero to 
2,000*0.62=1,240. Therefore 1,240 units of the underlying asset must be sold from 
the portfolio to keep it delta neutral.Figure 19.8 Relationship between ∆Π and ∆S in time ∆t for a delta-neutral portfolio

Calculation of Gamma
For a European call or put option on a non-dividend-paying stock, the gamma given 
by the Black–Scholes–Merton model is
Γ=N′1d 12
S0s2T
where d1 is defined as in equation (15.20) and N′1x2 is as given by equation (19.2). The 
gamma of a long position is always positive and varies with S0 in the way indicated in  
Figure 19.9. The variation of gamma with time to maturity for out-of-the-money, 
at-the-money, and in-the-money options is shown in Figure 19.10. For an at-the-money option, gamma increases as the time to maturity decreases. Short-life at-the-money options have very high gammas, which means that the value of the option holder’s position is highly sensitive to jumps in the stock price.
Example 19.4
As in Example 19. 1, consider a call option on a non-dividend-paying stock where 
the stock price is $49, the strike price is $50, the risk-free rate is 5%, the time to  
maturity is 20 weeks 
1= 0.3846 years2, and the volatility is 20%. In this case, 
S0=49, K=50, r=0.05, s=0.2, and T=0.3846.
The option’s gamma is
N′1d 12
S0s2T=0.066
When the stock price changes by ∆S, the delta of the option changes by 0.066∆S.

The price of a single derivative dependent on a non-dividend-paying stock that follows 
a geometric Brownian motion process must satisfy the differential equation (15.16). It follows that the value of 
Π of a portfolio of such derivatives also satisfies the differential 
equation

This shows that, when Θ is large and positive, gamma of a portfolio tends to be large

M19_HULL0654_11_GE_C19.indd   433 12/05/2021   17:56434 CHAPTER 19
As mentioned in Section 19.3, when Greek letters are calculated the volatility of the 
asset is in practice usually set equal to its implied volatility. The Black–Scholes–Merton model assumes that the volatility of the asset underlying an option is constant. This means that the implied volatilities of all options on the asset are constant and equal to this assumed volatility.
But in practice the volatility of an asset changes over time. As a result, the value of an  
option is liable to change because of movements in volatility as well as because of changes in the asset price and the passage of time. The vega of an option, 
V, is the rate 
of change in its value with respect to the volatility of the underlying asset:8
V=0f
0s
where f is the option price and the volatility measure, s, is usually the option’s implied 
volatility. When vega is highly positive or highly negative, there is a high sensitivity to changes in volatility. If the vega of an option position is close to zero, volatility changes have very little effect on the value of the position.
A position in the underlying asset has zero vega. Vega cannot therefore be changed 
by taking a position in the underlying asset. In this respect, vega is like gamma.  
A complication is that different options in a portfolio are liable to have different implied volatilities. If all implied volatilities are assumed to change by the same amount during any short period of time, vega can be treated like gamma and the vega risk in a  
portfolio of options can be hedged by taking a position in a single option. If 
V is the 
vega of a portfolio and VT is the vega of a traded option, a position of -V>VT in the  
traded option makes the portfolio instantaneously vega neutral. Unfortunately, a  portfolio that is gamma neutral will not in general be vega neutral, and vice versa. If 
a hedger requires a portfolio to be both gamma and vega neutral, at least two traded options dependent on the underlying asset must be used.
Example 19.5
Consider a portfolio that is delta neutral, with a gamma of 
-5,000 and a vega 
(measuring sensitivity to implied volatility) of -8,000. The options shown in the 
following table can be traded. The portfolio can be made vega neutral by including 
a long position in 4,000 of Option 1. This would increase delta to 2,400 and require that 2,400 units of the asset be sold to maintain delta neutrality. The gamma of the portfolio would change from 
-5,000 to -3,000.
Delta Gamma Vega
Portfolio 0 -5000 -8000
Option 1 0.6 0.5 2.0
Option 2 0.5 0.8 1.2
To make the portfolio gamma and vega neutral, both Option 1 and Option 2 
can be used. If w1 and w2 are the quantities of Option 1 and Option 2 that are 19.8 VEGA
8 Vega is the name given to one of the “Greek letters” in option pricing, but it is not one of the letters in the 
Greek alphabet.
M19_HULL0654_11_GE_C19.indd   434 12/05/2021   17:56The Greek Letters 435
added to the portfolio, we require that
-5,000+0.5w1+0.8w2=0
and
-8,000+2.0w1+1.2w2=0
The solution to these equations is w1=400, w2=6,000. The portfolio can there-
fore be made gamma and vega neutral by including 400 of Option 1 and 6,000 of 
Option 2. The delta of the portfolio, after the addition of the positions in the two traded options, is 
400*0.6+6,000*0.5=3,240. Hence, 3,240 units of the asset 
would have to be sold to maintain delta neutrality.
Hedging in the way indicated in Example 19.5 assumes that the implied volatilities of all options in a portfolio will change by the same amount during a short period of time. In practice, this is not necessarily true and a trader’s hedging problem is more complex. As  
we will see in the next chapter, for any given underlying asset a trader monitors a  “volatility surface” that describes the implied volatilities of options with different strike 
prices and times to maturity. The trader’s total vega risk for a portfolio is related to the different ways in which the volatility surface can change.
For a European call or put option on a non-dividend-paying stock, vega given by the 
Black–Scholes–Merton model is
V=S02T N′1d 12
where d1 is defined as in equation (15.20). The formula for N′1x2 is given in equa-
tion (19.2). The vega of a long position in a European or American option is always positive. The general way in which vega varies with 
S0 is shown in Figure 19.11.

Example 19.6
As in Example 19. 1, consider a call option on a non-dividend-paying stock where 
the stock price is $49, the strike price is $50, the risk-free rate is 5%, the time to 
maturity is 20 weeks (= 0.3846 years), and the implied volatility is 20%. In this case, 
S0=49, K=50, r=0.05, s=0.2, and T=0.3846.
The option’s vega is
S02T N′1d 12=12.1
Thus a 1% (0.01) increase in the implied volatility from (20% to 21%) increases the value of the option by approximately 
0.01*12.1=0.121.
Calculating vega from the Black–Scholes–Merton model and its extensions may seem strange because one of the assumptions underlying the model is that volatility is  constant. It would be theoretically more correct to calculate vega from a model in which 
volatility is assumed to be stochastic.
9 However, traders prefer the simpler approach of 
measuring vega in terms of potential movements in the Black–Scholes–Merton implied volatility.
Gamma neutrality protects against large changes in the price of the underlying asset 
between hedge rebalancing. Vega neutrality protects against changes in volatility. As might be expected, whether it is best to use an available traded option for vega or gamma hedging depends on the time between hedge rebalancing and the volatility of the volatility.
10
When volatilities change, the implied volatilities of short-dated options tend to change 
by more than the implied volatilities of long-dated options. The vega of a portfolio is therefore often calculated by changing the volatilities of long-dated options by less than that of short-dated options. One way of doing this is discussed in Section 23.6.
9 See Chapter 27 for a discussion of stochastic volatility models.
10 For a discussion of this issue, see J. C. Hull and A. White, “Hedging the Risks from Writing Foreign 
 Currency Options, ” Journal of International Money and Finance 6 (June 1987): 131 –52.19.9 RHO
The rho of an option is the rate of change of its price f  with respect to the interest 
rate r:
0f
0r
It measures the sensitivity of the value of a portfolio to a change in the interest rate when all else remains the same. In practice (at least for European options) r  is usually set equal 
to the risk-free rate for a maturity equal to the option’s maturity (see Section 28.6). This means that a trader has exposure to movements in the whole term structure when the options in the trader’s portfolio have different maturities. For a European call option on a non-dividend-paying stock,
rho 1call2=KTe-rT N1d22

Example 19.7
As in Example 19. 1, consider a call option on a non-dividend-paying stock where 
the stock price is $49, the strike price is $50, the risk-free rate is 5%, the time to  
maturity is 20 weeks (= 0.3846 years), and the volatility is 20%. In this case, 
S0=49, K=50, r=0.05, s=0.2, and T=0.3846.
The option’s rho is
KTe-rT N1d22=8.91
This means that a 1% (0.01) increase in the risk-free rate (from 5% to 6%) 
increases the value of the option by approximately 0.01*8.91=0.0891.
11 The trading costs arise from the fact that each day the hedger buys some of the underlying asset at the ask 
price or sells some of the underlying asset at the bid price.19.10   THE REALITIES OF HEDGING
In an ideal world, traders working for financial institutions would be able to  rebalance 
their portfolios very frequently in order to maintain all Greeks equal to zero. In  
practice, this is not possible. When managing a large portfolio dependent on a single 
underlying asset, traders usually make delta zero, or close to zero, at least once a day by trading the underlying asset. Unfortunately, a zero gamma and a zero vega are less easy to achieve because it is difficult to find options or other nonlinear derivatives that can be traded in the volume required at competitive prices. Business Snapshot 19.1 provides a discussion of how dynamic hedging is organized at financial institutions.
As already mentioned, there are big economies of scale in trading derivatives. 
 Maintaining delta neutrality for a small number of options on an asset by trading 
daily is usually not economically feasible because the trading costs per option hedged are high.
11 But when a derivatives dealer maintains delta neutrality for a large portfolio 
of options on an asset, the trading costs per option hedged are more reasonable.
19.11   SCENARIO ANALYSIS
In addition to monitoring risks such as delta, gamma, and vega, option traders often also carry out a scenario analysis. The analysis involves calculating the gain or loss on their portfolio over a specified period under a variety of different scenarios. The time period chosen is likely to depend on the liquidity of the instruments. The scenarios can be either chosen by management or generated by a model.
Consider a bank with a portfolio of options dependent on the USD/EUR exchange 
rate. The two key variables on which the value of the portfolio depends are the exchange rate and the exchange rate volatility. The bank could calculate a table such as Table 19.5 showing the profit or loss experienced during a 2-week period under different scenarios. This table considers seven different exchange rate movements and three different implied volatility movements. The table makes the simplifying assump-tion that the implied volatilities of all options in the portfolio change by the same amount. (Note: + 2% would indicate a volatility change from 10% to 12%, not 10% 
to 10.2%.)
M19_HULL0654_11_GE_C19.indd   437 12/05/2021   17:56438 CHAPTER 19
In Table 19.5, the greatest loss is in the lower right corner of the table. The loss 
 corresponds to implied volatilities increasing by 2% and the exchange rate moving up  
by 0.06. Usually the greatest loss in a table such as Table 19.5 occurs at one of the 
corners, but this is not always so. Consider, for example, the situation where a bank’s  
portfolio consists of a short position in a butterfly spread (see Section 12.3). The  greatest loss will be experienced if the exchange rate stays where it is.Business Snapshot 19.1 Dynamic Hedging in Practice
In a typical arrangement at a financial institution, the responsibility for a portfolio of 
derivatives dependent on a particular underlying asset is assigned to one trader or to  
a group of traders working together. For example, one trader at Goldman Sachs might be assigned responsibility for all derivatives dependent on the value of the Australian dollar. A computer system calculates the value of the portfolio and Greek  
letters for the portfolio. Limits are defined for each Greek letter and special  permission is required if a trader wants to exceed a limit at the end of a trading day.
The delta limit is often expressed as the equivalent maximum position in the 
underlying asset. For example, the delta limit for a stock at a particular bank might 
be $1 million. If the stock price is $50, this means that the absolute value of delta as we have calculated it can be no more than 20,000. The vega limit is usually expressed as a maximum dollar exposure per 1% change in implied volatilities.
As a matter of course, options traders make themselves delta neutral—or close to 
delta neutral—at the end of each day. Gamma and vega are monitored, but are not usually managed on a daily basis. Financial institutions often find that their business with clients involves writing options and that as a result they accumulate negative gamma and vega. They are then always looking out for opportunities to manage their gamma and vega risks by buying options at competitive prices.
There is one aspect of an options portfolio that mitigates problems of  managing 
gamma and vega somewhat. Options are often close to the money when they are first sold, so that they have relatively high gammas and vegas. But after some time  
has elapsed, the underlying asset price has often changed enough for them to become deep out of the money or deep in the money. Their gammas and vegas are then very small and of little consequence. A nightmare scenario for an options trader is where written options remain very close to the money as the maturity date is approached.

The formulas produced so far for delta, theta, gamma, vega, and rho have been for a 
European option on a non-dividend-paying stock. Table 19.6 shows how they change when the stock pays a continuous dividend yield at rate q . The expressions for 
d1 and d2  
are as for equations (17.4) and (17.5). By setting q  equal to the dividend yield on an index, 
we obtain the Greek letters for European options on indices. By setting q  equal to the 
foreign risk-free rate, we obtain the Greek letters for European options on a currency. By setting 
q=r, we obtain delta, gamma, theta, and vega for European options on a futures 
contract. The rho for a call futures option is -cT and the rho for a European put futures 
option is -pT.
In the case of currency options, there are two rhos corresponding to the two  interest 
rates. The rho corresponding to the domestic interest rate is given by the formula in  
Table 19.6 (with d2 as in equation (17.11)). The rho corresponding to the foreign 
 interest rate for a European call on a currency is
rho1call, foreign rate2=-Te-rfT S0N1d12
For a European put, it is
rho1put, foreign rate2=Te-rf T S0N1-d12
with d1 as in equation (17.11).
The calculation of Greek letters for American options is discussed in Chapter 21.
Delta of Forward Contracts
The concept of delta can be applied to financial instruments other than options.  Consider 
a forward contract on a non-dividend-paying stock. Equation (5.5) shows that the value 
of a forward contract is S0-Ke-rT, where K is the delivery price and T is the forward 
contract’s time to maturity. When the price of the stock changes by ∆S, with all else 
remaining the same, the value of a forward contract on the stock also changes by ∆S. The

delta of a long forward contract on one share of the stock is therefore always 1.0. This 
means that a long forward contract on one share can be hedged by shorting one share; a  
short forward contract on one share can be hedged by purchasing one share.12
For an asset providing a dividend yield at rate q, equation (5.7) shows that the 
 forward contract’s delta is e-qT. For the delta of a forward contract on a stock index, q  
is set equal to the dividend yield on the index in this expression. For the delta of a 
 forward foreign exchange contract, it is set equal to the foreign risk-free rate, rf.
Delta of a Futures Contract
From equation (5.1), the futures price for a contract on a non-dividend-paying stock is 
S0erT, where T is the time to maturity of the futures contract. This shows that when the 
price of the stock changes by ∆S, with all else remaining the same, the futures price 
changes by ∆S erT. Since futures contracts are settled daily, the holder of a long futures  
position makes an almost immediate gain of this amount. The delta of a futures 
 contract is therefore erT. For a futures position on an asset providing a dividend yield 
at rate q, equation (5.3) shows similarly that delta is e1r-q2T.
It is interesting that daily settlement makes the deltas of futures and forward contracts 
slightly different. This is true even when interest rates are constant and the forward price equals the futures price. (A related point is made in Business Snapshot 5.2.)
Sometimes a futures contract is used to achieve a delta-neutral position. Define:
T : Maturity of futures contract
H
A: Required position in asset for delta hedging
HF : Alternative required position in futures contracts for delta hedging.
If the underlying asset is a non-dividend-paying stock, the analysis we have just given shows that
 
HF=e-rT HA (19.5)
When the underlying asset pays a dividend yield q, 
HF=e-1r-q2T HA (19.6)
For a stock index, we set q equal to the dividend yield on the index; for a currency, we 
set it equal to the foreign risk-free rate, r f , so that
 HF=e-1r-rf2T HA (19.7)
Example 19.8
Suppose that a portfolio of currency options held by a U.S. bank can be made delta neutral with a short position of 458,000 pounds sterling. Risk-free rates are 4% in the United States and 7% in the United Kingdom. From equation (19.7), hedging using 9-month currency futures requires a short futures position
e-10.04-0.072*9>12*458,000
or £468,442. Since each futures contract is for the purchase or sale of £62,500, seven contracts would be shorted. (Seven is the nearest whole number to 468,442/62,500.)
12 These are hedge-and-forget schemes. Since delta is always 1.0, no changes need to be made to the position 
in the stock during the life of the contract.

A portfolio manager is often interested in acquiring a put option on his or her portfolio. 
This provides protection against market declines while preserving the potential for a gain if the market does well. One approach (discussed in Section 17.1) is to buy put options on a market index such as the S&P 500. An alternative is to create the options synthetically.
Creating an option synthetically involves maintaining a position in the underlying 
asset (or futures on the underlying asset) so that the delta of the position is equal to the delta of the required option. The position necessary to create an option synthetically is the reverse of that necessary to hedge it. This is because the procedure for hedging an option involves the creation of an equal and opposite option synthetically.
There are two reasons why it may be more attractive for the portfolio manager to 
create the required put option synthetically than to buy it in the market. First, option markets do not always have the liquidity to absorb the trades required by managers of large funds. Second, fund managers often require strike prices and exercise dates that are different from those available in exchange-traded options markets.
The synthetic option can be created from trading the portfolio or from trading in 
index futures contracts. We first examine the creation of a put option by trading the portfolio. From Table 19.6, the delta of a European put on the portfolio is
 
∆=e-qT 3N1d12-14 (19.8)
where, with our usual notation,
d1=ln1S0>K2+1r-q+s2>22T
s2T
The other variables are defined as usual: S0 is the value of the portfolio, K is the strike 
price, r is the risk-free rate, q is the dividend yield on the portfolio, s is the volatility of 
the portfolio, and T is the life of the option. The volatility of the portfolio can usually 
be assumed to be its beta times the volatility of a well-diversified market index.
To create the put option synthetically, the fund manager should ensure that at any 
given time a proportion
e-qT 31-N1d124
of the stocks in the original portfolio has been sold and the proceeds invested in riskless  
assets. As the value of the original portfolio declines, the delta of the put given by 
 equation (19.8) becomes more negative and the proportion of the original portfolio sold 
must be increased. As the value of the original portfolio increases, the delta of the put  
becomes less negative and the proportion of the original portfolio sold must be decreased (i.e., some of the original portfolio must be repurchased).
Using this strategy to create portfolio insurance means that at any given time funds 
are divided between the stock portfolio on which insurance is required and riskless assets. As the value of the stock portfolio increases, riskless assets are sold and the position in the stock portfolio is increased. As the value of the stock portfolio declines, the position in the stock portfolio is decreased and riskless assets are purchased. The cost of the insurance arises from the fact that the portfolio manager is always selling after a decline in the market and buying after a rise in the market.19.13   PORTFOLIO INSURANCE
M19_HULL0654_11_GE_C19.indd   441 12/05/2021   17:56442 CHAPTER 19
Example 19.9
A portfolio is worth $90 million. To protect against market downturns the man-
agers of the portfolio require a 6-month European put option on the portfolio with a strike price of $87 million. The risk-free rate is 9% per annum, the dividend yield is 3% per annum, and the volatility of the portfolio is estimated as 25% per annum. A stock index stands at 900. The portfolio is considered to mimic the index fairly closely. One alternative, discussed in Section 17.1, is to buy 1,000 put option contracts on the index with a strike price of 870. Another  alternative is to create 
the required option synthetically. In this case, S
0 = 90 million, K = 87 million,  
r = 0.09, q = 0.03, σ = 0.25, and T = 0.5, so that
d1=ln190>872+10.09-0.03+0.252>220.5
0.2520.5=0.4499
and the delta of the required option is
e-qT 3N1d12-14=-0.3215
This shows that 32.15% of the portfolio should be sold initially and invested in  
risk-free assets to match the delta of the required option. The amount of the  
 portfolio sold must be monitored frequently. For example, if the value of the 
 original portfolio reduces to $88 million after 1 day, the delta of the required 
option changes to 0.3679 and a further 4.64% of the original portfolio should be  
sold and invested in risk-free assets. If the value of the portfolio increases  
to $92 million, the delta of the required option changes to -0.2787 and 4.28% 
of the original portfolio should be repurchased.
Use of Index Futures
Using index futures to create options synthetically can be preferable to using the  underlying stocks because the transaction costs associated with trades in index futures 
are generally lower than those associated with the corresponding trades in the under-lying stocks. The dollar amount of the futures contracts shorted as a proportion of the value of the portfolio should from equations (19.6) and (19.8) be
e-qT e-1r-q2T* 31-N1d124=eq1T*-T2e-rT* 31-N1d124
where T* is the maturity of the futures contract. If the portfolio is worth A1 times the 
index and each index futures contract is on A2 times the index, the number of futures 
contracts shorted at any given time should be
eq1T*-T2e-rT* 31-N1d124 A1>A2
Example 19.10
Suppose in Example 19. 9 futures contracts on the index maturing in 9 months  
are used to create the option synthetically. In this case initially T = 0.5, T* = 0.75, 
A1 = 100,000, and d1=0.4499. Each index futures contract is on 250 times the 
index, so that A2=250. The number of futures contracts shorted should be
eq1T*-T2e-rT* 31-N1d124 A1>A2=122.96
or 123, rounding to the nearest whole number. As time passes and the index changes, the position in futures contracts must be adjusted.
M19_HULL0654_11_GE_C19.indd   442 12/05/2021   17:56The Greek Letters 443
This analysis assumes that the portfolio mirrors the index. When this is not the case, it 
is necessary to (a) calculate the portfolio’s beta, (b) find the position in options on the index that gives the required protection, and (c) choose a position in index futures to create the options synthetically. As discussed in Section 17.1, the strike price for the options should be the expected level of the market index when the portfolio reaches its insured value. The number of options required is beta times the number that would be required if the portfolio had a beta of 1.0.
Impact on Volatility
We discussed in Chapter 15 the issue of whether volatility is caused solely by the arrival of new information or whether trading itself generates volatility. Portfolio insurance strategies such as those just described have the potential to increase volatility. When the  
market declines, they cause portfolio managers either to sell stock or to sell index futures contracts. Either action may accentuate the decline (see Business Snapshot 19.2).  
The sale of stock is liable to drive down the market index further in a direct way. The sale of index futures contracts is liable to drive down futures prices. This creates selling pressure on stocks via the mechanism of index arbitrage (see Chapter 5), so that the market index is liable to be driven down in this case as well. Similarly, when the market rises, the portfolio insurance strategies cause portfolio managers either to buy stock or to buy futures contracts. This may accentuate the rise.
In addition to formal portfolio trading strategies, we can speculate that many investors 
consciously or subconsciously follow portfolio insurance rules of their own. For example, an investor may choose to sell when the market is falling to limit the downside risk.
Whether portfolio insurance trading strategies (formal or informal) affect volatility 
depends on how easily the market can absorb the trades that are generated by portfolio insurance. If portfolio insurance trades are a very small fraction of all trades, there is likely to be no effect. But if portfolio insurance becomes very popular, it is liable to have a destabilizing effect on the market, as it did in 1987.
13 See, for example, J. Cao, J. Chen, J. Hull, and Z. Poulos, “Deep Hedging of Derivatives Using 
 Reinforcement Learning” (2019), SSRN 3514586; H. Buehler, L. Gonon, J. Teichmann, B. Wood, “Deep 
Hedging, ” Quantitative Finance , 19, 8 (2019); and P . N. Kolm and G. Ritter, “Dynamic Replication and 
Hedging: A Reinforcement Learning Approach, ” Journal of Financial Data Science, 1 (Winter 2019): 159–171.19.14   APPLICATION OF MACHINE LEARNING TO HEDGING
Hedging a position in derivatives involves a sequence of decisions. An initial hedge is 
chosen and, as the price of the underlying asset changes, further decisions have to be made at later points in time. If there are no transaction costs or other trading frictions, it is optimal to take positions that make the Greek letters equal to zero. But, if there are non-negligible costs associated with trading, the hedger will want to take these into account when developing a hedging strategy.
Reinforcement learning is the machine learning tool that is used for sequential 
 decision problems. It has been employed to develop software that can play games such  
as chess and Go better than any human being, and has recently be applied to the 
 problem of hedging derivatives positions when there are transaction/trading costs.
13 
Reinforcement learning involves specifying an objective function and using a systematic  
M19_HULL0654_11_GE_C19.indd   443 12/05/2021   17:56444 CHAPTER 19
“trial and error” approach to determine the best strategy. It requires a great deal of data 
representing different ways the future might unfold. In the case of the hedging decision, a stochastic process can be assumed for the underlying asset’s price and the required data can be generated using Monte Carlo simulation.
The hedger is faced with a trade-off between (a) the expected cost of hedging and  
(b) the riskiness of the portfolio. Risks can be reduced, but only by incurring transaction/trading costs. An objective could be to minimize 
X+cY, where X is the expected cost of  
hedging, Y is the standard deviation of the profit/loss from the hedged portfolio, and c is 
a constant reflecting the trade-off. Many possible paths for the price of the underlying asset are simulated. The reinforcement algorithm uses the paths to learn the hedging strategy that gives an optimal value for the specified objective function.
SUMMARY
Financial institutions offer a variety of option products to their clients. Often the options do not correspond to the standardized products traded by exchanges. The financial institutions are then faced with the problem of hedging their exposure. Naked and covered positions leave them subject to an unacceptable level of risk. One course of action that is sometimes proposed is a stop-loss strategy. This involves holding a naked position when an option is out of the money and converting it to a covered position as soon as the option moves into the money. Although superficially attractive, the strategy does not provide a good hedge.Business Snapshot 19.2 Was Portfolio Insurance to Blame for the 1987 Crash?
On Monday, October 19, 1987 , the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by more than 20%. Many people feel that portfolio insurance played a major role in this crash. In October 1987 between $60 billion and $90 billion of equity assets were subject to portfolio insurance trading rules where put options were created synthetically in the  
way discussed in Section 19. 13. During the period Wednesday, October 14, 1987, to  
 Friday, October 16, 1987 , the market declined by about 10%, with much of this 
decline taking place on Friday afternoon. The portfolio trading rules should have generated at least $12 billion of equity or index futures sales as a result of this decline. In fact, portfolio insurers had time to sell only $4 billion and they approached the  
following week with huge amounts of selling already dictated by their models. It is  
 estimated that on Monday, October 19, sell programs by three portfolio insurers 
accounted for almost 10% of the sales on the New York Stock Exchange, and that portfolio insurance sales amounted to 21.3% of all sales in index futures markets. It is likely that the decline in equity prices was exacerbated by investors other than portfolio insurers selling heavily because they anticipated the actions of portfolio insurers.
Because the market declined so fast and the stock exchange systems were over-
loaded, many portfolio insurers were unable to execute the trades generated by their  
models and failed to obtain the protection they required. Needless to say, the  popularity of portfolio insurance schemes has declined significantly since 1987. 
One of the morals of this story is that it is dangerous to follow a particular  trading 
 strategy—even a hedging strategy—when many other market participants are doing 
the same thing.
M19_HULL0654_11_GE_C19.indd   444 12/05/2021   17:56The Greek Letters 445
The delta 1∆2 of an option is the rate of change of its price with respect to the price of 
the underlying asset. Delta hedging involves creating a position with zero delta (some-
times referred to as a delta-neutral position). Because the delta of the underlying asset is 1.0, one way of hedging is to take a position of 
-∆ in the underlying asset for each 
long option being hedged. The delta of an option changes over time. This means that the position in the underlying asset has to be frequently adjusted.
Once an option position has been made delta neutral, the next stage is often to look 
at its gamma 
1Γ2. The gamma of an option is the rate of change of its delta with respect 
to the price of the underlying asset. It is a measure of the curvature of the relationship  
between the option price and the asset price. The impact of this curvature on the 
 performance of delta hedging can be reduced by making an option position gamma 
 neutral. If Γ is the gamma of the position being hedged, this reduction is usually 
achieved by taking a position in a traded option that has a gamma of -Γ.
Delta and gamma hedging are both based on the assumption that the volatility of the 
underlying asset is constant. In practice, volatilities do change over time. The vega of an option or an option portfolio measures the rate of change of its value with respect to volatility, often implied volatility. Sometimes the same change is assumed to apply to all implied volatilities. A trader who wishes to hedge an option position against volatility changes can make the position vega neutral. As with the procedure for creating gamma  neutrality, this usually involves taking an offsetting position in a traded option. If the 
trader wishes to achieve both gamma and vega neutrality, at least two traded options are usually required.
Two other measures of the risk of an option position are theta and rho. Theta 
 measures the rate of change of the value of the position with respect to the passage of 
time, with all else remaining constant. Rho measures the rate of change of the value of the position with respect to the interest rate, with all else remaining constant.
In practice, option traders usually rebalance their portfolios at least once a day to  
maintain delta neutrality. It is usually not feasible to maintain gamma and vega  neutrality on a regular basis. Typically a trader monitors these measures. If they get 
too large, either corrective action is taken or trading is curtailed.
Portfolio managers are sometimes interested in creating put options synthetically for  
the purposes of insuring an equity portfolio. They can do so either by trading the  portfolio or by trading index futures on the portfolio. Trading the portfolio involves 
splitting the portfolio between equities and risk-free securities. As the market declines,  
more is invested in risk-free securities. As the market increases, more is invested in  equities. Trading index futures involves keeping the equity portfolio intact and selling  
index futures. As the market declines, more index futures are sold; as it rises, fewer are  
sold. This type of portfolio insurance works well in normal market conditions. On 
 Monday, October 19, 1987, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped very 
sharply, it worked badly. Portfolio insurers were unable to sell either stocks or index futures fast enough to protect their positions.

option is 0.7?
 19.2. Calculate the delta of an at-the-money six-month European call option on a non- dividend-paying stock when the risk-free interest rate is 10% per annum and the stock price volatility is 25% per annum.
 19.3. “The procedure for creating an option position synthetically is the reverse of the  procedure for hedging the option position.” Explain this statement.
 19.4. The Black–Scholes–Merton price of an out-of-the-money call option with an exercise 
price of $40 is $4. A trader who has written the option plans to use a stop-loss strategy. The trader’s plan is to buy at $40.10 and to sell at $39.90. Estimate the expected number of times the stock will be bought or sold.
 19.5. Suppose that a stock price is currently $20 and that a call option with an exercise price of $25 is created synthetically using a continually changing position in the stock. Consider the following two scenarios: (a) Stock price increases steadily from $20 to $35 during the life of the option; (b) Stock price oscillates wildly, ending up at $35.

Assume that the schemes are designed to provide insurance against the value of the assets declining by more than 5% within 1 year.

APPENDIX 
TAYLOR SERIES EXPANSIONS AND GREEK LETTERS
A Taylor series expansion of the change in the portfolio value in a short period of time 
shows the role played by different Greek letters. If the volatility of the underlying asset is assumed to be constant, the value ∑ of the portfolio is a function of the asset price S, and time t. The Taylor series expansion gives
        
∆Π=0Π
0S∆S+0Π
0t∆t+1
2 02Π
0S2∆S2+1
2 02Π
0t2∆t2+02Π
0S 0t∆S ∆t+g (19A.1)
where ∆Π and ∆S are the change in Π and S in a small time interval ∆t. Delta hedging 
eliminates the first term on the right-hand side. The second term is nonstochastic. The 
third term (which is of order ∆t) can be made zero by ensuring that the portfolio is 
gamma neutral as well as delta neutral. Other terms are of order higher than ∆t.
For a delta-neutral portfolio, the first term on the right-hand side of equation (19A.1) 
is zero, so that
∆Π=Θ ∆t+1
2Γ ∆S2
when terms of order higher than ∆t are ignored. This is equation (19.3).
The Practitioner Black–Scholes Model
In practice, volatility is not constant. As explained in this chapter, practitioners usually  
set volatility equal to implied volatility when calculating Greek letters. From the  definition of implied volatility, the option price is an exact function of the asset price, 
implied volatility, time, interest rates, and dividends. As an approximation, we can ignore changes in interest rates and dividends and assume that an option price, f, is at any given time a function of only two variables: the asset price, S, and the implied volatility, s
imp. 
The change in the option price over a short period of time is then given by
∆f=0f
0S∆S+0f
0simp∆simp+1
2 02f
0S21∆S22+1
2 02f
0s2
imp1∆simp22+02f
0S0simp∆S∆simp+g
Delta, vega, and gamma hedging deal with the first three terms in this expansion (which are the most important ones). Traders sometimes define other Greek letters such as 
02f>0s2
imp and 02f>0S 0simp to explore their exposure to later terms in the  Taylor series.
When portfolios of options are considered, the trader’s problem is more complicated 
because the implied volatility of an option on a particular asset depends on the option’s 
strike price and time to maturity. The trader must consider the portfolio’s exposure to the different ways the volatility surface can change over a short period of time. Volatility surfaces are discussed in the next chapter.

Volatility Smiles 
and Volatility 
Surfaces
How close are the market prices of options to those predicted by the Black–Scholes– 
Merton model? Do traders really use the Black–Scholes–Merton model when determin­ing a price for an option? Are the probability distributions of asset prices really log­ normal? This chapter answers these questions. It explains that traders do use the Black– Scholes–Merton model—but not in exactly the way that Black, Scholes, and Merton originally intended. This is because they allow the volatility used to price an option to depend on its strike price and time to maturity.
A plot of the implied volatility of an option with a certain life as a function of its strike  
price is known as a volatility smile. A three­dimensional plot of the implied volatility as a function of both strike price and time to maturity is known as a volatility surface. This chapter describes the volatility smiles and volatility surfaces that traders use in equity and  
foreign currency markets. It explains the relationship between a volatility smile and the  
risk­neutral probability distribution being assumed for the future asset price. It also discusses how traders use volatility surfaces as option­pricing tools.20 CHAPTER  
This section shows that the implied volatility of a European call option is the same as  
that of a European put option when they have the same strike price and time to  
maturity. This is a particularly convenient result. It shows that when talking about a volatility smile or volatility surface we do not have to worry about whether the options are calls or puts.
As explained in earlier chapters, put–call parity provides a relationship between the  
prices of European call and put options when they have the same strike price and time to maturity. With a dividend yield on the underlying asset of q, the relationship is
 
p+S0e-qT=c+Ke-rT (20.1)
As usual, c and p are the European call and put price. They have the same strike  
price, K, and time to maturity, T. The variable S0 is the price of the underlying asset 
today, and r is the risk­free interest rate for maturity T.
A key feature of the put–call parity relationship is that it is based on a relatively  
simple no­arbitrage argument. It does not require any assumption about the probability  20.1 IMPLIED VOLATILITIES OF CALLS AND PUTS

distribution of the asset price in the future. It is true both when the asset price   
distribution is lognormal and when it is not lognormal.
Suppose that, for a particular value of the volatility, pBS and cBS are the values of  
European put and call options calculated using the Black–Scholes–Merton model.  
Suppose further that pmkt and cmkt are the market values of these options. Because 
put–call parity holds for the Black–Scholes–Merton model, we must have
pBS+S0e-qT=cBS+Ke-rT
In the absence of arbitrage opportunities, put–call parity also holds for the market 
prices, so that
pmkt+S0e-qT=cmkt+Ke-rT
Subtracting these two equations, we get
 pBS-pmkt=cBS-cmkt (20.2)
This shows that the dollar pricing error when the Black–Scholes–Merton model is used 
to price a European put option should be exactly the same as the dollar pricing error when it is used to price a European call option with the same strike price and time to maturity.
Suppose that the implied volatility of the put option is 22%. This means that 
pBS=pmkt when a volatility of 22% is used in the Black–Scholes–Merton model. From  
equation (20.2), it follows that cBS=cmkt when this volatility is used. The implied 
 volatility of the call is, therefore, also 22%. This argument shows that the implied 
 volatility of a European call option is always the same as the implied volatility of a 
European put option when the two have the same strike price and maturity date. To put  
this another way, for a given strike price and maturity, the correct volatility to use in conjunction with the Black–Scholes–Merton model to price a European call should always be the same as that used to price a European put. This means that the volatility smile (i.e., the relationship between implied volatility and strike price for a particular maturity) is the same for European calls and European puts. More generally, it means that the volatility surface (i.e., the implied volatility as a function of strike price and time  
to maturity) is the same for European calls and European puts. These results are also true  
to a good approximation for American options.
Example 20.1
The value of a foreign currency is $0.60. The risk­free interest rate is 5% per annum  
in the United States and 10% per annum in the foreign country. The market price 
of a European call option on the foreign currency with a maturity of 1 year and a  
strike price of $0.59 is 0.0236. DerivaGem shows that the implied volatility of the  
call is 14.5%. For there to be no arbitrage, the put–call parity relationship in  
equation (20.1) must apply with q equal to the foreign risk­free rate. The price p  
of a European put option with a strike price of $0.59 and maturity of 1 year  
therefore satisfies
p+0.60e-0.10*1=0.0236+0.59e-0.05*1
so that p=0.0419. DerivaGem shows that, when the put has this price, its implied 
volatility is also 14.5%. This is what we expect from the analysis just given.
M20_HULL0654_11_GE_C20.indd   452 30/04/2021   17:35Volatility Smiles and Volatility Surfaces 453
The volatility smile used by traders to price foreign currency options tends to have the 
general form shown in Figure 20.1. The implied volatility is relatively low for at­the­money options. It becomes progressively higher as an option moves either into the money or out of the money.
In the appendix at the end of this chapter, we show how to determine the risk­neutral  
probability distribution for an asset price at a future time from the volatility smile given  
by options maturing at that time. We refer to this as the implied distribution. The  
volatility smile in Figure 20.1 corresponds to the implied distribution shown by the solid line in Figure 20.2. A lognormal distribution with the same mean and standard deviation as the implied distribution is shown by the dashed line in Figure 20.2. It can be  
seen that the implied distribution has heavier tails than the lognormal distribution.
1
To see that Figures 20.1 and 20.2 are consistent with each other, consider first a deep­
out­of­the­money call option with a high strike price of K2 (K2>S0 well above 1.0). This 
option pays off only if the exchange rate proves to be above K2. Figure 20.2 shows that 
the probability of this is higher for the implied probability distribution than for the lognormal distribution. We therefore expect the implied distribution to give a  relatively 
high price for the option. A relatively high price leads to a relatively high implied   
volatility—and this is exactly what we observe in Figure 20.1 for the option. The two 
figures are therefore consistent with each other for high strike prices. Consider next a 
deep­out­of­the­money put option with a low strike price of 
K1 (K1>S0 well below 1.0). 
This option pays off only if the exchange rate proves to be below K1. Figure 20.2 shows 
that the probability of this is also higher for the implied probability distribution than for the lognormal distribution. We therefore expect the implied distribution to give a  
relatively high price, and a relatively high implied volatility, for this option as well. Again, this is exactly what we observe in Figure 20.1.20.2 VOLATILITY SMILE FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTIONS

“peaked. ” Both small and large movements in the exchange rate are more likely than with the lognormal 
distribution. Intermediate movements are less likely.

Empirical Results
We have just shown that the volatility smile used by traders for foreign currency options 
implies that they consider that the lognormal distribution understates the probability of  
extreme movements in exchange rates. To test whether they are right, Table 20.1  
examines the daily movements in 10 different exchange rates over a 10­year period between 2005 and 2015. The exchange rates are those between the U.S. dollar and the following currencies: Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Danish krone, euro, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, New Zealand dollar, Swedish krona, and Swiss  
franc. The first step in the production of the table is to calculate the standard deviation of daily percentage change in each exchange rate. The next stage is to note how often the actual percentage change exceeded 1 standard deviation, 2 standard deviations, and  
so on. The final stage is to calculate how often this would have happened if the  
percentage changes had been normally distributed. (The lognormal model implies that percentage changes are almost exactly normally distributed over a one­day time period.)

Daily changes exceed 3 standard deviations on 1.30% of days. The lognormal model  
predicts that this should happen on only 0.27% of days. Daily changes exceed 4, 5, 
and 6 standard deviations on 0.49%, 0.24%, and 0.13% of days, respectively. The  
lognormal model predicts that we should hardly ever observe this happening. The table therefore provides evidence to support the existence of heavy tails (Figure 20.2) and the  
volatility smile used by traders (Figure 20.1). Business Snapshot 20.1 shows how you  
could have made money if you had done the analysis in Table 20.1 ahead of the rest of  
the market.
Reasons for the Smile in Foreign Currency Options
Why are exchange rates not lognormally distributed? Two of the conditions for an asset price to have a lognormal distribution are:
1. The volatility of the asset is constant.
2. The price of the asset changes smoothly with no jumps.
In practice, neither of these conditions is satisfied for an exchange rate. The volatility of  
an exchange rate is far from constant, and exchange rates frequently exhibit jumps, sometimes in response to the actions of central banks. It turns out that both a   
nonconstant volatility and jumps will have the effect of making extreme outcomes  
more likely.
The impact of jumps and nonconstant volatility depends on the option maturity. As  
the maturity of the option is increased, the percentage impact of a nonconstant   
volatility on prices becomes more pronounced, but its percentage impact on implied 
volatility usually becomes less pronounced. The percentage impact of jumps on both prices and the implied volatility becomes less pronounced as the maturity of the option Business Snapshot 20.1 Making Money from Foreign Currency Options
Black, Scholes, and Merton in their option pricing model assume that the  underlying 
asset price has a lognormal distribution at future times. This is equivalent to the assumption that asset price changes over a short period of time, such as one day, are  
normally distributed. Suppose that most market participants are comfortable with the Black–Scholes–Merton assumptions for exchange rates. You have just done the analysis in Table 20.1 and know that the lognormal assumption is not a good one  
for exchange rates. What should you do?
The answer is that you should buy deep­out­of­the­money call and put options on 
a variety of different currencies and wait. These options will be relatively inexpensive and more of them will close in the money than the lognormal model predicts. The present value of your payoffs will on average be much greater than the cost of the options.
In the mid­1980s, a few traders knew about the heavy tails of foreign exchange 
probability distributions. Everyone else thought that the lognormal assumption of Black–Scholes–Merton was reasonable. The few traders who were well informed followed the strategy we have described—and made lots of money. By the late 1980s everyone realized that foreign currency options should be priced with a volatility smile and the trading opportunity disappeared.
M20_HULL0654_11_GE_C20.indd   455 30/04/2021   17:35456 CHAPTER 20
is increased.2 The result of all this is that the volatility smile becomes less pronounced as  
option maturity increases.
2  When we look at sufficiently long­dated options, jumps tend to get “averaged out, ” so that the exchange 
rate distribution when there are jumps is almost indistinguishable from the one obtained when the exchange 
rate changes smoothly.Figure 20.3 Volatility smile for equities (K=strike price, S0=current equity price).

volatility
1.0K/S0Prior to the crash of 1987, there was no marked volatility smile for equity options. Since 
1987, the volatility smile used by traders to price equity options (both on individual stocks and on stock indices) has tended to look like that in Figure 20.3. This is sometimes referred to as a volatility skew. The volatility decreases as the strike price increases. The volatility used to price a low­strike­price option (i.e., a deep­out­of­the­money put or a  
deep­in­the­money call) is significantly higher than that used to price a high­strike­price option (i.e., a deep­in­the­money put or a deep­out­of­the­money call).
The volatility smile for equity options corresponds to the implied probability dis­ 
tribution given by the solid line in Figure 20.4. A lognormal distribution with the same  
mean and standard deviation as the implied distribution is shown by the dotted line. It can be seen that the implied distribution has a heavier left tail and a less heavy right tail than the lognormal distribution.
To see that Figures 20.3 and 20.4 are consistent with each other, we proceed as for  
Figures 20.1 and 20.2 and consider options that are deep out of the money. From  
Figure 20.4, a deep­out­of­the­money call with a strike price of 
K2 (K2>S0 well  
above 1.0) has a lower price when the implied distribution is used than when the 20.3 VOLATILITY SMILE FOR EQUITY OPTIONS

 lognormal distribution is used. This is because the option pays off only if the stock price 
proves to be above K2, and the probability of this is lower for the implied  probability 
distribution than for the lognormal distribution. Therefore, we expect the implied  distribution to give a relatively low price for the option. A relatively low price leads  
to a relatively low implied volatility—and this is exactly what we observe in Figure 20.3 
for the option. Consider next a deep­out­of­the­money put option with a strike price  
of 
K1. This option pays off only if the stock price proves to be below K1 (K1>S0 well 
below 1.0). Figure 20.4 shows that the probability of this is higher for the implied   
probability distribution than for the lognormal distribution. We therefore expect the  
implied distribution to give a relatively high price, and a relatively high implied  
volatility, for this option. Again, this is exactly what we observe in Figure 20.3.
The Reason for the Smile in Equity Options
There is a negative correlation between equity prices and volatility.3 As prices move 
down (up), volatilities tend to move up (down). There are several possible reasons for  
this. One concerns leverage. As equity prices move down (up), leverage increases 
(decreases) and as a result volatility increases (decreases). Another is referred to as the volatility feedback effect. As volatility increases (decreases) because of external 
factors, investors require a higher (lower) return and as a result the stock price declines (increases). A further explanation is crashophobia (see Business Snapshot 20.2).
Whatever the reason for the negative correlation, it means that stock price declines 
are accompanied by increases in volatility, making even greater declines possible. Stock price increases are accompanied by decreases in volatility, making further stock price increases less likely. This explains the heavy left tail and thin right tail of the implied distribution in Figure 20.4.

Business Snapshot 20.2 Crashophobia
It is interesting that the pattern in Figure 20.3 for equities has existed only since the  
stock market crash of October 1987. Prior to October 1987, implied volatilities were  
much less dependent on strike price. This has led Mark Rubinstein to suggest that  
one reason for the equity volatility smile may be “crashophobia.” Traders are  
concerned about the possibility of another crash similar to October 1987, and they 
price options accordingly.
There is some empirical support for this explanation. Declines in the S&P 500 tend  
to be accompanied by a steepening of the volatility skew. When the S&P increases, the skew tends to become less steep.
4 Research by Derman suggests that this adjustment is sometimes “sticky” in the case of exchange­traded 
options. See E. Derman, “Regimes of Volatility, ” Risk, April 1999: 55–59.There are a number of ways of characterizing the volatility smile. Sometimes it is shown as the relationship between implied volatility and strike price K. However, this relation­ship depends on the price of the asset. As the price of the asset increases (decreases), the  
central at­the­money strike price increases (decreases) so that the curve relating the implied volatility to the strike price moves to right (left).
4 For this reason the implied 
volatility is often plotted as a function of the strike price divided by the current asset price, 
K>S0. This is what we have done Figures 20.1 and 20.3.
A refinement of this is to calculate the volatility smile as the relationship between the 
implied volatility and K>F0, where F0 is the forward price of the asset for a contract 
maturing at the same time as the options that are considered. Traders also often define an “at­the­money” option as an option where 
K=F0, not as an option where K=S0. 
The argument for this is that F0, not S0, is the expected stock price on the option’s 
 maturity date in a risk­neutral world.
Yet another approach to defining the volatility smile is as the relationship between the 
implied volatility and the delta of the option (where delta is defined as in Chapter 19). 
This approach sometimes makes it possible to apply volatility smiles to options other than European and American calls and puts. When the approach is used, an at­the­money option is then defined as a call option with a delta of 0.5 or a put option with a delta of 
-0.5. These are referred to as “50­delta options.”20.4 ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF CHARACTERIZING THE  
VOLATILITY SMILE
Traders allow the implied volatility to depend on time to maturity as well as strike price.  
Implied volatility tends to be an increasing function of maturity when short­dated  volatilities are historically low. This is because there is then an expectation that 
 volatilities will increase. Similarly, volatility tends to be a decreasing function of  20.5 THE VOLATILITY TERM STRUCTURE AND  
VOLATILITY SURFACES

maturity when short­dated volatilities are historically high. This is because there is then 
an expectation that volatilities will decrease.
Volatility surfaces combine volatility smiles with the volatility term structure to  
tabulate the volatilities appropriate for pricing an option with any strike price and  
any maturity. An example of a volatility surface that might be used for foreign currency options is given in Table 20.2.
One dimension of Table 20.2 is 
K>S0; the other is time to maturity. The main body of  
the table shows implied volatilities calculated from the Black–Scholes–Merton model. At  
any given time, some of the entries in the table are likely to correspond to options for which reliable market data are available. The implied volatilities for these options are calculated directly from their market prices and entered into the table. The rest of the table is typically determined using interpolation. The table shows that the volatility smile  
becomes less pronounced as the option maturity increases. As mentioned earlier, this is what is observed for currency options. (It is also what is observed for options on most other assets.)
When a new option has to be valued, financial engineers look up the appropriate 
volatility in the table. For example, when valuing a 9­month option with a 
K>S0 ratio of 
1.05, a financial engineer would interpolate between 13.4 and 14.0 in Table 20.2 to obtain a volatility of 13.7%. This is the volatility that would be used in the Black–Scholes– Merton formula or a binomial tree. When valuing a 1.5­year option with a 
K>S0 ratio of  
0.925, a two­dimensional (bilinear) interpolation would be used to give an implied volatility of 14.525%.
The shape of the volatility smile depends on the option maturity. As illustrated in 
Table 20.2, the smile tends to become less pronounced as the option maturity increases. 
Define T as the time to maturity and 
F0 as the forward price of the asset for a contract 
maturing at the same time as the option. Some financial engineers choose to define the volatility smile as the relationship between implied volatility and
1
2T ln aK
F0b
rather than as the relationship between the implied volatility and K. The smile is then 
usually much less dependent on the time to maturity.Table 20.2  Volatility surface.

The formulas for delta and other Greek letters in Chapter 19 assume that the implied 
volatility remains the same when the asset price changes. This is not what is usually expected to happen. Consider, for example, a stock or stock index option.
As explained in Section 20.3, there is a negative correlation between equity prices and  
volatility. The delta that takes this relationship between implied volatilities and equity prices into account is referred to as the minimum variance delta. It is:
∆MV=0fBSM
0S+0fBSM
0simp 0E1simp2
0S
where fBSM is the Black–Scholes–Merton price of the option, simp is the option’s  
implied volatility, E1simp2 denotes the expectation of simp as a function of the equity 
price, S. This gives
∆MV=∆BSM+VBSM0E1simp2
0S
where ∆BSM and VBSM are the delta and vega calculated from the Black–Scholes–Merton  
(constant volatility) model. Because VBSM is positive and, as we have just explained  
 0E1simp2>0S is negative, the minimum variance delta is less than the Black–Scholes– 
Merton delta.520.6 MINIMUM VARIANCE DELTA
How important is the option­pricing model if traders are prepared to use a different volatility for every option? It can be argued that the Black–Scholes–Merton model is  
no more than a sophisticated interpolation tool used by traders for ensuring that an option is priced consistently with the market prices of other actively traded options. If traders stopped using Black–Scholes–Merton and switched to another plausible model, then the volatility surface and the shape of the smile would change, but arguably the dollar prices quoted in the market would not change appreciably. Greek letters and therefore hedging strategies do depend on the model used. An unrealistic model is liable  
to lead to poor hedging.
Models have most effect on the pricing of derivatives when similar derivatives do not  
trade actively in the market. For example, the pricing of many of the nonstandard  
exotic derivatives we will discuss in later chapters is model­dependent.20.7 THE ROLE OF THE MODEL
Let us now consider an example of how an unusual volatility smile might arise in equity markets. Suppose that a stock price is currently $50 and an important news announce­ment due in a few days is expected either to increase the stock price by $8 or to reduce it  
by $8. (This announcement could concern the outcome of a takeover attempt or the 20.8 WHEN A SINGLE LARGE JUMP IS ANTICIPATED

verdict in an important lawsuit.) The probability distribution of the stock price in, say,  
1 month might then consist of a mixture of two lognormal distributions, the first  
corresponding to favorable news, the second to unfavorable news. The situation is  
illustrated in Figure 20.5. The solid line shows the mixture­of­lognormals distribution 
for the stock price in 1 month; the dashed line shows a lognormal distribution with the same mean and standard deviation as this distribution.
The true probability distribution is bimodal (certainly not lognormal). One easy way 
to investigate the general effect of a bimodal stock price distribution is to consider the extreme case where there are only two possible future stock prices. This is what we will  
now do.
Suppose that the stock price is currently $50 and it is known that in 1 month it will be  
either $42 or $58. Suppose further that the risk­free rate is 12% per annum. The  situation  
is illustrated in Figure 20.6. Options can be valued using the binomial model from  
Chapter 13. In this case, 
u=1.16, d=0.84, a=1.0101, and p=0.5314. The results 
from valuing a range of different options are shown in Table 20.3. The first column shows 
alternative strike prices; the second shows prices of 1­month European call options; the third shows the prices of one­month European put option prices; and the fourth shows Figure 20.5 Effect of a single large jump. The solid line is the true distribution; the 
dashed line is the lognormal distribution.

implied volatilities. (As shown in Section 20.1, the implied volatility of a European put 
option is the same as that of a European call option when they have the same strike price  
and maturity.) Figure 20.7 displays the volatility smile from Table 20.3. It is actually a “frown” (the opposite of that observed for currencies) with volatilities declining as we move out of or into the money. The volatility implied from an option with a strike price of 50 will overprice an option with a strike price of 44 or 56.
SUMMARY
The Black–Scholes–Merton model and its extensions assume that the  probability 
 distribution of the underlying asset at any given future time is lognormal. This  Table 20.3  Implied volatilities in situation where it is known that the stock price

assumption is not the one made by traders. They assume the probability distribution of  
an equity price has a heavier left tail and a less heavy right tail than the lognormal 
 distribution. They also assume that the probability distribution of an exchange rate has 
a heavier right tail and a heavier left tail than the lognormal distribution.
Traders use volatility smiles to allow for nonlognormality. The volatility smile defines  
the relationship between the implied volatility of an option and its strike price. For equity options, the volatility smile tends to be downward sloping. This means that out­of­the­money puts and in­the­money calls tend to have high implied volatilities whereas out­of­the­money calls and in­the­money puts tend to have low implied volatilities. For foreign currency options, the volatility smile is U­shaped. Both out­of­the­money and in­the­money options have higher implied volatilities than at­the­money options.
Often traders also use a volatility term structure. The implied volatility of an option 
then depends on its life. When volatility smiles and volatility term structures are  combined, they produce a volatility surface. This defines implied volatility as a function 
of both the strike price and the time to maturity.

Practice Questions
 20.1. What volatility smile is likely to be observed when:
(a) Both tails of the stock price distribution are less heavy than those of the lognormal  
distribution?
(b) The right tail is heavier, and the left tail is less heavy, than that of a lognormal 
 distribution?
 20.2. What volatility smile is likely to be caused by jumps in the underlying asset price? Is the pattern likely to be more pronounced for a 2­year option than for a 3­month option?
 20.3. A European call and put option have the same strike price and time to maturity. The call  
has an implied volatility of 30% and the put has an implied volatility of 25%. What  
trades would you do?
 20.4. Explain carefully why a distribution with a heavier left tail and less heavy right tail than the lognormal distribution gives rise to a downward sloping volatility smile.
 20.5. The market price of a European call is $3.00 and its price given by Black–Scholes– Merton  
model with a volatility of 30% is $3.50. The price given by this Black–Scholes–Merton model for a European put option with the same strike price and time to maturity is $1.00. What should the market price of the put option be? Explain the reasons for your answer.
 20.6. Explain what is meant by “crashophobia.”
 20.7. A stock price is currently $20. Tomorrow, news is expected to be announced that will either increase the price by $5 or decrease the price by $5. What are the problems in  
using Black–Scholes–Merton to value 1­month options on the stock?
 20.8. What volatility smile is likely to be observed for 6­month options when the volatility is uncertain and positively correlated with the stock price?
 20.9. Explain the problems in testing a stock option pricing model empirically.
 20.10. Suppose that a central bank’s policy is to allow an exchange rate to fluctuate between 
0.97 and 1.03. What pattern of implied volatilities for options on the exchange rate  
would you expect to see?
 20.11. Option traders sometimes refer to deep­out­of­the­money options as being options on 
volatility. Why do you think they do this?
 20.12. A European call option on a certain stock has a strike price of $30, a time to maturity of 
1 year, and an implied volatility of 30%. A European put option on the same stock has a  
strike price of $30, a time to maturity of 1 year, and an implied volatility of 33%. What is the arbitrage opportunity open to a trader? Does the arbitrage work only when the lognormal assumption underlying Black–Scholes–Merton holds? Explain carefully the reasons for your answer.
 20.13. Suppose that the result of a major lawsuit affecting a company is due to be announced 
tomorrow. The company’s stock price is currently $60. If the ruling is favorable to the company, the stock price is expected to jump to $75. If it is unfavorable, the stock is expected to jump to $50. What is the risk­neutral probability of a favorable ruling?
  Assume that the volatility of the company’s stock will be 25% for 6 months after the  
ruling if the ruling is favorable and 40% if it is unfavorable. Use DerivaGem to calculate  
the relationship between implied volatility and strike price for 6­month European

options on the company today. The company does not pay dividends. Assume that  
the 6­month risk­free rate is 6%. Consider call options with strike prices of $30, $40, $50, 
$60, $70, and $80.
 20.14. An exchange rate is currently 0.8000. The volatility of the exchange rate is quoted as  
12% and interest rates in the two countries are the same. Using the lognormal  
assumption, estimate the probability that the exchange rate in 3 months will be (a) less 
than 0.7000, (b) between 0.7000 and 0.7500, (c) between 0.7500 and 0.8000, (d) between 0.8000 and 0.8500, (e) between 0.8500 and 0.9000, and (f) greater than 0.9000. Based on  
the volatility smile usually observed in the market for exchange rates, which of these estimates would you expect to be too low and which would you expect to be too high?
 20.15. A stock price is $40. A 6­month European call option on the stock with a strike price of 
$30 has an implied volatility of 35%. A 6­month European call option on the stock with  
a strike price of $50 has an implied volatility of 28%. The 6­month risk­free rate is 5% and no dividends are expected. Explain why the two implied volatilities are different. Use  
DerivaGem to calculate the prices of the two options. Use put–call parity to calculate  
the prices of 6­month European put options with strike prices of $30 and $50. Use DerivaGem to calculate the implied volatilities of these two put options.
 20.16. “The Black–Scholes–Merton model is used by traders as an interpolation tool.” Discuss 
this view.
 20.17. Using Table 20.2, calculate the implied volatility a trader would use for an 8­month 
option with 
K>S0=1.04.
 20.18. A company’s stock is selling for $4. The company has no outstanding debt. Analysts 
 consider the liquidation value of the company to be at least $300,000 and there are 
100,000 shares outstanding. What volatility smile would you expect to see?

APPENDIX 
DETERMINING IMPLIED RISK-NEUTRAL DISTRIBUTIONS 
FROM VOLATILITY SMILES
The price of a European call option on an asset with strike price K and maturity T is 
given by
c=e-rT 3∞
ST=K1ST-K2g1ST2dST
where r is the interest rate (assumed constant), ST is the asset price at time T, and g is 
the risk­neutral probability density function of ST. Differentiating once with respect  
to K gives
0c
0K=-e-rT 3∞
ST=Kg1ST2dST
Differentiating again with respect to K gives
02c
0K2=e-rT g1K2
This shows that the probability density function g is given by
 g1K2=erT02 c
0K2 (20A.1)
This result, which is from Breeden and Litzenberger (1978), allows risk­neutral prob­
ability distributions to be estimated from volatility smiles.6 Suppose that c1, c2, and c3  
are the prices of T­year European call options with strike prices of K-d, K, and K+d,  
respectively. Assuming d is small, an estimate of g1K2, obtained by approximating the 
partial derivative in equation (20A.1), is
erT c1+c3-2c2
d2
For another way of understanding this formula, suppose you set up a butterfly spread 
with strike prices K-d, K, and K+d, and maturity T. This means that you buy a call  
with strike price K-d, buy a call with strike price K+d, and sell two calls with strike  
price K. The value of your position is c1+c3-2c2. The value of the position can also be  
calculated by integrating the payoff over the risk­neutral probability distribution,  g1ST2,  
and discounting at the risk­free rate. The payoff is shown in Figure 20A.1. Since d is small,  
we can assume that g1ST2=g1K2 in the whole of the range K-d6ST6K+d, where 
the payoff is nonzero. The area under the “spike” in Figure 20A.1 is 0.5*2d*d=d2. 
The value of the payoff (when d is small) is therefore e-rT g1K2d2. It follows that
e-rT g1K2d2=c1+c3-2c2

Example 20A.1
Suppose that the price of a non­dividend­paying stock is $10, the risk­free interest 
rate is 3%, and the implied volatilities of 3­month European options with strike prices of $6, $7, $8, $9, $10, $11, $12, $13, $14 are 30%, 29%, 28%, 27%, 26%, 25%, 24%, 23%, 22%, respectively. One way of applying the above results is as  
follows. Assume that 
g1ST2 is constant between ST=6 and ST=7, constant 
between ST=7 and ST=8, and so on. Define:
 g1ST2=g1 for 6…ST67
 g1ST2=g2 for 7…ST68
 g1ST2=g3 for 8…ST69
 g1ST2=g4 for 9…ST610
 g1ST2=g5 for 10…ST611
 g1ST2=g6 for 11…ST612
 g1ST2=g7 for 12…ST613
 g1ST2=g8 for 13…ST614
The value of g1 can be calculated by interpolating to get the implied volatility for 
a 3­month option with a strike price of $6.5 as 29.5%. This means that options with strike prices of $6, $6.5, and $7 have implied volatilities of 30%, 29.5%, and 29%, respectively. From DerivaGem their prices are $4.045, $3.549, and $3.055, respectively. Using equation (20A.2), with 
K=6.5 and d=0.5, gives
g1=e0.03*0.2514.045+3.055-2*3.549)
0.52=0.0057
Similar calculations show that
g2=0.0444, g3=0.1545, g4=0.2781
g5=0.2813, g6=0.1659, g7=0.0573, g8=0.0113

Figure 20A.2 displays the implied distribution. (Note that the area under the  
probability distribution is 0.9985. The probability that ST66 or ST714 is there­  
fore 0.0015.) Although not obvious from Figure 20A.2, the implied distribution 
does have a heavier left tail and less heavy right tail than a lognormal distribu­ tion. For the lognormal distribution based on a single volatility of 26%, the  
probability of a stock price between $6 and $7 is 0.0031 (compared with 0.0057 in Figure 20A.2) and the probability of a stock price between $13 and $14 is  
0.0167 (compared with 0.0113 in Figure 20A.2).Figure 20A.2 Implied probability distribution for Example 20A.1.

results such as the Black–Scholes–Merton formulas do not exist. The first represents the asset price movements in the form of a tree and was introduced in Chapter 13. The second is Monte Carlo simulation, which we encountered briefly in Chapter 14 when stochastic processes were explained. The third involves finite difference methods.
Monte Carlo simulation is usually used for derivatives where the payoff is dependent 
on the history of the underlying variable or where there are several underlying variables. Trees and finite difference methods are usually used for American options and other derivatives where the holder has decisions to make prior to maturity. In addition to valuing a derivative, all the procedures can be used to calculate Greek letters such as delta, gamma, and vega.
The basic procedures discussed in this chapter can be used to handle most of the 
derivatives valuation problems encountered in practice. However, sometimes they have to be adapted to cope with particular situations, as will be explained in Chapter 27.21 CHAPTER  
Binomial trees were introduced in Chapter 13. They can be used to value either  European or American options. The Black–Scholes–Merton formulas and their exten-
sions that were presented in Chapters 15, 17, and 18 provide analytic valuations for European options.
1 There are no analytic valuations for American options. Binomial 
trees are therefore most useful for valuing these types of options.2
As explained in Chapter 13, the binomial tree valuation approach involves dividing 
the life of the option into a large number of small time intervals of length ∆t. It assumes 
that in each time interval the price of the underlying asset moves from its initial value of S to one of two new values, Su and Sd. The approach is illustrated in Figure 21.1. In 21.1 BINOMIAL TREES
1  The Black–Scholes–Merton formulas are based on the same set of assumptions as binomial trees. As shown 
in the appendix to Chapter 13, in the limit as the number of time steps is increased, the price given by a  
binomial tree for a European option converges to the Black–Scholes–Merton price.
2 Some analytic approximations for valuing American options have been suggested. See, for example,  
Technical Note 8 at www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull/TechnicalNotes for a description of the quadratic 
approximation approach.

general, u71 and d61. The movement from S to Su, therefore, is an “up” movement 
and the movement from S to Sd is a “down” movement. The probability of an up  
movement will be denoted by p. The probability of a down movement is 1-p.
Risk-Neutral Valuation
The risk-neutral valuation principle, explained in Chapters 13 and 15, states that an 
option (or other derivative) can be valued on the assumption that the world is risk neutral. This means that for valuation purposes we can use the following procedure:
1. Assume that the expected return from all traded assets is the risk-free interest rate.
2. Value payoffs from the derivative by calculating their expected values and  
discounting at the risk-free interest rate.
This principle underlies the way trees are used.
Determination of p , u, and d
The parameters p, u, and d must give correct values for the mean and variance of asset 
price changes during a time interval of length ∆t. Because we are working in a risk- 
neutral world, the expected return from the asset is the risk-free interest rate, r. Suppose that the asset provides a yield of q . The expected return in the form of capital gains must 
be 
r-q. This means that the expected value of the asset price at the end of a time interval 
of length ∆t must be Se1r-q2∆t, where S is the asset price at the beginning of the time 
interval. To match the mean return with the tree, we therefore need
Se1r-q2∆t=pSu+11-p2Sd
or
 e1r-q2∆t=pu+11-p2d (21.1)
The variance of a variable Q is defined as E1Q22-3E1Q242. Defining R as the  
percentage change in the asset price in time ∆t, there is a probability p that 1+R is  
u and a probability 1-p that it is d. Using equation (21.1), it follows that the variance 
of 1+R is
pu2+11-p2d2-e21r-q2∆t
Since adding a constant to a variable makes no difference to its variance, the variance 
of 1+R is the same as the variance of R . As explained in Section 15.4, this is s2 ∆t.p

Hence,
pu2+11-p2d2-e21r-q2∆t=s2∆t
From equation (21.1), e1r-q2∆t1u+d2=pu2+11-p2d2+ud, so that
 e1r-q2∆t1u+d2-ud-e21r-q2∆t=s2∆t (21.2)
Equations (21.1) and (21.2) impose two conditions on p, u, and d. A third condition  
used by Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein (1979) is3
 u=1>d (21.3)

ignored, is4

u-d (21.4)
 u=es2∆t (21.5)
 d=e-s2∆t (21.6)
where
 a=e 1r-q2∆t (21.7)
The variable a is sometimes referred to as the growth factor. Equations (21.4) to (21.7) 
are the same as those in Sections 13.8 and 13.11.
Tree of Asset Prices
Figure 21.2 shows the complete tree of asset prices that is considered when the binomial 
model is used with four time steps. At time zero, the asset price, S0, is known. At time 
∆t, there are two possible asset prices, S0u and S0d; at time 2∆t, there are three possible 
asset prices, S0u2, S0, and S0d2; and so on. In general, at time i ∆t, we consider i+1  
asset prices. These are
S0ujd i-j, j=0, 1, c, i
Note that the relationship u=1>d is used in computing the asset price at each node of  
the tree in Figure 21.2. For example, the asset price when j=2 and i=3 is 
S0u2d=S0u. Note also that the tree recombines in the sense that an up movement 
followed by a down movement leads to the same asset price as a down movement  
followed by an up movement.
Working Backward through the Tree
Options are evaluated by starting at the end of the tree (time T ) and working backward. 
This is known as backward induction. The value of the option is known at time T . For  
example, a put option is worth max1K-ST, 02 and a call option is worth max1ST-K, 02, 
3 See J. C. Cox, S. A. Ross, and M. Rubinstein, “Option Pricing: A Simplified Approach, ” Journal of  
Financial Economics, 7 (October 1979), 229–63.
4  To see this, we note that equations (21. 4) and (21. 7) satisfy the conditions in equations (21. 1) and (21. 3) 
exactly.  The exponential function ex can be expanded as 1+x+x2>2+P. When terms of higher order than  
∆t are ignored, equation (21. 5) implies that u=1+s2∆t+1
2s2∆t and equation (21. 6) implies that 
d=1-s2∆t+1
2s2∆t. Also, e1r-q2∆t=1+1r-q2∆t and e21r-q2∆t=1+2 1r-q2∆t. By substitution, we see 
that equation (21. 2) is satisfied when terms of higher order than ∆t are ignored.
M21_HULL0654_11_GE_C21.indd   472 30/04/2021   17:36Basic Numerical Procedures 473
where ST is the asset price at time T and K is the strike price. Because a risk-neutral world is 
being assumed, the value at each node at time T-∆t can be calculated as the expected 
value at time T  discounted at rate r  for a time period ∆t. Similarly, the value at each node 
at time T-2∆t can be calculated as the expected value at time T-∆t discounted for a  
time period ∆t at rate r , and so on. If the option is American, it is necessary to check at 
each node to see whether early exercise is preferable to holding the option for a further 
time period ∆t. Eventually, by working back through all the nodes, we are able to obtain 
the value of the option at time zero.
Example 21.1
Consider a 5-month American put option on a non-dividend-paying stock when 
the stock price is $50, the strike price is $50, the risk-free interest rate is 10% per annum, and the volatility is 40% per annum. With our usual notation, this means that 
S0=50, K=50, r =0.10, s=0.40, T=0.4167, and q=0. Suppose that we 
divide the life of the option into five intervals of length 1 month (=0.0833 year2 
for the purposes of constructing a binomial tree. Then ∆t=0.0833 and using 
equations (21.4) to (21.7) gives
u=es2∆t=1.1224,     d=e-s2∆t=0.8909,     a=er∆t=1.0084
p=a-d
u-d=0.5073,    1-p=0.4927
Figure 21.3 shows the binomial tree produced by DerivaGem. At each node there 
are two numbers. The top one shows the stock price at the node; the lower one shows the value of the option at the node. The probability of an up movement is always 0.5073; the probability of a down movement is always 0.4927 .Figure 21.2 Tree used to value an option.

The stock price at the jth node 1j=0, 1, c, i2 at time i ∆t 1i=0, 1, c, 52 is  
calculated as S0ujdi-j. For example, the stock price at node A 1i=4, j=12 (i.e.,  
the second node up at the end of the fourth time step) is 50*1.1224*0.89093 = 
$39.69. The option prices at the final nodes are calculated as max1K-ST, 02. For  
example, the option price at node G is 50.00-35.36=14.64. The option prices at  
the penultimate nodes are calculated from the option prices at the final nodes.  
First, we assume no exercise of the option at the nodes. This means that the  
option price is calculated as the present value of the expected option price one  
time step later. For example, at node E, the option price is calculated as
10.5073*0+0.4927*5.452e-0.10*0.0833=2.66
whereas at node A it is calculated as
10.5073*5.45+0.4927*14.642e-0.10*0.0833=9.90Figure 21.3 Binomial tree from DerivaGem for American put on non-dividend-

We then check to see if early exercise is preferable to waiting. At node E, early 
exercise would give a value for the option of zero because both the stock price and  
strike price are $50. Clearly it is best to wait. The correct value for the option at  
node E is therefore $2.66. At node A, it is a different story. If the option is  
exercised, it is worth +50.00-+39.69, or $10.31. This is more than $9.90. If node 
A is reached, then the option should be exercised and the correct value for the option at node A is $10.31.
Option prices at earlier nodes are calculated in a similar way. Note that it is not 
always best to exercise an option early when it is in the money. Consider node B. If the option is exercised, it is worth 
+50.00-+39.69, or $10.31. However, if it is 
not exercised, it is worth
10.5073*6.38+0.4927*14.642e-0.10*0.0833=10.36
The option should, therefore, not be exercised at this node, and the correct option value at the node is $10.36.
Working back through the tree, the value of the option at the initial node is 
$4.49. This is our numerical estimate for the option’s current value. In practice, a  
smaller value of 
∆t, and many more nodes, would be used. DerivaGem shows  
that with 30, 50, 100, and 500 time steps we get values for the option of 4.263,  
4.272, 4.278, and 4.283.
Expressing the Approach Algebraically
Suppose that the life of an American option is divided into N subintervals of length ∆t.  
We will refer to the jth node at time i ∆t as the 1i, j2 node, where 0…i…N and 
0…j…i. This means that the lowest node at time i ∆t is 1i, 02, the next lowest is 1i, 12,  
and so on. Define fi, j as the value of the option at the 1i, j2 node. The price of the  
underlying asset at the 1i, j2 node is S0ujdi-j. If the option is a call, its value at time T 
(the expiration date) is max1ST-K, 02, so that
fN, j=max1S0ujdN-j-K, 02, j=0, 1, c, N
If the option is a put, its value at time T is max1K-ST, 02, so that
fN, j=max1K-S0ujdN-j, 02, j=0, 1, c, N
There is a probability p of moving from the 1i, j2 node at time i ∆t to the 1i+1, j+12 
node at time 1i+12∆t, and a probability 1-p of moving from the 1i, j2 node at time 
i ∆t to the 1i+1, j2 node at time 1i+12∆t. Assuming no early exercise, risk-neutral 
valuation gives
fi, j=e-r∆t3pfi+1, j+1+11-p2fi+1, j4
for 0…i…N-1 and 0…j…i. When early exercise is possible, this value for fi, j must 
be compared with the option’s intrinsic value, so that for a call
fi, j=max5S0ujdi-j-K, e-r∆t3pfi+1, j+1+11-p2fi+1, j46
and for a put
fi, j=max5K-S0ujd i-j, e-r∆t3pfi+1, j+1+11-p2fi+1, j46
Note that, because the calculations start at time T and work backward, the value at  
M21_HULL0654_11_GE_C21.indd   475 30/04/2021   17:36476 CHAPTER 21
time i ∆t captures not only the effect of early exercise possibilities at time i ∆t, but also 
the effect of early exercise at subsequent times.
In the limit as ∆t tends to zero, an exact value for the American put is obtained. In 
practice, N=30 usually gives reasonable results. Figure 21.4 shows the convergence of  
the option price in Example 21.1. This figure was calculated using the Application 
Builder functions provided with the DerivaGem software (see Sample Application A).
Estimating Delta and Other Greek Letters
It will be recalled that the delta 1∆2 of an option is the rate of change of its price with 
respect to the underlying stock price. It can be calculated as
∆f
∆S
where ∆S is a small change in the asset price and ∆f is the corresponding small change 
in the option price. At time ∆t, we have an estimate f1, 1 for the option price when the  
asset price is S0u and an estimate f1, 0 for the option price when the asset price is S0d. 
This means that, when ∆S=S0u-S0d, ∆f=f1, 1-f1, 0. Therefore an estimate of 
delta at time ∆t is
 ∆=f1, 1-f1, 0
S0u-S0d (21.8)
To determine gamma 1Γ2, note that we have two estimates of ∆ at time 2∆t.  
When S=1S0u2+S02>2 (halfway between the second and third node), delta is 
1f2, 2-f2, 12>1S0u2-S02; when S=1S0+S0d22>2 (halfway between the first and second  
node), delta is 1f2, 1-f2, 02>1S0-S0d22. The difference between the two values of S  is h,  
where
h=0.51S0u2-S0d22Figure 21.4 Convergence of the price of the option in Example 21.1 calculated from 
the DerivaGem Application Builder functions.

Gamma is the change in delta divided by h:
 Γ=31f2, 2-f2, 12>1S0u2-S024-31f2, 1-f2, 02>1S0-S0d224
h (21.9)
These procedures provide estimates of delta at time ∆t and of gamma at time 2∆t. In 
practice, they are usually used as estimates of delta and gamma at time zero as well.5
A further hedge parameter that can be obtained directly from the tree is theta 1Θ2. 
This is the rate of change of the option price with time when all else is kept constant.
The value of the option at time zero is f0, 0 and at time 2∆t it is f2, 1. An estimate of  
theta is therefore
 Θ=f2, 1-f0, 0
2∆t (21.10)
Vega can be calculated by making a small change, ∆s, in the volatility and constructing 
a new tree to obtain a new value of the option. (The number of time steps should be 
kept the same.) The estimate of vega is
V=f*-f
∆s
where f and f* are the estimates of the option price from the original and the new tree, 
respectively. Rho can be calculated similarly.
Example 21.2
Consider again Example 21.1. From Figure 21.3, f1, 0=6.96 and f1, 1=2.16. 
Equation (21.8) gives an estimate for delta of
2.16-6.96
56.12-44.55=-0.41
From equation (21.9), an estimate of the gamma of the option can be obtained 
from the values at nodes B, C, and F as
310.64-3.772>162.99-50.0024-313.77-10.362>150.00-39.6924
11.65=0.03
From equation (21.10), an estimate of the theta of the option can be obtained from the values at nodes D and C as
3.77-4.49
0.1667=-4.3     per year
or -0.012 per calendar day. These are only rough estimates. They become pro-
gressively better as the number of time steps on the tree is increased. Using 50 time  
steps, DerivaGem provides estimates of -0.415, 0.034, and -0.0117 for delta, 
gamma, and theta, respectively. By making small changes to parameters and recomputing values, vega and rho are estimated as 0.123 and 
-0.072, respectively.
5 If slightly more accuracy is required for delta and gamma, we can start the binomial tree at time -2∆t and 
assume that the stock price is S0 at this time. This leads to the option price being calculated for three different 
stock prices at time zero.
M21_HULL0654_11_GE_C21.indd   477 30/04/2021   17:36478 CHAPTER 21
As explained in Chapters 13, 17 and 18, stock indices, currencies, and futures contracts 
can, for the purposes of option valuation, be considered as assets providing known yields. For a stock index, the relevant yield is the dividend yield on the stock portfolio underlying the index; in the case of a currency, it is the foreign risk-free interest rate; in the  
case of a futures contract, it is the domestic risk-free interest rate. The binomial tree approach can therefore be used to value options on stock indices, currencies, and futures  
contracts provided that q in equation (21.7) is interpreted appropriately.
Example 21.3
Consider a 4-month American call option on index futures where the current 
futures price is 300, the exercise price is 300, the risk-free interest rate is 8% per 21.2 USING THE BINOMIAL TREE FOR OPTIONS ON INDICES,

annum, and the volatility of the index is 30% per annum. The life of the option is 
divided into four 1-month periods for the purposes of constructing the tree. In this case, 
F0=300, K=300, r=0.08, s=0.3, T=0.3333, and ∆t=0.0833. Because 
a futures contract is analogous to a stock paying dividends at a rate r, q should be 
set equal to r in equation (21.7). This gives a=1. The other parameters necessary 
to construct the tree are
u=es2∆t=1.0905, d=1>u=0.9170
p=a-d
u-d=0.4784, 1-p=0.5216
The tree, as produced by DerivaGem, is shown in Figure 21. 5. (The upper number 
is the futures price; the lower number is the option price.) The estimated value of  
the option is 19.16. More accuracy is obtained using more steps. With 50 time  
steps, DerivaGem gives a value of 20.18; with 100 time steps it gives 20.22.

Example 21.4
Consider a 1-year American put option on a foreign currency. The cur-
rent exchange rate is 1.6100, the strike price is 1.6000, the domestic risk-free  
interest rate is 8% per annum, the foreign risk-free interest rate is 9% per annum,  
and the volatility of the foreign exchange rate is 12% per annum. In this case,  
S0=1.61, K=1.60, r=0.08, rf=0.09, s=0.12, and T=1.0. The life of the 
option is divided into four 3-month periods for the purposes of constructing the tree, so that 
∆t=0.25. In this case, q=rf and equation (21.7) gives
a=e10.08-0.092*0.25=0.9975
The other parameters necessary to construct the tree are
u=es2∆t=1.0618, d=1>u=0.9418, p=a-d
u-d=0.4642, 1-p=0.5358
The tree, as produced by DerivaGem, is shown in Figure 21. 6. (The upper number 
is the exchange rate; the lower number is the option price.) The estimated value of  
the option is $0.0710. (Using 50 time steps, DerivaGem gives the value of the option as 0.0738; with 100 time steps it also gives 0.0738.)
We now move on to the more tricky issue of how the binomial model can be used for a dividend-paying stock. As in Chapter 15, the word “dividend” will, for the purposes of our discussion, be used to refer to the reduction in the stock price on the ex-dividend date as a result of the dividend.
Known Dividend Yield
For long-life stock options, it is sometimes assumed for convenience that there is a known continuous dividend yield of q on the stock. The options can then be valued in the same way as options on a stock index.
For more accuracy, known dividend yields can be assumed to be paid discretely. 
Suppose that there is a single dividend, and the dividend yield (i.e., the dividend as a percentage of the stock price) is known. The parameters u , d, and p  can be calculated as  
though no dividends are expected. If the time 
i ∆t is prior to the stock going ex- 
dividend, the nodes on the tree correspond to stock prices
S0ujdi-j, j=0, 1, c, i
If the time i ∆t is after the stock goes ex-dividend, the nodes correspond to stock prices
S011-d2ujdi-j, j=0, 1, c, i
where d is the dividend yield. The tree has the form shown in Figure 21.7. Several known  
dividend yields during the life of an option can be dealt with similarly. If di is the total 
dividend yield associated with all ex-dividend dates between time zero and time i ∆t, the  
nodes at time i ∆t correspond to stock prices

Known Dollar Dividend
In some situations, particularly when the life of the option is short, the most realistic 
assumption is that the dollar amount of the dividend rather than the dividend yield is known in advance. If the volatility of the stock, 
s, is assumed constant, the tree then 
takes the form shown in Figure 21.8. It does not recombine, which means that the  
number of nodes that have to be evaluated is liable to become very large. Suppose that there is only one dividend, that the ex-dividend date, 
t, is between k ∆t and 1k+12∆t, 
and that the dollar amount of the dividend is D. When i…k, the nodes on the tree at 
time i ∆t correspond to stock prices
S0ujdi-j, j=0, 1, 2, c, i
as before. When i=k+1, the nodes on the tree correspond to stock prices
S0ujdi-j-D, j=0, 1, 2, c, i
When i=k+2, so that the nodes on the tree correspond to stock prices
1S0ujdi-1-j-D2u and 1S0ujdi-1-j-D2d
for j=0, 1, 2, c, i-1, there are 2i rather than i+1 nodes. When i=k+m,  
there are m1k+22 rather than k+m+1 nodes. The number of nodes expands even 
faster when there are several ex-dividend dates during the option’s life.Figure 21.7 Tree when stock pays a known dividend yield at one particular time.

Section 15.12 explained that European options on dividend-paying stocks are valued 
by assuming that the stock price has two components: a part that is uncertain and a part 
that is the present value of dividends paid during the life of the option. It outlined a number of reasons why practitioners find this a sensible assumption. American options clearly have to be valued using the same model as European options. (Otherwise the prices of American options that should never be exercised early will not be the same as the prices of European options.) American options on stocks paying known dividends are therefore in practice valued using the approach in Section 15.12. As it happens, this solves the node-proliferation problem in Figure 21.8.
Suppose that there is only one ex-dividend date, 
t, during the life of the option and that 
k ∆t…t…1k+12∆t. The value S* of the uncertain component (i.e., the component not  
used to pay dividends) at time i ∆t is given by
S*=S when i ∆t7t
and
S*=S-De-r1t-i∆t2 when i ∆t…t
where D is the dividend. Define s* as the volatility of S* The parameters p, u, and d  
can be calculated from equations (21.4) to (21.7) with s replaced by s* and a tree can be  
constructed in the usual way to model S*.6 By adding to the stock price at each node, 
the present value of future dividends (if any), the tree can be converted into another tree Figure 21.8 Tree when dollar amount of dividend is assumed known and volatility is 
assumed constant.

6 As discussed in Section 15. 12, the difference between s and s* does not usually have to be considered 
explicitly because in practice analysts normally work with volatilities implied from market prices using their 
models and these are s*-volatilities.
M21_HULL0654_11_GE_C21.indd   482 30/04/2021   17:36Basic Numerical Procedures 483
that models S. Suppose that S0* is the value of S* at time zero. At time i ∆t, the nodes  
on this tree correspond to the stock prices
S0*ujdi-j+De-r1t-i ∆t2, j=0, 1, c, i
when i ∆t6t and
S0*ujdi-j, j=0, 1, c, i
when i ∆t7t. This approach, which leads to a situation where the tree recombines so 
that there are i+1 nodes at time i ∆t, can be generalized in a straightforward way to 
deal with the situation where there are several dividends.
Example 21.5
Consider a 5-month American put option on a stock that is expected to pay a 
single dividend of $2.06 during the life of the option. The initial stock price is $52, the strike price is $50, the risk-free interest rate is 10% per annum, the volatility is  
40% per annum, and the ex-dividend date is in 
31
2 months.
We first construct a tree to model S*, the stock price less the present value of 
future dividends during the life of the option. At time zero, the present value of the dividend is
2.06*e-0.2917*0.1=2.00
The initial value of S* is therefore 50.00. If we assume that the 40% per annum 
volatility refers to S*, then Figure 21. 3 provides a binomial tree for S*. (This is  
because S* has the same initial value and volatility as the stock price that  
Figure 21.3 was based upon.) Adding the present value of the dividend at each 
node leads to Figure 21.9, which is a binomial model for S. The probabilities at 
each node are, as in Figure 21.3, 0.5073 for an up movement and 0.4927 for a  
down movement. Working back through the tree in the usual way gives the  
option price as $4.44. (Using 50 time steps, DerivaGem gives a value for the  
option of 4.208; using 100 steps it gives 4.214.)
Control Variate Technique
A technique known as the control variate technique can improve the accuracy of the pricing of an American option.
7 This involves using the same tree to calculate the value  
of both the American option, fA, and the corresponding European option, fE. The 
Black–Scholes–Merton price of the European option, fBSM, is also calculated. The  
error when the tree is used to price the European option, fBSM-fE, is assumed equal 
to the error when the tree is used to price the American option. This gives the estimate of the price of the American option as
fA+1fBSM-fE2
To illustrate this approach, Figure 21.10 values the option in Figure 21.3 on the assumption that it is European. The price obtained, 
fE, is $4.32. From the Black–  
Scholes–Merton formula, the true European price of the option, fBSM, is $4.08. The 
7 See J. C. Hull and A. White, “The Use of the Control Variate Technique in Option Pricing, ” Journal of  
Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 23 (September 1988): 237–51.
M21_HULL0654_11_GE_C21.indd   483 30/04/2021   17:36484 CHAPTER 21
estimate of the American price in Figure 21.3, fA, is $4.49. The control variate estimate 
of the American price, therefore, is
4.49+14.08-4.322=4.25
A good estimate of the American price, calculated using 100 steps, is 4.278. The control 
variate approach does, therefore, produce a considerable improvement over the basic tree estimate of 4.49 in this case.
The control variate technique in effect involves using the tree to calculate the  
difference between the European and the American price rather than the American price itself. We give a further application of the control variate technique when we  
discuss Monte Carlo simulation later in the chapter.Figure 21.9 Tree produced by DerivaGem for Example 21.5.

The Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein approach described so far is not the only way of  
building a binomial tree. The change in ln S in time ∆t in a risk-neutral world has mean 
1r-q-s2>22 ∆ t and standard deviation s2∆t. These can be matched by setting 
p=0.5 and
u=e1r-q-s2>22∆ t+s2∆t,  d=e1r-q-s2>22 ∆ t-s2∆t
This alternative tree-building procedure has the advantage over the Cox, Ross, and 21.4 ALTERNATIVE PROCEDURES FOR CONSTRUCTING TREES

Rubinstein approach that the probabilities are always 0.5 regardless of the value of σ or  
the number of time steps.8 Its disadvantage is that it is not quite as straightforward to 
calculate delta, gamma, and theta from the tree because the tree is no longer centered at  
the initial stock price.
Example 21.6
Consider a 9-month American call option on a foreign currency. The foreign  
currency is worth 0.7900 when measured in the domestic currency, the strike price 
is 0.7950, the domestic risk-free interest rate is 6% per annum, the foreign risk-free  
interest rate is 10% per annum, and the volatility of the exchange rate is 4% per  
annum. In this case, S0=0.79, K=0.795, r=0.06, rf=0.10, s=0.04, and 
8 When time steps are so large that s6∙1r-q22∆t∙, the Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein tree gives negative 
probabilities. The alternative procedure described here does not have that drawback.Figure 21.11 Binomial tree for American call option on a foreign currency. At

T=0.75. Using the alternative tree-building procedure, we set ∆t=0.25 (3 steps)  
and the probabilities on each branch to 0.5, so that
 u=e10.06-0.10-0.0016>220.25+0.0420.25=1.0098
 d=e10.06-0.10-0.0016>220.25-0.0420.25=0.9703
The tree for the exchange rate is shown in Figure 21. 11. The tree gives the value of  
the option as $0.0026.
Trinomial Trees
Trinomial trees can be used as an alternative to binomial trees. The general form of the  
tree is as shown in Figure 21.12. Suppose that pu, pm, and pd are the probabilities of  
up, middle, and down movements at each node and ∆t is the length of the time step. 
For an asset paying dividends at a rate q, parameter values that match the mean and 
standard deviation of changes in ln S are
u=es23∆t, d=1>u

Calculations for a trinomial tree are analogous to those for a binomial tree. We work from the end of the tree to the beginning. At each node we calculate the value of

e-r∆t1pufu+pmfm+pdfd2
where fu, fm, and fd are the values of the option at the subsequent up, middle, and  
down nodes, respectively. The trinomial tree approach proves to be equivalent to the 
explicit finite difference method, which will be described in Section 21.8.
Figlewski and Gao have proposed an enhancement of the trinomial tree method, 
which they call the adaptive mesh model. In this, a high-resolution (small- ∆t) tree is  
grafted onto a low-resolution (large- ∆t) tree.9 When valuing a regular American  
option, high resolution is most useful for the parts of the tree close to the strike price at the end of the life of the option.
9 See S. Figlewski and B. Gao, “The Adaptive Mesh Model: A New Approach to Efficient Option Pricing, ” 
Journal of Financial Economics, 53 (1999): 313–51.
10 The forward dividend yield and forward variance rate are calculated in the same way as the forward  
interest rate. (The variance rate is the square of the volatility.)
11 For a sufficiently large number of time steps, these probabilities are always positive.Up to now we have assumed that r, q, rf, and s are constants. In practice, they are  
usually assumed to be time dependent. The values of these variables between times t  
and t+∆t are assumed to be equal to their forward values.10
To make r and q (or rf) a function of time in a Cox–Ross–Rubinstein binomial tree, 
we set
 a=e3f1t2-g1t24∆t (21.11)
for nodes at time t, where f 1t2 is the forward interest rate between times t and t+∆t 
and g(t) is the forward value of q (or rf) between these times. This does not change the  
geometry of the tree because u and d do not depend on a. The probabilities on the 
branches emanating from nodes at time t are:11
 p=e3f1t2-g1t24∆ t-d
u-d (21.12)
1-p=u-e3f1t2-g1t24∆ t
u-d
The rest of the way that we use the tree is the same as before, except that when  
discounting between times t and t+∆t we use f1t2.
Making the volatility, s, a function of time in a binomial tree is more difficult. Suppose  
s(t) is the volatility used to price an option with maturity t. One approach is to make the length of each time step inversely proportional to the average variance rate during the time step. The values of u and d are then the same everywhere and the tree recombines. 
Define the 
V=s1T22T, where T is the life of the tree, and define ti as the end of the ith 
time step. For N time steps, we choose ti to satisfy s1ti22ti=iV>N and set u=e2V>N 
with d=1>u. The parameter p is defined in terms of u, d, r, and q as for a constant  
 volatility. This procedure can be combined with the procedure just mentioned for dealing 21.5 TIME-DEPENDENT PARAMETERS
M21_HULL0654_11_GE_C21.indd   488 30/04/2021   17:37Basic Numerical Procedures 489
with nonconstant interest rates so that both interest rates and volatilities are time- 
dependent.Business Snapshot 21.1 Calculating Pi with Monte Carlo Simulation
Suppose the sides of the square in Figure 21.13 are one unit in length. Imagine that 
you fire darts randomly at the square and calculate the percentage that lie in the circle. What should you find? The square has an area of 1.0 and the circle has a radius of 0.5 The area of the circle is 
p times the radius squared or p>4. It follows that 
the proportion of darts that lie in the circle should be p>4. We can estimate p by  
multiplying the proportion that lie in the circle by 4.
We can use an Excel spreadsheet to simulate the dart throwing as illustrated in 
Table 21.1. We define both cell A1 and cell B1 as =RAND( ). A1 and B1 are random 
numbers between 0 and 1 and define how far to the right and how high up the dart lands in the square in Figure 21. 13. We then define cell C1 as
=IF1(A1-0.52n2+1B1-0.52n260.5n2,4,02
This has the effect of setting C1 equal to 4 if the dart lies in the circle and 0 otherwise.
Define the next 99 rows of the spreadsheet similarly to the first one. (This is a 
“select and drag” operation in Excel.) Define C102 as =AVERAGE(C1:C100) and 
C103 as =STDEV(C1:C100). C102 (which is 3.04 in Table 21. 1) is an estimate of p 
calculated from 100 random trials. C103 is the standard deviation of our results and as we will see in Example 21. 7 can be used to assess the accuracy of the estimate. 
Increasing the number of trials improves accuracy—but convergence to the correct value of 3.14159 is slow.
We now explain Monte Carlo simulation, a quite different approach for valuing  
derivatives from binomial trees. Business Snapshot 21.1 illustrates the random sampling  
idea underlying Monte Carlo simulation by showing how a simple Excel program can be constructed to estimate 
p.
When used to value an option, Monte Carlo simulation uses the risk-neutral  
valuation result. We sample paths to obtain the expected payoff in a risk-neutral world 21.6 MONTE CARLO SIMULATION

M21_HULL0654_11_GE_C21.indd   489 30/04/2021   17:37490 CHAPTER 21
and then discount this payoff at the risk-free rate. Consider a derivative dependent on a 
single market variable S that provides a payoff at time T. Assuming that interest rates are constant, we can value the derivative as follows:
1. Sample a random path for S in a risk-neutral world.
2. Calculate the payoff from the derivative.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 to get many sample values of the payoff from the derivative 
in a risk-neutral world.
4. Calculate the mean of the sample payoffs to get an estimate of the expected payoff in a risk-neutral world.
5. Discount this expected payoff at the risk-free rate to get an estimate of the value of  
the derivative.
This is illustrated by the Monte Carlo worksheet in DerivaGem.
Suppose that the process followed by the underlying market variable in a risk-neutral 
world is
 
dS=mnS dt+sS dz (21.13)
where dz is a Wiener process, mn is the expected return in a risk-neutral world, and s is  
the volatility.12 To simulate the path followed by S, we can divide the life of the  
derivative into N short intervals of length ∆t and approximate equation (21.13) as
 S1t+∆t2-S1t2=mnS1t2∆t+sS1t2P2∆t (21.14)
where S1t2 denotes the value of S at time t, P is a random sample from a normal  
distribution with mean zero and standard deviation of 1.0. This enables the value of S  
at time ∆t to be calculated from the initial value of S, the value at time 2 ∆t to be  
calculated from the value at time ∆t, and so on. An illustration of the procedure is in 
Section 14.3. One simulation trial involves constructing a complete path for S using N 
random samples from a normal distribution.A B C

12 If S is the price of a non-dividend-paying stock then mn=r, if it is an exchange rate then mn=r-rf, and  
so on. Note that the volatility is the same in a risk-neutral world as in the real world, as explained in  
Section 13.7.

S1t+∆t2=S1t2expcamn-s2
2b∆t+sP2∆td (21.16)
This equation is used to construct a path for S.
Working with ln S rather than S gives more accuracy. Also, if mn and s are constant,  
then
ln S1T2-ln S102=amn-s2
2bT+sP2T
is true for all T.13 It follows that
 S1T2=S102expcamn-s2
2bT+sP2Td (21.17)
This equation can be used to value derivatives that provide a nonstandard payoff at  
time T. As shown in Business Snapshot 21.2, it can also be used to check the Black– 
Scholes–Merton formulas.
The key advantage of Monte Carlo simulation is that it can be used when the  
payoff depends on the path followed by the underlying variable S as well as when it  
depends only on the final value of S. (For example, it can be used when payoffs  
depend on the average value of S between time 0 and time T.) Payoffs can occur at 
several times during the life of the derivative rather than all at the end. Any stochastic 
process for S can be accommodated. As will be shown shortly, the procedure can also be extended to accommodate situations where the payoff from the derivative depends on several underlying market variables. The drawbacks of Monte Carlo simulation are  
that it is computationally very time consuming and cannot easily handle situations where there are early exercise opportunities.

Derivatives Dependent on More than One Market Variable
We discussed correlated stochastic processes in Section 14.5. Consider the situation where the payoff from a derivative depends on n  variables 
ui 11…i…n2. Define si as the 
volatility of ui, mni as the expected growth rate of ui in a risk-neutral world, and rik as the 
correlation between the Wiener processes driving ui and uk.15 As in the single-variable 
case, the life of the derivative must be divided into N subintervals of length ∆t. The 
13 By contrast, equation (21. 14) is exactly true only in the limit as ∆t tends to zero.
14 As discussed in Chapter 27 , a number of researchers have suggested ways Monte Carlo simulation can be 
extended to value American options.
15 Note that si, mni, and rik are not necessarily constant; they may depend on the ui.
M21_HULL0654_11_GE_C21.indd   491 30/04/2021   17:37492 CHAPTER 21
discrete version of the process for ui is then
 ui1t+∆t2-ui1t2=mniui1t2 ∆t+siui1t2Pi2∆t (21.18)
where Pi is a random sample from a standard normal distribution. The coefficient of  
correlation between Pi and Pk is rik 11…i; k…n2. One simulation trial involves obtain-
ing N samples of the Pi 11…i…n2 from a multivariate standardized normal distribu-
tion. These are substituted into equation (21.18) to produce simulated paths for each ui, 
thereby enabling a sample value for the derivative to be calculated.Business Snapshot 21.2 Checking Black–Scholes–Merton in Excel
The Black–Scholes–Merton formula for a European call option can be checked by 
using a binomial tree with a very large number of time steps. An alternative way of checking it is to use Monte Carlo simulation. Table 21. 2 shows a spreadsheet that can  
be constructed. The cells C2, D2, E2, F2, and G2 contain 
S0, K, r, s, and T , respectively. 
Cells D4, E4, and F4 calculate d1, d2, and the Black–Scholes–Merton price, respec-
tively. (The Black–Scholes–Merton price is 4.817 in the sample spreadsheet.)
NORMSINV is the inverse cumulative function for the standard normal distribu-
tion. It follows that NORMSINV(RAND()) gives a random sample from a standard normal distribution. We set cell A1 as
=$C$2*EXP(($E$2 -$F$2*$F$2/2)*$G$2 +$F$2*NORMSINV(RAND( ))*SQRT($G$2))
This corresponds to equation (21.17) and is a random sample from the set of all stock 
prices at time T. We set cell B1 as
=EXP1-+E+2*+G+22*MAX1A1-+D+2,02
This is the present value of the payoff from a call option. We define the next 999 rows of the spreadsheet similarly to the first one. (This is a “select and drag” operation in Excel.) Define B1002 as A VERAGE(B1:B1000), which is 4.98 in the sample spread-sheet. This is an estimate of the value of the option and should be not too far from the Black–Scholes–Merton price. B1003 is defined as STDEV(B1:B1000). As we shall see in Example 21. 8, it can be used to assess the accuracy of the estimate.

Generating the Random Samples from Normal Distributions
The instruction =NORMSINV1RAND1 22 in Excel can be used to generate a random  
sample from a standard normal distribution, as in Business Snapshot 21.2. When two 
correlated samples P1 and P2 from standard normal distributions are required, an  
appropriate procedure is as follows. Independent samples x1 and x2 from a univariate 
standardized normal distribution are obtained as just described. The required samples 
P1 and P2 are then calculated as follows:
 P1=x1
 P2=rx1+x221-r2
where r is the coefficient of correlation.
More generally, consider the situation where we require n correlated samples from 
normal distributions with the correlation between sample i and sample j being rij. We 
first sample n independent variables xi 11…i…n2, from univariate standardized  
normal distributions. The required samples, Pi 11…i…n2, are then defined as follows:
 P1=a11x1
 P2=a21x1+a22x2
  P3=a31x1+a32x2+a33x3 (21.19)
and so on. We choose the coefficients aij so that the correlations and variances are  
correct. This can be done step by step as follows. Set a11=1; choose a21 so that 
a21a11=r21; choose a22 so that a2
21+a222=1; choose a31 so that a31a11=r31; choose 
a32 so that a31a21+a32a22=r32; choose a33 so that a2
31+a232+a233=1; and so on.16 
This procedure is known as the Cholesky decomposition.
Number of Trials
The accuracy of the result given by Monte Carlo simulation depends on the number of  
trials. It is usual to calculate the standard deviation as well as the mean of the  
discounted payoffs given by the simulation trials. Denote the mean by m and the  
standard deviation by v. The variable m is the simulation’s estimate of the value of  
the derivative. The standard error of the estimate is
v
2M
where M is the number of trials. A 95% confidence interval for the price f of the  
derivative is therefore given by
m-1.96v
2M6f6m+1.96v
2M
This shows that uncertainty about the value of the derivative is inversely proportional to the square root of the number of trials. To double the accuracy of a simulation, we 
16 If the equations for the a’s do not have real solutions, the assumed correlation structure is internally  
inconsistent This will be discussed further in Section 23.7.

must quadruple the number of trials; to increase the accuracy by a factor of 10, the 
number of trials must increase by a factor of 100; and so on.
Example 21.7
In Table 21.1, p is calculated as the average of 100 numbers. The standard  
deviation of the numbers is 1.69. In this case, v=1.69 and M=100, so that 
the standard error of the estimate is 1.69>2100=0.169. The spreadsheet  
therefore gives a 95% confidence interval for p as 13.04-1.96*0.1692 to 
13.04+1.96*0.1692 or 2.71 to 3.37. (The correct value of 3.14159 lies within  
this confidence interval.)
Example 21.8
In Table 21.2, the value of the option is calculated as the average of 1000  
numbers. The standard deviation of the numbers is 7.68. In this case, v=7.68  
and M=1000. The standard error of the estimate is 7.68>21000=0.24. The 
spreadsheet therefore gives a 95% confidence interval for the option value as 
14.98-1.96*0.242 to 14.98+1.96*0.242, or 4.51 to 5.45. (The Black–Scholes–  
Merton price, 4.817, lies within this confidence interval.)
Sampling through a Tree
Instead of implementing Monte Carlo simulation by randomly sampling from the  
stochastic process for an underlying variable, we can use an N-step binomial tree and 
sample from the 2N paths that are possible. Suppose we have a binomial tree where the 
probability of an “up” movement is 0.6. The procedure for sampling a random path 
through the tree is as follows. At each node, we sample a random number between 0 and 1. If the number is less than 0.4, we take the down branch. If it is greater than 0.4, we take the up branch. Once we have a complete path from the initial node to the end of the tree, we can calculate a payoff. This completes the first trial. A similar procedure is  
used to complete more trials. The mean of the payoffs is discounted at the risk-free rate to get an estimate of the value of the derivative.
17
Example 21.9
Suppose that the tree in Figure 21.3 is used to value an option that pays off  
max 1Save-50, 02, where Save is the average stock price during the 5 months (with 
the first and last stock price being included in the average). This is known as an Asian option. When ten simulation trials are used one possible result is shown in Table 21.3. The value of the option is calculated as the average payoff discounted at  
the risk-free rate. In this case, the average payoff is $7.08 and the risk-free rate is  
10% and so the calculated value is 
7.08e-0.1*5>12=6.79. (This illustrates the 
methodology. In practice, we would have to use more time steps on the tree and many more simulation trials to get an accurate answer.)
Calculating the Greek Letters
The Greek letters discussed in Chapter 19 can be calculated using Monte Carlo  
simulation. Suppose that we are interested in the partial derivative of f with respect  
17 See D. Mintz, “Less is More, ” Risk, July 1997: 42–45, for a discussion of how sampling through a tree can  
be made efficient.
M21_HULL0654_11_GE_C21.indd   494 30/04/2021   17:37Basic Numerical Procedures 495
to x, where f is the value of the derivative and x is the value of an underlying variable 
or a parameter. First, Monte Carlo simulation is used in the usual way to calculate an 
estimate fn for the value of the derivative. A small increase ∆x is then made in the value  
of x, and a new value for the derivative, fn*, is calculated in the same way as fn. An  
estimate for the hedge parameter is given by
fn*-fn
∆x
In order to minimize the standard error of the estimate, the number of time intervals, N ,  
the random samples that are used, and the number of trials, M, should be the same for calculating both 
fn and fn*.
Applications
Monte Carlo simulation tends to be numerically more efficient than other procedures when there are three or more stochastic variables. This is because the time taken to  
carry out a Monte Carlo simulation increases approximately linearly with the number of variables, whereas the time taken for most other procedures increases exponentially  
with the number of variables. One advantage of Monte Carlo simulation is that it can  
provide a standard error for the estimates that it makes. Another is that it is an  
approach that can accommodate complex payoffs and complex stochastic processes. Also, it can be used when the payoff depends on some function of the whole path  
followed by a variable, not just its terminal value.Trial Path Average stock price Option payoff

If the stochastic processes for the variables underlying a derivative are simulated as  
indicated in equations (21.13) to (21.18), a very large number of trials is usually  21.7 VARIANCE REDUCTION PROCEDURES
M21_HULL0654_11_GE_C21.indd   495 30/04/2021   17:37496 CHAPTER 21
necessary to estimate the value of the derivative with reasonable accuracy. This is very  
expensive in terms of computation time. In this section, we examine a number of  
variance reduction procedures that can lead to dramatic savings in computation time.
Antithetic Variable Technique
In the antithetic variable technique, a simulation trial involves calculating two values of  
the derivative. The first value f1 is calculated in the usual way; the second value f2 is  
calculated by changing the sign of all the random samples from standard normal  
distributions. (If P is a sample used to calculate f1, then -P is the corresponding sample 
used to calculate f2.) The sample value of the derivative calculated from a simulation 
trial is the average of f1 and f2. This works well because when f1 is above the true  
value, f2 tends to be below, and vice versa.
Denote f as the average of f1 and f2:
f=f1+f2
2
The final estimate of the value of the derivative is the average of the f’s. If v- is the 
standard deviation of the f’s, and M is the number of simulation trials (i.e., the number 
of pairs of values calculated), then the standard error of the estimate is
v->2M
This is usually much less than the standard error calculated using 2M random trials.
Control Variate Technique
We have already given one example of the control variate technique in connection with  
the use of trees to value American options (see Section 21.3). The control variate  
technique is applicable when there are two similar derivatives, A and B. Derivative A is 
the one being valued; derivative B is similar to derivative A and has an analytic solution available. Two simulations using the same random number streams and the same 
∆t are  
carried out in parallel. The first is used to obtain an estimate f*
A of the value of A; the 
second is used to obtain an estimate f*
B, of the value of B. A better estimate fA of the 
value of A is then obtained using the formula
 fA=f*
A-f*
B+fB (21.20)
where fB is the known true value of B calculated analytically. Hull and White provide 
an example of the use of the control variate technique when evaluating the effect of 
stochastic volatility on the price of a European call option.18 In this case, A is the  
option assuming stochastic volatility and B is the option assuming constant volatility.
Importance Sampling
Importance sampling is best explained with an example. Suppose that we wish to  
calculate the price of a deep-out-of-the-money European call option with strike  
18 See J. C. Hull and A. White, “The Pricing of Options on Assets with Stochastic Volatilities, ” Journal of 
Finance, 42 (June 1987): 281 –300.
M21_HULL0654_11_GE_C21.indd   496 30/04/2021   17:37Basic Numerical Procedures 497
price K and maturity T . If we sample values for the underlying asset price at time T  in the 
usual way, most of the paths will lead to zero payoff. This is a waste of computation time 
because the zero-payoff paths contribute very little to the determination of the value of the option. We therefore try to choose only important paths, that is, paths where the stock price is above K at maturity.
Suppose F is the unconditional probability distribution function for the stock price 
at time T and q, the probability of the stock price being greater than K at maturity, is  
known analytically. Then 
G=F>q is the probability distribution of the stock price 
conditional on the stock price being greater than K. To implement importance  
sampling, we sample from G rather than F. The estimate of the value of the option  
is the average discounted payoff multiplied by q.
Stratified Sampling
Sampling representative values rather than random values from a probability distribu -
tion usually gives more accuracy. Stratified sampling is a way of doing this. Suppose we  
wish to take 1000 samples from a probability distribution. We would divide the  
distribution into 1000 equally likely intervals and choose a representative value  
(typically the mean or median) for each interval.
In the case of a standard normal distribution when there are n intervals, we can 
calculate the representative value for the ith interval as
N-1 ai-0.5
nb
where N-1 is the inverse cumulative normal distribution. For example, when n=4 the 
representative values corresponding to the four intervals are N-110.1252, N-110.3752,
N-110.6252, N-110.8752. The function N-1 can be calculated using the NORMSINV 
function in Excel.
Moment Matching
Moment matching involves adjusting the samples taken from a standardized normal  
distribution so that the first, second, and possibly higher moments are matched.  
Suppose that we sample from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard  
deviation 1 to calculate the change in the value of a particular variable over a particular  
time period. Suppose that the samples are Pi 11…i…n2. To match the first two 
moments, we calculate the mean of the samples, m, and the standard deviation of  
the samples, s. We then define adjusted samples P*i 11…i…n2 as
P*i=Pi-m
s
These adjusted samples have the correct mean of 0 and the correct standard deviation of 1.0. We use the adjusted samples for all calculations.
Moment matching saves computation time, but can lead to memory problems 
because every number sampled must be stored until the end of the simulation. Moment matching is sometimes termed quadratic resampling. It is often used in conjunction with  
the antithetic variable technique. Because the latter automatically matches all odd  
M21_HULL0654_11_GE_C21.indd   497 30/04/2021   17:37498 CHAPTER 21
moments, the goal of moment matching then becomes that of matching the second 
moment and, possibly, the fourth moment.
Using Quasi-Random Sequences
A quasi-random sequence (also called a low-discrepancy sequence) is a sequence of representative samples from a probability distribution.
19 Descriptions of the use of  
quasi-random sequences appear in Brotherton-Ratcliffe, and Press et al.20 Quasi-random  
sequences can have the desirable property that they lead to the standard error of an estimate being proportional to 
1>M rather than 1>2M, where M is the sample size.
Quasi-random sampling is similar to stratified sampling. The objective is to sample 
representative values for the underlying variables. In stratified sampling, it is assumed that we know in advance how many samples will be taken. A quasi-random sampling procedure is more flexible. The samples are taken in such a way that we are always “filling in” gaps between existing samples. At each stage of the simulation, the sampled points are roughly evenly spaced throughout the probability space.
Figure 21.14 shows points generated in two dimensions using a procedure by Sobol’.
21 
It can be seen that successive points do tend to fill in the gaps left by previous points.
19 The term quasi-random is a misnomer. A quasi-random sequence is totally deterministic.

derivative satisfies. The differential equation is converted into a set of difference  
equations, and the difference equations are solved iteratively.
To illustrate the approach, we consider how it might be used to value an American 
put option on a stock paying a dividend yield of q. The differential equation that the option must satisfy is, from equation (17.6),

of length ∆t=T>N. A total of N+1 times are therefore considered
0, ∆t, 2 ∆t, c, T
Suppose that Smax is a stock price sufficiently high that, when it is reached, the put has 
virtually no value. We define ∆S=Smax>M and consider a total of M+1 equally 
spaced stock prices:
0, ∆S, 2 ∆S, c, Smax
The level Smax is chosen so that one of these is the current stock price.21.8 FINITE DIFFERENCE METHODS
M21_HULL0654_11_GE_C21.indd   498 30/04/2021   17:37Basic Numerical Procedures 499
The time points and stock price points define a grid consisting of a total of 
1M+121N+12 points, as shown in Figure 21.15. We define the 1i, j2 point on the grid  
as the point that corresponds to time i ∆t and stock price j ∆S. We will use the variable 
fi, j to denote the value of the option at the 1i, j2 point.

Hence,

The value of the put option when the stock price is zero is K. Hence,
 fi, 0=K, i=0, 1, c, N (21.29)
We assume that the put option is worth zero when S=Smax, so that
 fi, M=0, i=0, 1, c, N (21.30)
Equations (21.28), (21.29), and (21.30) define the value of the put option along the  
three edges of the grid in Figure 21.15, where S=0, S=Smax, and t=T. It remains to  
use equation (21.27) to arrive at the value of f at all other points. First the points  
corresponding to time T-∆t are tackled. Equation (21.27) with i=N-1 gives

Equations (21.31) are therefore M-1 simultaneous equations that can be solved for the  
M-1 unknowns: fN-1, 1, fN-1, 2, c, fN-1, M-1.22 After this has been done, each value 
22 This does not involve inverting a matrix. The j=1 equation in (21.31) can be used to express fN-1, 2 in  
terms of fN-1, 1; the j=2 equation, when combined with the j=1 equation, can be used to express fN-1, 3 in 
terms of fN-1, 1; and so on. The j=M-2 equation, together with earlier equations, enables fN-1, M-1 to be 
expressed in terms of fN-1, 1. The final j=M-1 equation can then be solved for fN-1, 1, which can then be 
used to determine the other fN-1, j.

of fN-1, j is compared with K-j ∆S. If fN-1, j6K-j ∆S, early exercise at time 
T-∆t is optimal and fN-1, j is set equal to K-j ∆S. The nodes corresponding to  
time T-2 ∆t are handled in a similar way, and so on. Eventually, f0, 1, f0, 2, f0, 3, c,
f0, M-1 are obtained. One of these is the option price of interest.
The control variate technique can be used in conjunction with finite difference  
methods. The same grid is used to value an option similar to the one under  
consideration but for which an analytic valuation is available. Equation (21.20) is  
then used.
Example 21.10
Table 21.4 shows the result of using the implicit finite difference method as just 
described for pricing the American put option in Example 21.1. Values of 20, 10,  
and 5 were chosen for M, N, and ∆S, respectively. Thus, the option price is  
evaluated at $5 stock price intervals between $0 and $100 and at half-month time 
intervals throughout the life of the option. The option price given by the grid is $4.07. The same grid gives the price of the corresponding European option as $3.91. The true European price given by the Black–Scholes–Merton formula is $4.08. The control variate estimate of the American price is therefore
4.07+14.08-3.912=+4.24
Explicit Finite Difference Method
The implicit finite difference method has the advantage of being very robust. It always converges to the solution of the differential equation as 
∆S and ∆t approach zero.23 One 
of the disadvantages of the implicit finite difference method is that M-1 simultaneous 
equations have to be solved in order to calculate the  fi, j from the fi+1, j. The method can  
be simplified if the values of 0f>0S and 02f>0S2 at point 1i, j2 on the grid are assumed to  
be the same as at point 1i+1, j2. Equations (21.24) and (21.26) then become

 02f
0S2=fi+1, j+1+fi+1, j-1-2fi+1, j

23 A general rule in finite difference methods is that ∆S should be kept proportional to 2∆t as they approach 
zero.

Example 21.11
Table 21.5 shows the result of using the explicit version of the finite difference 
method for pricing the American put option described in Example 21.1. As in 
Example 21.10, values of 20, 10, and 5 were chosen for M , N, and ∆S, respec-
tively. The option price given by the grid is $4.26.25
Change of Variable
When geometric Brownian motion is used for the underlying asset price, it is compu-tationally more efficient to use finite difference methods with ln S rather than S as the underlying variable. Define 
Z=ln S. Equation (21.21) becomes
0f
0t+ar-q-s2
2b 0f
0Z+1
2s2 02f
0Z2=rf
The grid then evaluates the derivative for equally spaced values of Z rather than for equally spaced values of S. The difference equation for the implicit method becomes

Relation to Trinomial Tree Approaches
The explicit finite difference method is equivalent to the trinomial tree approach.26 In 
the expressions for a*
j, b*
j, and c*
j in equation (21.34), we can interpret terms as follows:
-1
21r-q2j ∆t+1
2 s2j2∆t: Probability of stock price decreasing from  
j∆S to 1j-12∆S in time ∆t.
1-s2j2∆t: Probability of stock price remaining unchanged 
at j∆S in time ∆t.
1
21r-q2j ∆t+1
2 s2j2∆t: Probability of stock price increasing from  
j∆S to 1j+12∆S in time ∆t.
This interpretation is illustrated in Figure 21.17. The three probabilities sum to unity. They give the expected increase in the stock price in time 
∆t as 1r-q2j ∆S ∆t =
1r-q2S ∆t. This is the expected increase in a risk-neutral world. For small values  
26 It can also be shown that the implicit finite difference method is equivalent to a multinomial tree approach 
where there are M+1 branches emanating from each node.Figure 21.17 Interpretation of explicit finite difference method as a trinomial tree.

of ∆t, they also give the variance of the change in the stock price in time ∆t as 
s2j2∆S2∆t=s2S2∆t. This corresponds to the stochastic process followed by S. The 
value of f at time i ∆t is calculated as the expected value of f at time 1i+12 ∆t in a 
risk-neutral world discounted at the risk-free rate.

should all be positive. In Example 21.11, 1-s2j2∆t is negative when jÚ13 (i.e., when 
SÚ65). This explains the negative option prices and other inconsistencies in the top 
left-hand part of Table 21.5. This example illustrates the main problem associated with 
the explicit finite difference method. Because the probabilities in the associated tree may be negative, it does not necessarily produce results that converge to the solution of the differential equation.
27
When the change-of-variable approach is used (see equations (21.36) to (21.39)), the 
probability that Z=ln S will decrease by ∆Z, stay the same, and increase by ∆Z are

respectively. These movements in Z correspond to the stock price changing from S to  
Se-∆Z, S, and Se∆Z, respectively. If we set ∆Z=s23∆t, then the tree and the  
probabilities are identical to those for the trinomial tree approach discussed in  
Section 21.4.
Other Finite Difference Methods
Researchers have proposed other finite difference methods which are in many circum-stances more computationally efficient than either the pure explicit or pure implicit method.
In what is known as the hopscotch method, we alternate between the explicit and 
implicit calculations as we move from node to node. This is illustrated in Figure 21.18. At each time, we first do all the calculations at the “explicit nodes” (E) in the usual way.  
The “implicit nodes” (I) can then be handled without solving a set of simultaneous equations because the values at the adjacent nodes have already been calculated.
27 J. C. Hull and A. White, “Valuing Derivative Securities Using the Explicit Finite Difference Method, ”  
Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 25 (March 1990): 87–100, show how this problem can be  
overcome. In the situation considered here it is sufficient to construct the grid in ln S rather than S to ensure 
convergence.
M21_HULL0654_11_GE_C21.indd   507 30/04/2021   17:37508 CHAPTER 21
In the Crank–Nicolson method, the estimate of
fi+1, j-fi, j
∆t
is set equal to an average of that given by the implicit and the explicit methods.
Applications of Finite Difference Methods
Finite difference methods can be used for the same types of derivative pricing problems 
as tree approaches. They can handle American-style as well as European-style deriva-tives but cannot easily be used in situations where the payoff from a derivative depends on the past history of the underlying variable. Finite difference methods can, at the expense of a considerable increase in computer time, be used when there are several state variables. The grid in Figure 21.15 then becomes multidimensional.
The method for calculating Greek letters is similar to that used for trees. Delta, 
gamma, and theta can be calculated directly from the 
fi, j values on the grid. For vega,  
it is necessary to make a small change to volatility and recalculate the value of the derivative using the same grid.
SUMMARY
We have presented three different numerical procedures for valuing derivatives when no  
analytic solution is available. These involve the use of trees, Monte Carlo simulation, and finite difference methods.
Binomial trees assume that, in each short interval of time 
∆t, a stock price either moves 
up by a multiplicative amount u or down by a multiplicative amount d. The sizes of u Figure 21.18 The hopscotch method. I indicates node at which implicit calculations 
are done; E indicates node at which explicit calculations are done.

and d and their associated probabilities are chosen so that the change in the stock price 
has the correct mean and standard deviation in a risk-neutral world. Derivative prices are 
calculated by starting at the end of the tree and working backward. For an American option, the value at a node is the greater of (a) the value if it is exercised immediately and (b) the discounted expected value if it is held for a further period of time 
∆t.
Monte Carlo simulation involves using random numbers to sample many different 
paths that the variables underlying the derivative could follow in a risk-neutral world. For each path, the payoff is calculated and discounted at the risk-free interest rate. The arithmetic average of the discounted payoffs is the estimated value of the derivative.
Finite difference methods solve the underlying differential equation by converting it 
to a difference equation. They are similar to tree approaches in that the computations work back from the end of the life of the derivative to the beginning. The explicit finite difference method is functionally the same as using a trinomial tree. The implicit finite difference method is more complicated but has the advantage that the user does not have to take any special precautions to ensure convergence.
In practice, the method that is chosen is likely to depend on the characteristics of the 
derivative being evaluated and the accuracy required. Monte Carlo simulation works forward from the beginning to the end of the life of a derivative. It can be used for European-style derivatives and can cope with a great deal of complexity as far as the payoffs are concerned. It becomes relatively more efficient as the number of underlying variables increases. Tree approaches and finite difference methods work from the end of  
the life of a security to the beginning and can accommodate American-style as well as  
European-style derivatives. However, they are difficult to apply when the payoffs depend on the past history of the state variables as well as on their current values.  
Also, they are liable to become computationally very time consuming when three or more variables are involved.

The volatility of the price of copper is 40% per annum and the risk-free rate is 6% per  
annum. Use a binomial tree to value an American call option on copper with an  
exercise price of $0.60 and a time to maturity of 1 year. Divide the life of the option  
into four 3-month periods for the purposes of constructing the tree. (Hint : As explained in Section 18. 6, the futures price of a variable is its expected future price in a risk-

 21.23. A company has issued a 3-year convertible bond that has a face value of $25 and can be 
exchanged for two of the company’s shares at any time. The company can call the issue, forcing conversion, when the share price is greater than or equal to $18. Assuming that  
the company will force conversion at the earliest opportunity, what are the boundary conditions for the price of the convertible? Describe how you would use finite difference methods to value the convertible assuming constant interest rates. Assume there is no

 21.26. A 1-year American call option on silver futures has an exercise price of $9.00. The  
current futures price is $8.50, the risk-free rate of interest is 12% per annum, and the  
volatility of the futures price is 25% per annum. Use the DerivaGem software with four 
3-month time steps to estimate the value of the option. Display the tree and verify that

∆t.

variance of the change in the logarithm of the stock price in time ∆t when terms of 
order 1∆t22 and higher are ignored.
(c) Construct an alternative to the trinomial model in Section 21. 4 so that the prob-
abilities are 1/6, 2/3, and 1/6 on the upper, middle, and lower branches emanating  
from each node. Assume that the branching is from S to Su, Sm, or Sd with m2=ud. 
Match the mean and variance of the change in the logarithm of the stock price  
exactly.
 21.28. The DerivaGem Application Builder functions enable you to investigate how the prices 
of options calculated from a binomial tree converge to the correct value as the number of  
time steps increases. (See Figure 21.4 and Sample Application A in DerivaGem.)  
Consider a put option on a stock index where the index level is 900, the strike price is  
900, the risk-free rate is 5%, the dividend yield is 2%, and the time to maturity is 2 years.

where the option is European and the volatility of the index is 20%.
(b) Produce results similar to Sample Application A on convergence for the situation where the option is American and the volatility of the index is 20%.
(c) Produce a chart showing the pricing of the American option when the volatility is  
20% as a function of the number of time steps when the control variate technique is  
used.

Value at Risk and 
Expected Shortfall
Chapter 19 examined measures such as delta, gamma, and vega for describing different 
aspects of the risk in a portfolio of derivatives. A financial institution usually calculates each of these measures each day for every market variable to which it is exposed. Often there are hundreds, or even thousands, of these market variables. A delta–gamma–vega  
analysis, therefore, leads to a very large number of different risk measures being  
produced each day. These risk measures provide valuable information for the financial institution’s traders. However, they do not provide a way of measuring the total risk to which the financial institution is exposed.
Value at risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES) are attempts to provide a single 
number summarizing the total risk in a portfolio of financial assets. They have become widely used by corporate treasurers and fund managers as well as by financial institu-tions. Bank regulators have traditionally used VaR in determining the capital a bank is required to keep for the risks it is bearing, but they are switching to ES for market risks.
This chapter explains the VaR and ES measures and describes the two main 
approaches for calculating them. These are known as the historical simulation approach 
and the model-building approach.22 CHAPTER  
22.1 THE V aR AND ES MEASURES
When using the value-at-risk measure, an analyst is interested in making a statement of  
the following form: “I am X percent certain there will not be a loss of more than V dollars  
in the next N days.” The variable V is the VaR of the portfolio. It is a function of two parameters: the time horizon (N days) and the confidence level (X%). It is the loss level over N days that has a probability of only 
1100-X2, of being exceeded.
Bank regulators have traditionally required banks to calculate VaR for market risk 
with N=10 and X=99 (see the discussion in Business Snapshot 22.1). If VaR with  
these parameters is $20 million for a bank, it is 99% certain that it will not lose more  
than $20 million over the next 10 days. The 99th percentile of the 10-day loss  
distribution is $20 million. Alternatively we can say that the first percentile of the gain distribution is 
-+20 million. VaR is illustrated in Figures 22.1 and 22.2.
M22_HULL0654_11_GE_C22.indd   514 30/04/2021   17:37Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall 515
VaR is an attractive measure because it is easy to understand. In essence, it asks  
the simple question “How bad can things get?” This is the question all senior  
managers want answered. They are very comfortable with the idea of compressing 
all the Greek letters for all the market variables underlying a portfolio into a single number.
If we accept that it is useful to have a single number to describe the risk of a  
portfolio, an interesting question is whether VaR is the best alternative. Some research-ers have argued that VaR may tempt traders to choose a portfolio with a return  
distribution similar to that in Figure 22.2. The portfolios in Figures 22.1 and 22.2 have the same VaR, but the portfolio in Figure 22.2 is much riskier because big losses are more likely.Business Snapshot 22.1 How Bank Regulators Use VaR
The Basel Committee on Bank Supervision is a committee of the world’s bank regulators that meets regularly in Basel, Switzerland. In 1988 it published what has become known as Basel I. This is an agreement between the regulators on how the capital a bank is required to hold for credit risk should be calculated. Later the Basel Committee published The 1996 Amendment which was implemented in 1998 and required banks to hold capital for market risk as well as credit risk. The Amendment distinguishes between a bank’s trading book and its banking book. The banking book consists primarily of loans and is not usually revalued on a regular basis for managerial and accounting purposes. The trading book consists of the myriad of different instruments that are traded by the bank (stocks, bonds, swaps, forward contracts, options, etc.) and is normally revalued daily.
The 1996 Amendment calculates capital for the trading book using the VaR  
measure with 
N=10 and X=99. This means that it focuses on the revaluation loss  
over a 10-day period that is expected to be exceeded only 1% of the time. The capital  
the bank is required to hold is k times this VaR measure (with an adjustment for what  
are termed specific risks). The multiplier k is chosen on a bank-by-bank basis by the  
regulators and must be at least 3.0. For a bank with excellent well-tested VaR estimation procedures, it is likely that k will be set equal to the minimum value  
of 3.0. For other banks it may be higher.
Basel I has been followed by Basel II, Basel II.5, Basel III, and Basel IV. Basel II  
(which was implemented in most parts of the world in about 2007) uses VaR with a one-year time horizon and a 99.9% confidence level for calculating capital for credit risk and operational risk. Basel II.5 (which was implemented in 2012) revised the way  
market risk capital is calculated. One of the changes involves what is known as stressed VaR. This is a VaR measure based on how market variables have moved during a particularly adverse time period. Basel III increased the amount of capital  
that banks are required to hold and the proportion of that capital that must be  
equity. Basel IV includes the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book, which involves  
basing the capital for market risk on expected shortfall with a 97.5% confidence level  
rather than VaR with a 99% confidence level. Basel IV also limits the extent to which  
banks can use internal models for calculating required capital.
M22_HULL0654_11_GE_C22.indd   515 30/04/2021   17:37516 CHAPTER 22
A measure that deals with the problem we have just mentioned is expected shortfall 
(ES).1 VaR asks the question: “How bad can things get?” ES asks: “If things do get 
bad, how much can the company expect to lose?” ES is the expected loss during an  
N-day period conditional on the loss being worse than the VaR loss. For example,  
with X=99 and N=10, the expected shortfall is the average amount the company  
loses over a 10-day period when the loss is worse than the 10-day 99% VaR. As  
mentioned in Business Snapshot 22.1, bank regulation is changing so that the capital 
for market risk is based on ES, not VaR. The confidence level is changing from 99% to 97.5%.
The Time Horizon
VaR and ES each have two parameters: the time horizon N, measured in days, and the confidence level X. In practice, analysts often set 
N=1 in the first instance when VaR 
or ES is estimated for market risk. This is because there is not usually enough data 
1  This measure is also known as C-VaR or expected tail loss. In P. Artzner, F. Delbaen, J.-M. Eber, and  
D. Heath, “Coherent Measures of Risk,” Mathematical Finance, 9 (1999): 203–28, the authors define certain 
properties that a good risk measure should have and show that the standard VaR measure does not have all of  
them whereas ES does. For more details, see J. C. Hull, Risk Management and Financial Institutions, 5th edn. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2018.Figure 22.1 Calculation of VaR from the probability distribution of the change in the 
portfolio value; confidence level is X%. Gains in portfolio value are positive; losses 
are negative.

available to estimate directly the behavior of market variables over periods of time 
longer than 1 day. The usual assumptions are
 N@day VaR=1@day VaR*2N
 N@day ES=1@day ES*2N
These formulas are exactly true when the changes in the value of the portfolio on  
successive days have independent identical normal distributions with mean zero. In other cases they are approximations.
2  There are alternatives here. A case can be made for using the fifth-highest loss, the sixth-highest loss, or an 
average of the two. In Excel’s PERCENTILE function, when there are n observations and k is an integer, the  
k>1n-12 percentile is the observation ranked k+1. Other percentiles are calculated using linear interpolation.22.2 HISTORICAL SIMULATION
Historical simulation is one popular way of estimating VaR or ES. It involves using past data as a guide to what will happen in the future. Suppose that we want to calculate VaR for a portfolio using a one-day time horizon, a 99% confidence level, and 501 days of data. The first step is to identify the market variables affecting the portfolio. These will typically be interest rates, equity prices, commodity prices, and so on. All prices are measured in the domestic currency. For example, one market variable for a German bank is likely to be the S&P 500 measured in euros.
Data are collected on movements in the market variables over the most recent 501 days.  
This provides 500 alternative scenarios for what can happen between today and tomor-row. Denote the first day for which we have data as Day 0, the second day as Day 1, and so on. Scenario 1 is where the percentage changes in the values of all variables are the same as they were between Day 0 and Day 1, Scenario 2 is where they are the same as between Day 1 and Day 2, and so on. For each scenario, the dollar change in the value of  
the portfolio between today and tomorrow is calculated. This defines a probability  
distribution for daily loss (gains are negative losses) in the value of the portfolio. The 99th percentile of the distribution can be estimated as the fifth-highest loss.
2 The estimate  
of VaR is this 99th percentile of the loss distribution. We are 99% certain that we will not take a loss greater than the VaR estimate if the changes in market variables in the last 501 days are representative of what will happen between today and tomorrow.
To express the approach algebraically, define 
vi as the value of a market variable on  
Day i and suppose that today is Day n. The ith scenario in the historical simulation 
approach assumes that the value of the market variable tomorrow will be
Value under ith scenario=vnvi

Illustration: Investment in Four Stock Indices
To illustrate the calculations underlying the approach, suppose that an investor in the  
United States owns, on July 8, 2020, a portfolio worth $10 million consisting of  
investments in four stock indices: the S&P 500 in the United States, the FTSE 100 in  
the United Kingdom, the CAC 40 in France, and the Nikkei 225 in Japan. The value of  
M22_HULL0654_11_GE_C22.indd   517 30/04/2021   17:38518 CHAPTER 22
the investment in each index on July 8, 2020, is shown in Table 22.1. An Excel  
spreadsheet containing 501 days of historical data on the closing prices of the four  
indices, together with exchange rates and a complete set of VaR and ES calculations are 
on the author’s website:3
www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull/OFOD/VaRExample
The data we use are total return indices where it is assumed that dividends paid on the  
stocks underlying the indices are reinvested in the indices. Because we are considering a  
U.S. investor, the value of the FTSE 100, CAC 40, and Nikkei 225 must be measured in  
U.S. dollars. For example, the FTSE 100 total return index was 6,515.12 on May 9, 2018  
(the beginning of the 501-day period considered), when the exchange rate was 1.3553 USD per GBP. This means that, measured in U.S. dollars, it was  
6,515.12*1.3553
=8,830.23. An extract from the data with all indices measured in U.S. dollars is in 
Table 22.2.
July 8, 2020, is an interesting date to choose in evaluating an equity investment. The  
COVID-19 pandemic had led to a big drop in equity markets in March 2020. By July 2020, U.S. markets had largely recovered, but there was still a great deal of uncertainty about how long the pandemic would continue and when the economy would recover.
Table 22.3 shows the values of the indices (measured in U.S. dollars) on July 9, 2020, 
for the scenarios considered. Scenario 1 (the first row in Table 22.3) shows the values of  
indices on July 9, 2020, assuming that their percentage changes between July 8 and Index Portfolio value ($000s)

July 9, 2020, are the same as they were between May 9 and May 10, 2018; Scenario 2  
(the second row in Table 22.3) shows the values of market variables on July 9, 2020, 
assuming these percentage changes are the same as those between May 10 and May 11,  
2018; and so on. In general, Scenario i assumes that the percentage changes in the  
indices between July 8 and July 9, 2020, are the same as they were between Day i-1 
and Day i for 1…i…500. The 500 rows in Table 22.3 are the 500 scenarios considered.
The S&P 500 total return index was 6,496.14 on July 8, 2020. On May 10, 2018, it  
was 5,343.70 up from 5,292.90 on May 9, 2018. Therefore, the value of the S&P 500  
total return index under Scenario 1 is
6,496.14*5,343.70
5,292.90=6,558.49
Similarly, the values of the FTSE 100, CAC 40, and Nikkei 225 total return indices are  
7,334.19, 15,545.12, and 340.79, respectively. It follows that the total value of the  
portfolio under Scenario 1 is (in $000s)
4,000*6,558.49
6,496.14+3,000*7,334.19
7,255.04+1,000*15,545.12
15,540.44+2,000*340.79
342.01
=10,064.257
The portfolio therefore has a gain of $64,257 under Scenario 1. A similar calculation is carried out for the other scenarios.
The losses for the 500 different scenarios are then ranked. An extract from the results 
of doing this is shown in Table 22.4. The worst scenario is number 427, where indices  
are assumed to change in the same way as between March 17 and March 18, 2020.  
Other big losses are also as a result of changes observed in March 2020. The one-day 99% value at risk can be estimated as the fifth worst loss. This is $422,291.
As explained in Section 22.1, the ten-day 99% VaR is usually calculated as 
210 times 
the one-day 99% VaR. In this case the ten-day VaR would therefore be
210*422,291=1,335,401
or $1,335,401.
Each day the VaR estimate in our example would be updated using the most recent 501 
days of data. Consider, for example, what happens on July 9, 2020 (Day 501). We find out  
new values for all the market variables and are able to calculate a new value for the Scenario

portfolio. We then go through the procedure we have outlined to calculate a new VaR. 
Data on the market variables from May 10, 2018, to July 9, 2020 (Day 1 to Day 501) are used in the calculation. (This gives us the required 500 observations on the percentage changes in market variables; the May 9, 2018, Day 0, values of the market variables are no longer used.) Similarly, on the next trading day, July 10, 2020 (Day 502), data from May 11, 2018, to July 10, 2020 (Day 2 to Day 502) are used to determine VaR, and so on.
In practice, a financial institution’s portfolio is, of course, considerably more  
complicated than the one we have considered here. It is likely to consist of thousands or tens of thousands of positions (involving exchange rates, commodity prices, interest  
rates, and so on). Some of the bank’s positions are typically in forward contracts, options, and other derivatives. Also, the portfolio itself is likely to change from day to day. If a bank’s trading leads to a riskier portfolio, VaR typically increases; if it leads to a less risky portfolio, VaR typically decreases. The VaR is calculated on any given day on the assumption that the portfolio will remain unchanged over the next business day.
In the case of interest rates, a bank typically needs several term structures of zero-  
coupon interest rates in a number of different currencies to value its portfolio. The market  
variables that are considered are the ones from which these term structures are calculated  
(see Chapter 4 for the calculation of the term structure of zero rates). There might be as many as ten market variables for each zero curve to which the bank is exposed.
Expected Shortfall
To calculate expected shortfall using historical simulation we average the observations in the tail of the distribution of losses. In the case of our example, the five worst losses ($000s) are from scenarios 427, 429, 424, 415, and 482 (see Table 22.4). The average of the losses for these scenarios is $669,391. This is the expected shortfall estimate.Scenario number Loss ($000s)

Weighting Observations
In the calculations presented so far, the 500 scenarios were given equal weight. In some 
situations, it might be considered appropriate to give more weight to recent scenarios. One way of doing this is to assign a weight to the ith scenario of
l
n-i11-l2
1-ln
where n is the number of scenarios and l is a parameter between zero and one. The 
weights sum to one and decline at rate l. We rank the scenarios as before and calculate 
cumulative weights. The 99% VaR is the loss for the first scenario which is such that the cumulative weight exceeds 0.01.
Suppose we use a value of 
l equal to 0.995. The weights assigned to scenarios 427, 
429, 424, and 415 are 0.003776, 0.003814, 0.003719, and 0.003555, respectively. The cumulative weights are 0.004833, 0.007590, 0.011309, and 0.014864. The VaR is the loss  
given by the third scenario, or $653,541. The expected shortfall is calculated by using weights proportional to 0.003776, 0.003814, and 
0.01-0.003776-0.003814 to the 
losses from the first three scenarios. It is about $833,200.
Stressed VaR and Stressed ES
The calculations given so far assume that the most recent data is used for the historical  
simulation on any given day. For example, when calculating VaR and ES for the four- index example, we used data from the immediately preceding 501 days. However,  
historical simulations can be based on data from any period in the past. Periods of  
high volatility will tend to give high values for VaR and ES, while periods of low  
volatility will tend to give low values.
Regulators have introduced measures known as stressed VaR and stressed ES. To 
calculate these measures, a financial institution must search for a 251-day period of extreme stress for their current portfolio. The data for that 251-day period then plays the same role as the 501-day period in our example. The changes in market variables between Day 0 and Day 1 of the 251-day period are used to create the first scenario; the  
changes in market variables between Day 1 and Day 2 of the 251-day period are used to  
create the second scenario; and so on. In total, 250 scenarios are created. The one-day 99% stressed VaR can be calculated as the loss that is midway between the loss for the  
second worst scenario and the loss for the third worst scenario. The one-day 99% stressed ES can be calculated as 
0.4c1+0.4c2+0.2c3, where c1, c2, and c3 are the three 
worst losses with c17c27c3.4
4  Sometimes only losses that are worse than the VaR level are averaged in determining stressed ES. With 250  
scenarios, stressed ES is then the average of the losses for the worst two scenarios.22.3 MODEL-BUILDING APPROACH
The main alternative to historical simulation is the model-building approach. Before  
getting into the details of the approach, it is appropriate to mention one issue  
concerned with the units for measuring volatility.
M22_HULL0654_11_GE_C22.indd   521 30/04/2021   17:38522 CHAPTER 22
Daily Volatilities
In option pricing, time is usually measured in years, and the volatility of an asset is 
usually quoted as a “volatility per year”. When using the model-building approach to calculate VaR or ES for market risk, time is usually measured in days and the volatility of an asset is usually quoted as a “volatility per day.”
What is the relationship between the volatility per year used in option pricing and the 
volatility per day used in VaR or ES calculations? Let us define 
syear as the volatility per  
year of a certain asset and sday as the equivalent volatility per day of the asset. Assuming  
252 trading days in a year, equation (15.2) gives the standard deviation of the con-tinuously compounded return on the asset in one year as either 
syear or sday2252. It 
follows that
syear=sday2252 or sday=syear>2252
so that daily volatility is about 6% of annual volatility.
As pointed out in Section 15.4, s day is approximately equal to the standard deviation of  
the percentage change in the asset price in one day. For the purposes of calculating VaR  
or ES we assume exact equality. The daily volatility of an asset price (or any other  
variable) is therefore defined as equal to the standard deviation of the percentage change  
in one day.
Our discussion in the next few sections assumes that estimates of daily volatilities and  
correlations are available. Chapter 23 discusses how the estimates can be produced.
Single-Asset Case
Consider how VaR is calculated using the model-building approach in a very simple situation where the portfolio consists of a position in a single stock: $10 million in shares of Microsoft. We suppose that 
N=10 and X=99, so that we are interested in the loss 
level over 10 days that we are 99% confident will not be exceeded. Initially, we consider a  
1-day time horizon.
Assume that the volatility of Microsoft is 2% per day (corresponding to about 32% 
per year). Because the size of the position is $10 million, the standard deviation of daily changes in the value of the position is 2% of $10 million, or $200,000.
It is customary in the model-building approach to assume that the expected change in  
a market variable over the time period considered is zero. This is not exactly true, but it  
is a reasonable assumption. The expected change in the price of a market variable over a short time period is generally small when compared with the standard deviation of the  
change. Suppose, for example, that Microsoft has an expected return of 20% per annum. Over a 1-day period, the expected return is 
0.20>252, or about 0.08%, whereas 
the standard deviation of the return is 2%. Over a 10-day period, the expected return is  
0.08*10, or about 0.8%, whereas the standard deviation of the return is 2210, or 
about 6.3%.
So far, we have established that the change in the value of the portfolio of Microsoft 
shares over a 1-day period has a standard deviation of $200,000 and (at least approxi-mately) a mean of zero. We assume that the change is normally distributed.
5 From the  
5  To be consistent with the option pricing assumption in Chapter 15, we could assume that the price of  
Microsoft is lognormal tomorrow. Because 1 day is such a short period of time, this is almost  
indistinguishable from the assumption we do make—that the change in the stock price between today and 
tomorrow is normal.
M22_HULL0654_11_GE_C22.indd   522 30/04/2021   17:38Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall 523
Excel NORMSINV function, N-110.012=-2.326. This means that there is a 1%  
probability that a normally distributed variable will decrease in value by more than 
2.326 standard deviations. Equivalently, it means that we are 99% certain that a  
normally distributed variable will not decrease in value by more than 2.326 standard deviations. The 1-day 99% VaR for our portfolio consisting of a $10 million position in  
Microsoft is therefore
2.326*200,000=+465,300
As discussed earlier, the N-day VaR is calculated as 2N times the 1-day VaR. The 
10-day 99% VaR for Microsoft is therefore
465,300*210=+1,471,300
Consider next a portfolio consisting of a $5 million position in AT&T, and suppose 
the daily volatility of AT&T is 1% (approximately 16% per year). A similar calculation to that for Microsoft shows that the standard deviation of the change in the value of the  
portfolio in 1 day is
5,000,000*0.01=50,000
Assuming the change is normally distributed, the 1-day 99% VaR is
50,000*2.326=+116,300
and the 10-day 99% VaR is
116,300*210=+367,800
Two-Asset Case
Now consider a portfolio consisting of both $10 million of Microsoft shares and  
$5 million of AT&T shares. We suppose that the returns on the two shares have a bivariate normal distribution with a correlation of 0.3. A standard result in statistics tells us that, if two variables X and Y have standard deviations equal to 
sX and sY with 
the coefficient of correlation between them equal to r, the standard deviation of X+Y 
is given by
sX+Y=2s2
X+s2Y+2rsXsY
To apply this result, we set X equal to the change in the value of the position in  
Microsoft over a 1-day period and Y equal to the change in the value of the position in AT&T over a 1-day period, so that
sX=200,000 and sY=50,000
The standard deviation of the change in the value of the portfolio consisting of both stocks over a 1-day period is therefore
2200,0002+50,0002+2*0.3*200,000*50,000=220,200
The mean change is assumed to be zero and the change is normally distributed. So the 1-day 99% VaR is therefore
220,200*2.326=+512,300
The 10-day 99% VaR is 210 times this, or $1,620,100.
M22_HULL0654_11_GE_C22.indd   523 30/04/2021   17:38524 CHAPTER 22
The examples we have just considered are simple illustrations of the use of the linear 
model for calculating VaR or ES. Suppose that we have a portfolio worth P consisting of n assets with an amount 
ai being invested in asset i 11…i…n2. Define ∆xi as the 
return on asset i in one day. The dollar change in the value of the investment in asset i 
in one day is ai ∆xi and
 ∆P=an
i=1ai ∆xi (22.2)
where ∆P is the dollar change in the value of the whole portfolio in one day.The Benefits of Diversification
In the example we have just considered:
1. The 10-day 99% VaR for the portfolio of Microsoft shares is $1,471,300.
2. The 10-day 99% VaR for the portfolio of AT&T shares is $367,800.
3. The 10-day 99% VaR for the portfolio of both Microsoft and AT&T shares is $1,620,100.
The amount
11,471,300+367,8002-1,620,100=+219,000
represents the benefits of diversification. If Microsoft and AT&T were perfectly  
correlated, the VaR for the portfolio of both Microsoft and AT&T would equal the VaR for the Microsoft portfolio plus the VaR for the AT&T portfolio. Less than  
perfect correlation leads to some of the risk being “diversified away.”

ES Calculation
When the loss is normally distributed with mean m, and standard deviation s, it can be 
shown that ES with a confidence level of X is given by
 ES=m+s e-Y2>2
22p11-X2 (22.1)
where Y is the Xth percentile point of the standard normal distribution (i.e., it is the 
point on a normal distribution with mean zero and standard deviation one that has a 
probability 1-X of being exceeded). This shows that, when m is assumed to be zero, 
ES like VaR is proportional to s.
The formula shows that in our example the ten-day ES for the Microsoft portfolio 
with 99% confidence 1X=0.99 and Y=2.3262 is $1,687,000; the ten-day ES for the 
AT&T portfolio with 99% confidence is $421,400; and the ten-day ES for the combined portfolio with 99% confidence is $1,856,100.
22.4 THE LINEAR MODEL
6  Harry Markowitz was one of the first researchers to study the benefits of diversification to a portfolio 
manager. He was awarded a Nobel prize for this research in 1990. See H. Markowitz, “Portfolio Selection,” 
Journal of Finance, 7, 1 (March 1952): 77–91.
M22_HULL0654_11_GE_C22.indd   524 30/04/2021   17:38Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall 525
In the example considered in the previous section, $10 million was invested in the first  
asset (Microsoft) and $5 million was invested in the second asset (AT&T), so that (in 
millions of dollars) a1=10, a2=5, and
∆P=10 ∆x1+5 ∆x2
If we assume that the ∆xi in equation (22.2) are multivariate normal, then ∆P is  
normally distributed. To calculate VaR or ES, we therefore need to calculate only  
the mean and standard deviation of ∆P. We assume, as discussed in the previous  
section, that the expected value of each ∆xi is zero. This implies that the mean of  
∆P is zero.
To calculate the standard deviation of ∆P, we define si as the daily volatility of the  
ith asset and rij as the coefficient of correlation between returns on asset i  and asset j .  
This means that si is the standard deviation of ∆xi, and rij is the coefficient of  
correlation between ∆xi and ∆xj. The variance of ∆P, which we will denote by s2
P, 
is given by
 s2
P=an
i=1an
j=1rijaiajsisj (22.3)
This equation can also be written as
s2P=an
i=1a2is2
i+2an
 i=1a
 j6irijaiajsisj
The standard deviation of the change over N days is sP2N, and the 99% VaR for an 
N-day time horizon is 2.326sP2N.
The portfolio return in one day is ∆P>P. From equation (22.3), the variance of this is
an
i=1an
j=1rij wi wj si sj
where wi=ai>P is the weight of the ith investment in the portfolio. This version of 
equation (22.3) is the one usually used by portfolio managers.
In the example considered in the previous section, s1=0.02, s2=0.01, and 
r12=0.3. As already noted, a1=10 and a2=5, so that from equation (22.3)
s2P=102*0.022+52*0.012+2*10*5*0.3*0.02*0.01=0.0485
and sP=0.2202. This is the standard deviation of the change in the portfolio value per  
day (in millions of dollars). The ten-day 99% VaR is 2.326*0.2202*210= 
+1.62 million. This agrees with the calculation in the previous section.
Correlation and Covariance Matrices
A correlation matrix is a matrix where the entry in the ith row and jth column is the  
correlation rij between variable i and j. It is shown in Table 22.5. Since a variable is  
always perfectly correlated with itself, the diagonal elements of the correlation matrix  
are 1. Furthermore, because rij=rji, the correlation matrix is symmetric. The 
M22_HULL0654_11_GE_C22.indd   525 30/04/2021   17:38526 CHAPTER 22
correlation matrix, together with the daily standard deviations of the variables,  
enables the portfolio variance to be calculated using equation (22.3).
Instead of working with correlations and volatilities, analysts often use variances and  
covariances. The daily variance vari of variable i is the square of its daily volatility:
vari=s2
i
The covariance covij between variable i and variable j is the product of the daily  
volatility of variable i, the daily volatility of variable j, and the correlation between i 
and j:
covij=si sj rij
The equation for the variance of the portfolio in equation (22.3) can be written
 s2
P=an
i=1an
j=1covijaiaj (22.4)
In a covariance matrix, the entry in the ith row and jth column is the covariance 
between variable i and variable j. As just mentioned, the covariance between a  
variable and itself is its variance. The diagonal entries in the matrix are therefore  
variances (see Table 22.6). For this reason, the covariance matrix is sometimes called 
the variance–covariance matrix. (Like the correlation matrix, it is symmetric.) Using 
matrix notation, the equation for the variance of the portfolio just given becomes

where a is the (column) vector whose ith element is ai, C is the variance–covariance

The Four-Index Example
We now return to the four-index example in Section 22.2. This involved the portfolio in 
Table 22.1. Data and calculations presented here can be found on the author’s website.
The correlations that would be calculated on July 8, 2020, from the previous 500 
returns are shown in Table 22.7 and the covariance matrix is shown in Table 22.8. From  
equation (22.4), the covariance matrix gives the variance of portfolio gains/losses ($000s)  
as 14,406.193. The standard deviation of portfolio gains/losses is the square root of this, or 120.03. The 1-day 99% VaR in $000s is therefore 
2.326*120.03=279.222 and the 
1-day 99% ES in $000s is, from equation (22.1), 319.894. These values are much lower than the values given by the historical simulation approach. This is because the latter are  
greatly affected by a handful of large losses occurring in March 2020.
In the next chapter we will see how the weights given to observations can decline as 
the observations become older when the volatilities and correlations are calculated in the model-building approach.
Handling Interest Rates
It is out of the question in the model-building approach to define a separate market variable for every single bond price or interest rate to which a company is exposed. Some simplifications are necessary when the model-building approach is used. One possibility is to assume that only parallel shifts in the yield curve occur. It is then  
necessary to define only one market variable: the size of the parallel shift. The

M22_HULL0654_11_GE_C22.indd   527 30/04/2021   17:38528 CHAPTER 22
changes in the value of a bond portfolio can then be calculated using the duration 
relationship
∆P=-DP ∆y
where P is the value of the portfolio, ∆P is the change in P in one day, D is the  
modified duration of the portfolio, and ∆y is the parallel shift in 1 day.
This approach does not usually give enough accuracy. The procedure usually  
followed is to choose as market variables the prices of zero-coupon bonds with standard maturities: 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, 7 years, 10 years, and 30 years. For the purposes of calculating VaR or ES, the cash flows from instruments in  
the portfolio are mapped into cash flows occurring on the standard maturity dates. Consider a $1 million position in a Treasury bond lasting 1.2 years that pays a coupon  
of 6% semiannually. Coupons are paid in 0.2, 0.7, and 1.2 years, and the principal is  
paid in 1.2 years. This bond is, therefore, in the first instance regarded as a $30,000 position in 0.2-year zero-coupon bond plus a $30,000 position in a 0.7-year zero- coupon bond plus a $1.03 million position in a 1.2-year zero-coupon bond. The  
position in the 0.2-year bond is then replaced by an approximately equivalent position  
in 1-month and 3-month zero-coupon bonds; the position in the 0.7-year bond is replaced by an approximately equivalent position in 6-month and 1-year zero-coupon bonds; and the position in the 1.2-year bond is replaced by an approximately equivalent position in 1-year and 2-year zero-coupon bonds. The result is that the position in the 1.2-year coupon-bearing bond is regarded as a position in zero-coupon bonds having maturities of 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years.
This procedure is known as cash-flow mapping. One way of doing it is explained in  
Technical Note 25 at www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull/TechnicalNotes. Note that cash-flow mapping is not necessary when the historical simulation approach is used. This is because the complete term structure of interest rates can be calculated from the variables that are considered for each of the scenarios generated by using the bootstrap method in Chapter 4.
Applications of the Linear Model
The simplest application of the linear model is to a portfolio with no derivatives  
consisting of positions in stocks and bonds. Cash-flow mapping converts the bonds to zero-coupon bonds with standard maturities. The change in the value of the portfolio is  
linearly dependent on the returns on the stocks and these zero-coupon bonds.
Another instrument that can be handled by the linear model is a forward contract to  
buy or sell foreign currency at a future time T. The contract can be regarded as the exchange of a foreign zero-coupon bond maturing at time T for a domestic zero-coupon  
bond maturing at time T. For the purposes of calculating VaR or ES, the forward contract is therefore treated as a long position in the foreign bond combined with a short position in the domestic bond. Each bond is handled using a cash-flow mapping procedure.
An overnight indexed swap (OIS) can also be handled using the linear model. It can  
be regarded as the exchange of a fixed-rate bond for a floating-rate bond. The floating- rate bond has a known value, which is the amount the notional principal would become if it were invested at overnight rates for a period of time starting at the last reset date. The fixed-rate bond can be handled using cash-flow mapping procedures.

The Linear Model and Options
We now consider how we might try to use the linear model when there are options. 
Consider first a portfolio consisting of options on a single stock whose current price  
is S. Suppose that the delta of the position (calculated in the way described in Chapter  
19) is d.7 Since d is the rate of change of the value of the portfolio with S, it is  
approximately true that
d=∆P
∆S
or
 ∆P=d ∆S (22.5)
where ∆S is the dollar change in the stock price in 1 day and ∆P is, as usual, the dollar 
change in the portfolio in 1 day. Define ∆x as the percentage change in the stock price 
in 1 day, so that
∆x=∆S
S
It follows that an approximate relationship between ∆P and ∆x is
∆P=Sd ∆x
When we have a position in several underlying market variables that includes options, 
we can derive an approximate linear relationship between ∆P and the ∆xi similarly. 
This relationship is
 ∆P=an
i=1Sidi∆xi (22.6)
where Si is the value of the ith market variable and di is the delta of the portfolio with 
respect to the ith market variable. This corresponds to equation (22.2):
∆P=an
i=1ai ∆xi
with ai=Sidi. Equation (22.3) or (22.4) can therefore be used to calculate the standard 
deviation of ∆P.
Example 22.1
A portfolio consists of options on Microsoft and AT&T. The options on Microsoft  
have a delta of 1,000, and the options on AT&T have a delta of 20,000. The  
Microsoft share price is $120, and the AT&T share price is $30. From equa-
tion (22.6), it is approximately true that
∆P=120*1,000*∆x1+30*20,000*∆x2
or
∆P=120,000 ∆x1+600,000 ∆x2
where ∆x1 and ∆x2 are the returns from Microsoft and AT&T in 1 day and ∆P is  
the resultant change in the value of the portfolio. (The portfolio is assumed to be

lower case Greek letters d and g to avoid overworking ∆.

equivalent to an investment of $120,000 in Microsoft and $600,000 in AT&T.) 
Assuming that the daily volatility of Microsoft is 2% and the daily volatility of AT&T is 1% and the correlation between the daily changes is 0.3, the standard deviation of 
∆P (in thousands of dollars) is
21120*0.0222+1600*0.0122+2*120*0.02*600*0.01*0.3=7.099
22.5 THE QUADRATIC MODEL
When a portfolio includes options, the linear model is an approximation. It does not  
take account of the gamma of the portfolio. As discussed in Chapter 19, delta is defined as the rate of change of the portfolio value with respect to an underlying market  
variable and gamma is defined as the rate of change of the delta with respect to the  
market variable. Gamma measures the curvature of the relationship between the  
portfolio value and an underlying market variable.
Figure 22.3 shows the impact of a nonzero gamma on the probability distribution of 
the value of the portfolio. When gamma is positive, the probability distribution tends to  
be positively skewed; when gamma is negative, it tends to be negatively skewed.  
Figures 22.4 and 22.5 illustrate the reason for this result. Figure 22.4 shows the relation-
ship between the value of a long call option and the price of the underlying asset. A long  
call is an example of an option position with positive gamma. The figure shows that, when the probability distribution for the price of the underlying asset at the end of 1 day  
is normal, the probability distribution for the option price is positively skewed.
8  
Figure 22.5 shows the relationship between the value of a short call position and the 
price of the underlying asset. A short call position has a negative gamma. In this case, we  
see that a normal distribution for the price of the underlying asset at the end of 1 day gets  
mapped into a negatively skewed distribution for the value of the option position.
The VaR or ES for a portfolio is critically dependent on the left tail of the probability 
distribution of the portfolio value. For example, when the confidence level used is 99%, the VaR is the value in the left tail below which there is only 1% of the distribution. As  
indicated in Figures 22.3a and 22.4, a positive gamma portfolio tends to have a less

distribution in VaR calculations.Figure 22.3 Probability distribution for value of portfolio: (a) positive gamma;

heavy left tail than the normal distribution. If the distribution of ∆P is normal, the 
calculated VaR tends to be too high. Similarly, as indicated in Figures 22.3b and 22.5, a 
negative gamma portfolio tends to have a heavier left tail than the normal distribution. 
If the distribution of ∆P is normal, the calculated VaR tends to be too low.
For a more accurate estimate of VaR than that given by the linear model, both delta  
and gamma measures can be used to relate ∆P to the ∆xi. Consider a portfolio  
dependent on a single asset whose price is S. Suppose d and g are the delta and gamma 
of the portfolio. From the appendix to Chapter 19, the equation
∆P=d ∆S+1
2g1∆S22
is an improvement over the approximation in equation (22.5).9 Setting
∆x=∆S
S
reduces this to
 ∆P=Sd ∆x+1
2S2g1∆x22 (22.7)
More generally for a portfolio with n underlying market variables, with each instrument 
in the portfolio being dependent on only one of the market variables, equation (22.7) becomes
∆P=an
i=1Sidi ∆xi+an
i=11
2S2
igi1∆xi22
where Si is the value of the ith market variable, and di and gi are the delta and gamma of  
the portfolio with respect to the ith market variable. When individual instruments in the  
portfolio may be dependent on more than one market variable, this equation takes the 
more general form
 ∆P=an
i=1Sidi∆xi+an
i=1an
j=11
2SiSjgij ∆xi ∆xj (22.8)
where gij is a “cross gamma” defined as
gij=02P
0Si0Sj
Equation (22.8) is not as easy to work with as equation (22.2) because ∆P is not normally  
distributed. If there are only a small number of variables, equation (22.8) can be used to 
calculate moments for ∆P. A result in statistics known as the Cornish–Fisher expansion 
can be used to estimate percentiles of the probability distribution from the moments.10
9 The Taylor series expansion in the appendix to Chapter 19 suggests the approximation ∆P=
Θ ∆t+d ∆S+1
2g1∆S22 when terms of higher order than ∆t are ignored. In practice, the Θ ∆t term is  
much smaller than the others when ∆S is large, as it usually is when the “worst case” movements in P are 
being considered.
10 See Technical Note 10 at www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull/TechnicalNotes for details of the calculation  
of moments and the use of Cornish–Fisher expansions. When there is a single underlying variable, E1∆P2=
0.5S2gs2, E1∆P22=S2d2s2+0.75S4g2s4,  and  E1∆P32=4.5S4d2gs4+1.875S6g3s6, where S is the  
value of the variable and s is its daily volatility. Sample Application E in the DerivaGem Applications 
implements the Cornish–Fisher expansion method for this case.

As an alternative to the procedure described so far, the model-building approach can be  
implemented using Monte Carlo simulation to generate the probability distribution 
for ∆P. Suppose we wish to calculate a 1-day VaR for a portfolio. The procedure is  
as follows:
1. Value the portfolio today in the usual way using the current values of market variables.
2. Sample once from the multivariate normal probability distribution of the 
∆xi.11
3. Use the values of the ∆xi that are sampled to determine the value of each market 
variable at the end of one day.
4. Revalue the portfolio at the end of the day in the usual way.
5. Subtract the value calculated in Step 1 from the value in Step 4 to determine a 
sample ∆P.
6. Repeat Steps 2 to 5 many times to build up a probability distribution for ∆P.
The VaR is calculated as the appropriate percentile of the probability distribution of 
∆P. Suppose, for example, that we calculate 5,000 different sample values of ∆P in the 
way just described. The 1-day 99% VaR is the value of ∆P for the 50th worst outcome; 
the 1-day VaR 95% is the value of ∆P for the 250th worst outcome; and so on.12 The 
N-day VaR is usually assumed to be the 1-day VaR multiplied by 2N.13
The drawback of Monte Carlo simulation is that it tends to be slow because a  
company’s complete portfolio (which might consist of hundreds of thousands of  
different instruments) has to be revalued many times.14 One way of speeding things up 
is to assume that equation (22.8) describes the relationship between ∆P and the ∆xi. We  
can then jump straight from Step 2 to Step 5 in the Monte Carlo simulation and avoid the  
need for a complete revaluation of the portfolio. This is sometimes referred to as the 
partial simulation approach. A similar approach is sometimes used when implementing historical simulation.22.6 MONTE CARLO SIMULATION
11 One way of doing so is given in Section 21.6.
12 A technique known as extreme value theory can be used to “smooth the tails” so that better estimates of 
extreme percentiles are obtained in both Monte Carlo and historical simulation.
13 This is only approximately true when the portfolio includes options, but it is the assumption that is made 
in practice for most VaR calculation methods.
14 An approach for limiting the number of portfolio revaluations is proposed in F. Jamshidian and Y. Zhu, 
“Scenario Simulation Model: Theory and Methodology,” Finance and Stochastics, 1 (1997), 43–67.22.7 COMPARISON OF APPROACHES
We have discussed two methods for estimating VaR: the historical simulation approach and the model-building approach. The basic model-building approach in Sections 22.3 and 22.4 assumes that changes in the portfolio’s value are linearly dependent on the underlying market variables. This means that it is not accurate when the portfolio  
contains nonlinear derivatives. Monte Carlo simulation can be used to avoid the  
linearity assumption, but the speed advantages of the model-building approach are 
M22_HULL0654_11_GE_C22.indd   533 30/04/2021   17:38534 CHAPTER 22
Once a model for calculating VaR has been developed, an important reality check is 
back testing. This involves testing how well the VaR estimates would have performed in  
the past. Suppose that we are calculating a 1-day 99% VaR. Back testing would involve looking at how often the loss in a day exceeded the 1-day 99% VaR that would have been calculated for that day. If this happened on about 1% of the days, we can feel reasonably comfortable with the methodology for calculating VaR. If it happened on, say, 7% of days, the methodology is suspect. Unfortunately ES is more difficult to back test than VaR.then lost. The model-building approach is most appropriate for portfolios consisting of  
long and short positions in assets without any nonlinear derivatives. Results can be 
produced speedily and it can be used in conjunction with volatility updating procedures  
such as those we will describe in the next chapter. It has the disadvantage that it assumes a multivariate normal distribution for the asset returns. (Often these returns have heavier tails than the normal distribution, as illustrated in Table 20.1.)
The historical simulation approach has the advantage that historical data determine  
the joint probability distribution of the market variables. It also avoids the need for cash-flow mapping. The main disadvantages of historical simulation are that it is  
computationally slow and does not easily allow volatility updating schemes to be  
used.

22.9 PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS ANALYSIS
One approach to handling the risk arising from groups of highly correlated market 
variables is principal components analysis. This is a standard statistical tool with many applications in risk management. It takes historical data on movements in the market  
variables and attempts to define a set of components or factors that explain the  
movements.
The approach is best illustrated with an example. The market variables we will  
consider are U.S. Treasury rates with maturities 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 5 years, 7 years,  
10 years, 20 years, and 30 years. Tables 22.9 and 22.10 show results produced for these 
market variables using 2,631 daily observations between 2010 and 2020. The first  
column in Table 22.9 shows the maturities of the rates that were considered. The remaining eight columns in the table show the eight factors (or principal components) describing the rate moves. The first factor, shown in the column labeled PC1, corres-  
ponds to a shift in the yield curve where all rates move in the same direction. When we have one unit of that factor, the 1-year rate increases by 0.083 basis points, the 2-year rate increases by 0.210 basis points, and so on. The second factor is shown in the column labeled PC2. It corresponds to a “twist” or change of slope of the yield curve. Rates with  
maturities between 1 year and 7 years move in one direction; rates with maturities 
M22_HULL0654_11_GE_C22.indd   534 30/04/2021   17:38Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall 535
between 10 years and 30 years move in the other direction. The third factor corresponds  
to a “bowing” of the yield curve. Relatively short rates and relatively long rates move in  
one direction; the intermediate rates move in the other direction. The interest rate move  
for a particular factor is known as factor loading. In our example, the first factor’s  
loading for the 1-year rate is 0.083.16 (Note that the signs for factor loadings are  
somewhat arbitrary. We can change the signs for all factor loadings corresponding to 
a particular factor without changing the model. For example, if we did so for the first factor, 
-1 unit of that factor would result in the same yield curve changes as + 1 unit 
does in Table 22.9.)
Because there are eight rates and eight factors, the interest rate changes observed on  
any given day can always be expressed as a linear sum of the factors by solving a set of  
eight simultaneous equations. The quantity of a particular factor in the interest rate changes on a particular day is known as the factor score for that day.
The importance of a factor is measured by the standard deviation of its factor score. 
The standard deviations of the factor scores in our example are shown in Table 22.10 and the factors are listed in order of their importance. The numbers in Table 22.10 are 
measured in basis points. A quantity of the first factor equal to 1 standard deviation, therefore, corresponds to the 1-year rate moving by 
0.083*11.54=0.96 basis points, 
the 2-year rate moving by 0.210*11.54=2.42 basis points, and so on.
Software for carrying out the calculations underlying Tables 22.9 and 22.10 is on the  
author’s website (www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/∙ hull/ofod). The factors have the prop-
erty that the factor scores are uncorrelated across the data. For instance, in our  
example, the first factor score (amount of parallel shift) is uncorrelated with the second factor score (amount of twist) across the 2,631 days. The variances of the factor scores have the property that they add up to the total variance of the data. From Table 22.10,

16 The factor loadings have the property that the sum of their squares for each factor is 1.0. Also, note that a 
factor is not changed if the signs of all its factor loadings are reversed.
M22_HULL0654_11_GE_C22.indd   535 30/04/2021   17:38536 CHAPTER 22
the total variance of the original data (that is, sum of the variance of the observations 
on the 1-year rate, the variance of the observations on the 2-year rate, and so on) is
11.542+3.552+1.782+g+0.572=152.5
From this it can be seen that the first factor accounts for 11.542>152.5=87.3, of the 
variance in the original data; the first two factors account for
111.542+3.5522>152.5=95.6,
of the variance in the data; the third factor accounts for a further 2.1% of the variance. This shows that most of the risk in interest rate moves is accounted for by the first two or three factors. It suggests that we can relate the risks in a portfolio of interest rate dependent instruments to movements in these factors instead of considering all eight interest rates.
The three most important factors from Table 22.9 are plotted in Figure 22.6.

Using Principal Components Analysis to Calculate VaR
To illustrate how a principal components analysis can be used to calculate VaR, consider  
a portfolio with the exposures to interest rate moves shown in Table 22.11. A 1-basis-point change in the 2-year rate causes the portfolio value to increase by $10 million, a  
1-basis-point change in the 3-year rate causes it to increase by $4 million, and so on. Suppose the first two factors are used to model rate moves. (As mentioned above, this Figure 22.6 The three most important factors driving movements in U.S.

17 Results similar to those described here, concerning the nature of the factors and the amount of the total 
risk they account for, are obtained when a principal components analysis is used to explain the movements in  
almost any yield curve in any country.
M22_HULL0654_11_GE_C22.indd   536 30/04/2021   17:38Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall 537
captures 95.6% of the variance in rate moves.) Using the data in Table 22.9, the exposure  
to the first factor (measured in millions of dollars per factor score basis point) is
10*0.210+4*0.286-8*0.386-7*0.430+2*0.428=-1.99
and the exposure to the second factor is
10*1-0.4652+4*1-0.4672-8*1-0.3152-7*1-0.0992+2*0.119=-3.06
Suppose that f1 and f2 are the factor scores (measured in basis points). The change in 
the portfolio value is, to a good approximation, given by
∆P=-1.99f1-3.06f2
The factor scores are uncorrelated and have the standard deviations given in Table 22.10.  
The standard deviation of ∆P is therefore
21.992*11.542+3.062*3.552=25.45
Assuming normally distributed factors, the 1-day 99% VaR is 25.45*2.326=59.2.
A principal components analysis can in theory be used for market variables other 
than interest rates. Suppose that a financial institution has exposures to a number of 
different stock indices. A principal components analysis can be used to identify factors describing movements in the indices and the most important of these can be used to replace the market indices in a VaR analysis. How effective a principal components analysis is for a group of market variables depends on how closely correlated they are.
As explained earlier in the chapter, VaR is usually calculated by relating the actual 
changes in a portfolio to percentage changes in market variables (the 
∆xi). For a VaR 
calculation, it may therefore be most appropriate to carry out a principal components analysis on percentage changes in market variables rather than actual changes.
SUMMARY
A value at risk (VaR) calculation is aimed at making a statement of the form: “We are  
X percent certain that we will not lose more than V dollars in the next N days. ” The variable V is the VaR, X% is the confidence level, and N days is the time horizon. 
Expected shortfall (ES) is the expected loss conditional on the loss being greater than the VaR level.
One approach to calculating VaR or ES is historical simulation. This involves  
creating a database consisting of the daily movements in all market variables over a 2-year

period of time. The first simulation trial assumes that the percentage changes in each 
market variable are the same as those on the first day covered by the database; the second simulation trial assumes that the percentage changes are the same as those on  
the second day; and so on. The change in the portfolio value, 
∆P, is calculated for each  
simulation trial, and the VaR is calculated as the appropriate percentile of the  
probability distribution of ∆P. ES is the average of the observations in the VaR tail.
An alternative is the model-building approach. This is relatively straightforward if 
two assumptions can be made:
1. The change in the value of the portfolio 1∆P2 is linearly dependent on percentage 
changes in market variables.
2. The percentage changes in market variables are multivariate normally distributed.
The probability distribution of ∆P is then normal, and there are analytic formulas for 
relating the standard deviation of ∆P to the volatilities and correlations of the under -
lying market variables. The VaR or ES can be calculated from well-known properties of  
the normal distribution.
When a portfolio includes options, ∆P is not linearly related to the percentage 
changes in market variables. From knowledge of the gamma of the portfolio, we can derive an approximate quadratic relationship between 
∆P and percentage changes in 
market variables. Monte Carlo simulation can then be used to estimate VaR.
In the next chapter we discuss how volatilities and correlations can be estimated and  
monitored.

Practice Questions
 22.1. Consider a position consisting of a $100,000 investment in asset A and a $100,000  
investment in asset B. Assume that the daily volatilities of both assets are 1% and that 
the coefficient of correlation between their returns is 0.3. Estimate the 5-day 99% VaR and ES for the portfolio assuming normally distributed returns.
 22.2. Describe three ways of handling instruments that are dependent on interest rates when the model-building approach is used to calculate VaR. How would you handle these instruments when historical simulation is used to calculate VaR?
 22.3. A financial institution owns a portfolio of options on the U.S. dollar–sterling exchange rate. The delta of the portfolio is 56.0. The current exchange rate is 1.5000. Derive an approximate linear relationship between the change in the portfolio value and the  
percentage change in the exchange rate. If the daily volatility of the exchange rate is 0.7%, estimate the 10-day 99% VaR.
 22.4. Suppose you know that the gamma of the portfolio in the previous question is 16.2. How does this change your estimate of the relationship between the change in the portfolio value and the percentage change in the exchange rate?
 22.5. Suppose that the daily change in the value of a portfolio is, to a good approximation, linearly dependent on two factors, calculated from a principal components analysis. The delta of a portfolio with respect to the first factor is 6 and the delta with respect to the second factor is

 22.10. Some time ago a company entered into a forward contract to buy £1 million for  
$1.5 million. The contract now has 6 months to maturity. The daily volatility of a  
6-month zero-coupon sterling bond (when its price is translated to dollars) is 0.06% and  
the daily volatility of a 6-month zero-coupon dollar bond is 0.05%. The correlation 
between returns from the two bonds is 0.8. The current exchange rate is 1.53. Calculate the standard deviation of the change in the dollar value of the forward contract in 1 day. What is the 10-day 99% VaR? Assume that the 6-month interest rate in both sterling and  
dollars is 5% per annum with continuous compounding.

 22.11. The text calculates a VaR estimate for the example in Table 22.11 assuming two factors. 
How does the estimate change if you assume (a) one factor and (b) three factors.
 22.12. A bank has a portfolio of options on an asset. The delta of the options is -30 and the 
gamma is -5. Explain how these numbers can be interpreted. The asset price is 20 and 
its volatility is 1% per day. Adapt Sample Application E in the DerivaGem Application 
Builder software to calculate VaR.
 22.13. Suppose that in Problem 22.12 the vega of the portfolio is -2 per 1% change in the 
annual volatility. Derive a model relating the change in the portfolio value in 1 day to 
delta, gamma, and vega. Explain without doing detailed calculations how you would use the model to calculate a VaR estimate.
 22.14. The 1-day 99% VaR is calculated using historical simulation for the four-index example 
in Section 22.2 as $422,291. Look at the underlying spreadsheets on the author’s website and calculate using historical simulation: (a) the 1-day 95% VaR, (b) the 1-day 95% ES, (c) the 1-day 97% VaR, and (d) the 1-day 97% ES. Repeat your calculations using the model-building approach.
 22.15. Use the spreadsheets on the author’s website to calculate the 1-day 99% VaR and ES, 
employing the basic methodology in Section 22.2, if the four-index portfolio considered in  
Section 22.2 is equally divided between the four indices. Repeat your calculations using 
the model-building approach.
 22.16. A company has a position in bonds worth $6 million. The modified duration of the  
portfolio is 5.2 years. Assume that only parallel shifts in the yield curve can take place 
and that the standard deviation of the daily yield change (when yield is measured in  
percent) is 0.09. Use the duration model to estimate the 20-day 90% VaR for the  
portfolio. Explain carefully the weaknesses of this approach to calculating VaR. Explain two alternatives that give more accuracy.
 22.17. Consider a portfolio of options on a single asset. Suppose that the delta of the portfolio

-2.6. Derive a quadratic relationship between the change in the portfolio 
value and the percentage change in the underlying asset price in one day. How would you use this in a Monte Carlo simulation?
 22.18. A company has a long position in a 2-year bond and a 3-year bond, as well as a short  
position in a 5-year bond. Each bond has a principal of $100 and pays a 5% coupon 
annually. Calculate the company’s exposure to the 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, 4-year, and 5-year rates. Use the data in Tables 22.9 and 22.10 to calculate a 20-day 95% VaR on the  
assumption that rate changes are explained by (a) one factor, (b) two factors,  
and (c) three factors. Assume that the zero-coupon yield curve is flat at 5%.
 22.19. A bank has written a call option on one stock and a put option on another stock. For  
the first option the stock price is 50, the strike price is 51, the volatility is 28% per  
annum, and the time to maturity is 9 months. For the second option the stock price is  
20, the strike price is 19, the volatility is 25% per annum, and the time to maturity is  
1 year. Neither stock pays a dividend, the risk-free rate is 6% per annum, and the  
correlation between stock price returns is 0.4. Calculate a 10-day 99% VaR: (a) using 
only deltas, (b) using the partial simulation approach, and (c) using the full simulation approach.

Estimating 
Volatilities and 
Correlations23 CHAPTER  
In this chapter we explain how historical data can be used to produce estimates of the 
current and future levels of volatilities and correlations. The chapter is relevant both to the calculation of value at risk using the model-building approach and to the valuation of derivatives. When calculating value at risk, we are most interested in the current levels of volatilities and correlations because we are assessing possible changes in the value of a portfolio over a very short period of time. When valuing derivatives, forecasts of volatilities and correlations over the whole life of the derivative are usually required.
The chapter considers models with imposing names such as exponentially weighted 
moving average (EWMA), autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH), and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH). The distinctive feature of the models is that they recognize that volatilities and correlations are not constant. During some periods, a particular volatility or correlation may be relatively low, whereas during other periods it may be relatively high. The models attempt to keep track of the variations in the volatility or correlation through time.
23.1 ESTIMATING VOLATILITY
Define sn as the volatility of a market variable on day n , as estimated at the end of 
day n-1. The square of the volatility, s2
n, on day n is the variance rate. We described 
the standard approach to estimating sn from historical data in Section 15.4. Suppose 
that the value of the market variable at the end of day i is Si. The variable ui is defined 
as the continuously compounded return during day i (between the end of day i-1 and 
the end of day i):
ui=ln Si
Si-1
An unbiased estimate of the variance rate per day, s2
n, using the most recent m 
 observations on the ui is
 s2
n=1
m-1am
i=11un-i-u22 (23.1)
M23_HULL0654_11_GE_C23.indd   542 30/04/2021   17:39Estimating Volatilities and Correlations 543
where u is the mean of the ui’s:
u=1
m am
i=1un-i
For the purposes of monitoring daily volatility, the formula in equation (23.1) is 
usually changed in a number of ways:
1. ui is defined as the percentage change in the market variable between the end of 
day i-1 and the end of day i, so that:1
 ui=Si-Si-1
Si-1 (23.2)
2. u is assumed to be zero.2
3. m-1 is replaced by m.3
These three changes make very little difference to the estimates that are calculated, but 
they allow us to simplify the formula for the variance rate to
 s2
n=1
mam
i=1u2n-i (23.3)
where u i is given by equation (23.2).4
Weighting Schemes
Equation (23.3) gives equal weight to u2n-1, u2n-2, c, u2n-m. Our objective is to estimate 
the current level of volatility, sn. It therefore makes sense to give more weight to recent 
data. A model that does this is
 s2
n=am
i=1aiu2n-i (23.4)
The variable ai is the amount of weight given to the observation i days ago. The a’s are  
positive. If we choose them so that ai6aj when i7j, less weight is given to older 
observations. The weights must sum to unity, so that
am
i=1ai=1
An extension of the idea in equation (23.4) is to assume that there is a long-run average 
1 This is consistent with the point made in Section 22.3 about the way that volatility is defined for the 
 purposes of VaR calculations.
2 As explained in Section 22.3, this assumption is reasonable because the expected change in a variable in one 
day is very small when compared with the standard deviation of changes.
3 Replacing m-1 by m moves us from an unbiased estimate of the variance to a maximum likelihood 
 estimate. Maximum likelihood estimates are discussed later in this chapter.
4 Note that the u’s in this chapter play the same role as the ∆x’s in Chapter 22. Both are daily percentage 
changes in market variables. In the case of the u ’s, the subscripts count observations made on different days 
on the same market variable. In the case of the ∆x’s, they count observations made on the same day on 
different market variables. The use of subscripts for s is similarly different between the two chapters. In this 
chapter, the subscripts refer to days; in Chapter 22 they referred to market variables.
M23_HULL0654_11_GE_C23.indd   543 30/04/2021   17:39544 CHAPTER 23
variance rate and that this should be given some weight. This leads to the model that 
takes the form
 s2
n=gVL+am
i=1aiu2n-i (23.5)
where VL is the long-run variance rate and g is the weight assigned to VL. Since the 
weights must sum to unity, we have
g+am
i=1ai=1
This is known as an ARCH(m ) model. It was first suggested by Engle.5 The estimate of 
the variance is based on a long-run average variance and m  observations. The older an 
observation, the less weight it is given. Defining v=gVL, the model in equation (23.5) 
can be written
 s2
n=v+am
i=1aiu2n-i (23.6)
In the next two sections we discuss two important approaches to monitoring volatility 
using the ideas in equations (23.4) and (23.5).
5 See R. Engle “ Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity with Estimates of the Variance of U.K. 
 Inflation, ” Econometrica, 50 (1982): 987–1008.23.2 THE EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE MODEL
The exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) model is a particular case of the model in equation (23.4) where the weights 
ai decrease exponentially as we move back 
through time. Specifically, ai+1=lai, where l is a constant between 0 and 1.
It turns out that this weighting scheme leads to a particularly simple formula for 
updating volatility estimates. The formula is
 s2
n=ls2
n-1+11-l2u2
n-1 (23.7)
The estimate, sn, of the volatility of a variable for day n  (made at the end of day n-1) is 
calculated from sn-1 (the estimate that was made at the end of day n-2 of the volatility 
for day n-1) and un-1 (the most recent daily percentage change in the variable).
To understand why equation (23.7) corresponds to weights that decrease exponen-
tially, we substitute for s2
n-1 to get
s2
n=l3ls2n-2+11-l2u2n-24+11-l2u2n-1
or
s2
n=11-l21u2
n-1+lu2
n-22+l2s2
n-2
Substituting in a similar way for s2
n-2 gives
s2
n=11-l21u2n-1+lu2n-2+l2u2n-32+l3s2n-3
M23_HULL0654_11_GE_C23.indd   544 30/04/2021   17:39Estimating Volatilities and Correlations 545
Continuing in this way gives
s2
n=11-l2am
i=1li-1u2n-i+lms2n-m
For large m, the term lms2n-m is sufficiently small to be ignored, so that equation (23.7) 
is the same as equation (23.4) with ai=11-l2li-1. The weights for the ui decline at 
rate l as we move back through time. Each weight is l times the previous weight.
Example 23.1
Suppose that l is 0.90, the volatility estimated for a market variable for day n-1 
is 1% per day, and during day n-1 the market variable increased by 2%. This 
means that s2n-1=0.012=0.0001 and u2n-1=0.022=0.0004. Equation (23.7) 
gives
s2n=0.9*0.0001+0.1*0.0004=0.00013
The estimate of the volatility, sn, for day n is therefore 20.00013, or 1.14%, per 
day. Note that the expected value of u2n-1 is s2n-1, or 0.0001. In this example, the  
realized value of u2n-1 is greater than the expected value, and as a result our 
 volatility estimate increases. If the realized value of u2
n-1 had been less than its 
expected value, our estimate of the volatility would have decreased.
The EWMA approach has the attractive feature that relatively little data need be 
stored. At any given time, only the current estimate of the variance rate and the most 
recent observation on the value of the market variable need be remembered. When a new observation on the market variable is obtained, a new daily percentage change is calculated and equation (23.7) is used to update the estimate of the variance rate. The old estimate of the variance rate and the old value of the market variable can then be discarded.
The EWMA approach is designed to track changes in the volatility. Suppose there  
is a big move in the market variable on day 
n-1, so that u2
n-1 is large. From 
 equation (23.7) this causes the estimate of the current volatility to move upward.  
The value of l governs how responsive the estimate of the daily volatility is to the 
most recent daily percentage change. A low value of l leads to a great deal of weight 
being given to the u2
n-1 when sn is calculated. In this case, the estimates produced for 
the volatility on successive days are themselves highly volatile. A high value of l (i.e., 
a value close to 1.0) produces estimates of the daily volatility that respond relatively 
slowly to new information provided by the daily percentage change.
The RiskMetrics database, which was originally created by JP Morgan and made 
publicly available in 1994, used the EWMA model with l=0.94 for updating daily 
volatility estimates. This is because the company found that, across a range of different market variables, this value of 
l gives forecasts of the variance rate that come closest  
to the realized variance rate.6 The realized variance rate on a particular day was 
 calculated as an equally weighted average of the u2
i on the subsequent 25 days (see 
Problem 23.19).
6 See JP Morgan, RiskMetrics Monitor, Fourth Quarter, 1995. We will explain an alternative (maximum 
likelihood) approach to estimating parameters later in the chapter.
M23_HULL0654_11_GE_C23.indd   545 30/04/2021   17:39546 CHAPTER 23
We now move on to discuss what is known as the GARCH(1,1) model, proposed by 
Bollerslev in 1986.7 The difference between the GARCH(1,1) model and the EWMA 
model is analogous to the difference between equation (23.4) and equation (23.5). In GARCH(1,1), 
s2
n is calculated from a long-run average variance rate, VL, as well as 
from sn-1 and un-1. The equation for GARCH(1,1) is
 s2
n=gVL+au2n-1+bs2n-1 (23.8)
where g is the weight assigned to VL, a is the weight assigned to u2
n-1, and b is the weight 
assigned to s2
n-1. Since the weights must sum to unity, it follows that
g+a+b=1
The EWMA model is a particular case of GARCH(1,1) where g=0, a=1-l, 
and b=l.
The “(1,1)” in GARCH(1,1) indicates that s2
n is based on the most recent observa-
tion of u2 and the most recent estimate of the variance rate. The more general 
GARCH(p , q) model calculates s2
n from the most recent p  observations on u2 and  
the most recent q estimates of the variance rate.8 GARCH(1,1) is by far the most 
 popular of the GARCH models.
Setting v=gVL, the GARCH(1,1) model can also be written
 s2
n=v+au2n-1+bs2n-1 (23.9)
This is the form of the model that is usually used for the purposes of estimating the 
parameters. Once v, a, and b have been estimated, we can calculate g as 1-a-b. The 
long-term variance VL can then be calculated as v>g. For a stable GARCH(1,1) process  
we require a+b61. Otherwise the weight applied to the long-term variance is 
 negative.
Example 23.2
Suppose that a GARCH(1,1) model is estimated from daily data as
s2
n =0.000002+0.13u2n-1+0.86s2n-1
This corresponds to a=0.13,   b=0.86, and v=0.000002. Because 
g=1-a-b, it follows that g=0.01. Because v=gVL, it follows that 
VL=0.0002. In other words, the long-run average variance per day implied by 
the model is 0.0002. This corresponds to a volatility of 20.0002=0.014, or 1.4%, 
per day.
7 See T. Bollerslev, “Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity, ” Journal of Econometrics, 
31 (1986): 307–27 .
8 Other GARCH models have been proposed that incorporate asymmetric news. These models are designed 
so that sn depends on the sign of un-1. Arguably, the models are more appropriate for equities than 
GARCH(1,1). As mentioned in Chapter 20, the volatility of an equity’s price tends to be inversely related to  
the price so that a negative un-1 should have a bigger effect on sn than the same positive un-1. For a 
 discussion of models for handling asymmetric news, see D. Nelson, “Conditional Heteroscedasticity and 
Asset Returns: A New Approach, ” Econometrica, 59 (1990): 347–70; R. F. Engle and V . Ng, “Measuring and 
Testing the Impact of News on Volatility, ” Journal of Finance, 48 (1993): 1749–78.23.3 THE GARCH(1,1) MODEL
M23_HULL0654_11_GE_C23.indd   546 30/04/2021   17:39Estimating Volatilities and Correlations 547
Suppose that the estimate of the volatility on day n-1 is 1.6% per day, so that 
s2
n-1=0.0162=0.000256, and that on day n-1 the market variable decreased 
by 1%, so that u2
n-1=0.012=0.0001. Then
s2
n=0.000002+0.13*0.0001+0.86*0.000256=0.00023516
The new estimate of the volatility is therefore 20.00023516=0.0153, or 1.53%, 
per day.
The Weights
Substituting for s2
n-1 in equation (23.9) gives
s2
n=v+au2n-1+b1v+au2n-2+bs2n-22
or
s2
n=v+bv+au2n-1+abu2n-2+b2s2n-2
Substituting for s2
n-2 gives
s2
n=v+bv+b2v+au2n-1+abu2n-2+ab2 u2n-3+b3s2n-3
Continuing in this way, we see that the weight applied to u2
n-i is abi-1. The weights 
decline exponentially at rate b. The parameter b can be interpreted as a “decay rate”. It 
is similar to l in the EWMA model. It defines the relative importance of the observa-
tions on the u’s in determining the current variance rate. For example, if b=0.9, then 
u2
n-2 is only 90% as important as u2
n-1; u2n-3 is 81% as important as u2
n-1; and so on. 
The GARCH(1,1) model is similar to the EWMA model except that, in addition to 
assigning weights that decline exponentially to past u2, it also assigns some weight to 
the long-run average volatility.
Mean Reversion
The GARCH (1,1) model recognizes that over time the variance tends to get pulled back to a long-run average level of 
VL. The amount of weight assigned to VL is g =  
1 - a - b. The GARCH(1,1) is equivalent to a model where the variance V follows the 
stochastic process
dV=a1VL-V2dt+jV dz
where time is measured in days, a=1-a-b, and j=a22 (see Problem 23.14). This  
is a mean-reverting model. The variance has a drift that pulls it back to VL at rate a. 
When V7VL, the variance has a negative drift; when V6VL, it has a positive drift. 
Superimposed on the drift is a volatility j. Chapter 27 discusses this type of model 
further.
23.4 CHOOSING BETWEEN THE MODELS
In practice, variance rates do tend to be mean reverting. The GARCH(1,1) model incorporates mean reversion, whereas the EWMA model does not. GARCH (1,1) is therefore theoretically more appealing than the EWMA model.
M23_HULL0654_11_GE_C23.indd   547 30/04/2021   17:39548 CHAPTER 23
In the next section, we will discuss how best-fit parameters v, a, and b in GARCH(1,1) 
can be estimated. When the parameter v is zero, the GARCH(1,1) reduces to EWMA. In  
circumstances where the best-fit value of v turns out to be negative, the GARCH(1,1) 
model is not stable and it makes sense to switch to the EWMA model.
23.5 MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD METHODS
It is now appropriate to discuss how the parameters in the models we have been 
 considering are estimated from historical data. The approach used is known as the 
 maximum likelihood method. It involves choosing values for the parameters that 
 maximize the chance (or likelihood) of the data occurring.
To illustrate the method, we start with a very simple example. Suppose that we 
 sample 10 stocks at random on a certain day and find that the price of one of them 
declined on that day and the prices of the other nine either remained the same or increased. What is the best estimate of the probability of a randomly chosen stock’s price declining on the day? The natural answer is 0.1. Let us see if this is what the  maximum likelihood method gives.
Suppose that the probability of a price decline is p . The probability that one 
 particular stock declines in price and the other nine do not is 
p11-p29. Using the 
maximum likelihood approach, the best estimate of p  is the one that maximizes  
p11-p29. Differentiating this expression with respect to p  and setting the result equal 
to zero, we find that p=0.1 maximizes the expression. This shows that the maximum 
likelihood estimate of p  is 0.1, as expected.
Estimating a Constant Variance
Our next example of maximum likelihood methods considers the problem of estimating 
the variance of a variable X from m observations on X when the underlying distribution is normal with zero mean. Assume that the observations are 
u1, u2, c, um. Denote the 
variance by v. The likelihood of ui being observed is defined as the probability density 
function for X when X=ui. This is

i
2vb
The likelihood of m observations occurring in the order in which they are observed is
 qm
i=1c1
22pvexpa-u2
i
2vbd (23.10)
Using the maximum likelihood method, the best estimate of v  is the value that 
 maximizes this expression.
Maximizing an expression is equivalent to maximizing the logarithm of the expres-
sion. Taking logarithms of the expression in equation (23.10) and ignoring constant 
multiplicative factors, it can be seen that we wish to maximize
 am
i=1c-ln1v2-u2
i
vd (23.11)

i=1u2

Differentiating this expression with respect to v and setting the resulting equation to 
zero, we see that the maximum likelihood estimator of v is9

Estimating EWMA or GARCH (1,1) Parameters
We now consider how the maximum likelihood method can be used to estimate the parameters when EWMA, GARCH (1,1), or some other volatility updating scheme is used. Define 
vi=s2
i as the variance estimated for day i. Assume that the probability 
distribution of ui conditional on the variance is normal. A similar analysis to the one 
just given shows the best parameters are the ones that maximize

Taking logarithms, we see that this is equivalent to maximizing

i=1c-ln1vi2-u2

vid (23.12)
This is the same as the expression in equation (23.11), except that v  is replaced by vi. It is 
necessary to search iteratively to find the parameters in the model that maximize the 
expression in equation (23.12).
The spreadsheet in Table 23.1 indicates how the calculations could be organized for 
the GARCH(1,1) model. The table analyzes data on the S&P 500 between July 10, 2015, and July 9, 2020.
10 The first column in the table records the date. The second column 
counts the days. The third column shows the S&P 500, Si, at the end of day i. The fourth 
column shows the proportional change in the S&P 500 between the end of day i-1 and 
the end of day i. This is ui=1Si-Si-12>Si-1.
We start by storing trial values for v, a, and b in cells of the spreadsheet. We use an 
iterative procedure to move from these values to optimal values. The fifth column shows the estimate of the variance rate, 
vi=s2
i, for day i  made at the end of day i-1. On day 3, 
we start things off by setting the variance equal to u2
2. On subsequent days, equation (23.9) 
is used with the current values of v, a, and b. The sixth column tabulates the likelihood  
measure, -ln1vi2-u2
i>vi. The iterative search procedure chooses v, a, and b to maximize 
the sum of the numbers in the sixth column.11
9 This confirms the point made in footnote 3.

In our example, the optimal values of the parameters turn out to be
v=0.0000039818, a=0.223793, b=0.747577
and the maximum value of the function in equation (23.12) is 10,837.4227. The 
 numbers shown in Table 23.1 were calculated on the final iteration of the search for 
the optimal v, a, and b.
The long-term variance rate, VL, in our example is
v
1-a-b=0.0000039818
0.02863=0.0001391
The long-term volatility is 20.0001391, or 1.179%, per day.
Figures 23.1 and 23.2 show the S&P 500 index and its GARCH(1,1) volatility during 
the 5-year period covered by the data. Most of the time, the volatility was less than 2% per day, but volatilities as high as 8% per day were experienced in March 2020.
An alternative approach to estimating parameters in GARCH(1,1), which is some-
times more robust, is known as variance targeting.
12 This involves setting the long-run 
average variance rate, VL, equal to the sample variance calculated from the data (or to  
some other value that is believed to be reasonable). The value of v then equals 
VL11-a-b2 and only two parameters ( a and b) have to be estimated. For the data 
in Table 23.1, the sample variance is 0.0001490, which gives a daily volatility of 1.2208%. Setting 
VL equal to the sample variance, the values of a and b that maximize the objective  
function in equation (23.12) are 0.22636 and 0.74704, respectively. The value of the objective function is 10,837.4047, only marginally below the value of 10,837.4227 obtained using the earlier procedure.
When the EWMA model is used, the estimation procedure is relatively simple. We set 
v=0, a=1-l, and b=l, and only one parameter has to be estimated. In the data in 
Table 23.1, the value of l that maximizes the objective function in equation (23.12) is 
0.9182 and the value of the objective function is 10,692.6213.Date Day i Si ui vi=s2

For both GARCH (1,1) and EWMA, we can use the Solver routine in Excel to search 
for the values of the parameters that maximize the likelihood function. The routine 
works well provided that the spreadsheet is structured so that the parameters being searched for have roughly equal values. For example, in GARCH (1,1) we could let cells  
A1, A2, and A3 contain 
v*105, 10a, and b. We could then set B1=A1>100,000, 
B2=A2>10, and B3=A3. We would use B1, B2, and B3 to calculate the likelihood 
function. We would ask Solver to calculate the values of A1, A2, and A3 that maximize the likelihood function. Occasionally Solver gives a local maximum, so testing a number of different starting values for parameters is a good idea.Figure 23.1 S&P 500 index: July 10, 2015, to July 9, 2020.

How Good Is the Model?
The assumption underlying a GARCH model is that volatility changes with the  passage 
of time. During some periods volatility is relatively high; during other periods it is   
relatively low. To put this another way, when u2
i is high, there is a tendency for u2
i+1, 
u2
i+2, cto be high; when u2
i is low, there is a tendency for u2
i+1, u2i+2, cto be low. We 
can test how true this is by examining the autocorrelation structure of the u2
i.
Let us assume the u2
i do exhibit autocorrelation. If a GARCH model is working well, it 
should remove the autocorrelation. We can test whether it has done so by considering the  
autocorrelation structure for the variables u2
i >s2
i. If these show very little autocorrelation, 
our model for si has succeeded in explaining autocorrelations in the u2
i.
Table 23.2 shows results for the S&P 500 data used above. The first column shows the 
lags considered when the autocorrelation is calculated. The second shows autocorrela-
tions for u2
i; the third shows autocorrelations for u2
i>s2
i.13 The table shows that the 
autocorrelations are positive for u2
i for all lags between 1 and 15. In the case of u2
i>s2i, 
some of the autocorrelations are positive and some are negative. They are all much smaller in magnitude than the autocorrelations for 
u2
i.
The GARCH model appears to have done a good job in explaining the data. For a 
more scientific test, we can use what is known as the Ljung–Box statistic.14 If a certain 
series has m observations the Ljung–Box statistic is

(1978): 297–303.

where hk is the autocorrelation for a lag of k, K is the number of lags considered, and
wk=m+2
m-k
For K=15, zero autocorrelation can be rejected with 95% confidence when the Ljung– 
Box statistic is greater than 25.
From Table 23.2, the Ljung–Box statistic for the u2
i series is about 2,170. This is 
strong evidence of autocorrelation. For the u2
i>s2i series, the Ljung–Box statistic is 13.2, 
suggesting that the autocorrelation has been largely removed by the GARCH model.
23.6 USING GARCH(1,1) TO FORECAST FUTURE VOLATILITY
The variance rate estimated at the end of day n-1 for day n, when GARCH(1,1) is 
used, is
s2
n=11-a-b2VL+au2n-1+bs2n-1
so that
s2
n-VL=a1u2
n-1-VL2+b1s2
n-1-VL2
On day n+t in the future,
s2
n+t-VL=a1u2n+t-1-VL2+b1s2n+t-1-VL2
The expected value of u2
n+t-1 is s2
n+t-1. Hence,
E3s2
n+t-VL4=1a+b2E3s2
n+t-1-VL4
where E denotes expected value. Using this equation repeatedly yields
E3s2
n+t-VL4=1a+b2t1s2n-VL2
or
 E3s2
n+t4=VL+1a+b2t1s2
n-VL2 (23.13)
This equation forecasts the volatility on day n+t using the information available at the  
end of day n-1. In the EWMA model, a+b=1 and equation (23.13) shows that the 
expected future variance rate equals the current variance rate. When a+b61, the final 
term in the equation becomes progressively smaller as t increases. Figure 23.3 shows the 
expected path followed by the variance rate for situations where the current variance  
rate is different from VL. As mentioned earlier, the variance rate exhibits mean reversion 
with a reversion level of VL and a reversion rate of 1-a-b. Our forecast of the future 
variance rate tends towards VL as we look further and further ahead. This analysis 
emphasizes the point that we must have a+b61 for a stable GARCH(1,1) process. 
When a+b71, the weight given to the long-term average variance is negative and the 
process is “mean fleeing” rather than “mean reverting”.
For the S&P 500 data considered earlier, a+b=0.9714 and VL=0.0001391. 
 Suppose that the estimate of the current variance rate per day is 0.0003. (This 
 corresponds to a volatility of 1.732% per day.) In 10 days, the expected variance rate is
0.0001391+0.97141010.0003-0.00013912=0.0002594
M23_HULL0654_11_GE_C23.indd   553 30/04/2021   17:39554 CHAPTER 23
The expected volatility per day is 1.61%, still well above the long-term volatility of 
1.18% per day. However, the expected variance rate in 100 days is
0.0001391+0.971410010.0003-0.00013912=0.0001479
and the expected volatility per day is 1.22%, much closer to the long-term volatility.
Volatility Term Structures
Suppose it is day n. Define:
V1t2=E1s2
n+t2
and
a=ln1
a+b
so that equation (23.13) becomes
V1t2=VL+e-at3V102-VL4
Here, V1t2 is an estimate of the instantaneous variance rate in t days. The average 
 variance rate per day between today and time T is given by
1
T3T
0V1t2 dt=VL+1-e-aT
aT3V102-VL4
The larger T is, the closer this is to VL. Define s1T2 as the volatility per annum that 
should be used to price a T-day option under GARCH(1,1). Assuming 252 days per Figure 23.3 Expected path for the variance rate when (a) current variance rate is 
above long-term variance rate and (b) current variance rate is below long-term 
variance rate.

year, s1T22 is 252 times the average variance rate per day, so that
 s1T22=252aVL+1-e-aT
aT3V102-VL4b (23.14)
As discussed in Chapter 20, the market prices of different options on the same asset are 
often used to calculate a volatility term structure. This is the relationship between the implied volatilities of the options and their maturities. Equation (23.14) can be used to estimate a volatility term structure based on the GARCH(1,1) model. The estimated volatility term structure is not usually the same as the implied volatility term structure. However, as we will show, it is often used to predict the way that the implied volatility term structure will respond to volatility changes.
When the current volatility is above the long-term volatility, the GARCH(1,1) 
model estimates a downward-sloping volatility term structure. When the current volatility is below the long-term volatility, it estimates an upward-sloping volatility term structure. In the case of the S&P 500 data, 
a=ln11>0.971372=0.02905 and 
VL=0.0001391. Suppose that the current variance rate per day, V(0), is estimated as 
0.0003 per day. It follows from equation (23.14) that
s1T22=252a0.0001391+1-e-0.02905T
0.02905T10.0003-0.00013912b
where T is measured in days. Table 23.3 shows the volatility per year for different values 
of T.

Equation (23.14) can be written
s1T22=252cVL+1-e-aT

When s102 changes by ∆s102, s1T2 changes by approximately

Table 23.4 shows the effect of a volatility change on options of varying maturities for 
the S&P 500 data considered above. We assume as before that V102=0.0003, so that 
s102=2252*20.0003=27.50,. The table considers a 100-basis-point change in the  
instantaneous volatility from 27.50% per year to 28.50% per year. This means that 
∆s102=0.01, or 1%.Option life (days) 10 30 50 100 500

15 An analogy here is that variance rates were the fundamental variables for the EWMA and GARCH 
 procedures in the first part of this chapter, even though volatilities are easier to understand.Many financial institutions use analyses such as this when determining the exposure 
of their books to volatility changes. Rather than consider an across-the-board increase 
of 1% in implied volatilities when calculating vega, they relate the size of the volatility increase that is considered to the maturity of the option. Based on Table 23.4, a 0.90% volatility increase would be considered for a 10-day option, a 0.74% increase for a 30-day option, a 0.61% increase for a 50-day option, and so on.Option life (days) 10 30 50 100 500

23.7 CORRELATIONS
The discussion so far has centered on the estimation and forecasting of volatility. As explained in Chapter 22, correlations also play a key role in the calculation of VaR. In  
this section, we show how correlation estimates can be updated in a similar way to volatility estimates.
The correlation between two variables X and Y can be defined as
cov1X, Y2
sXsY
where sX and sY are the standard deviations of X  and Y  and cov 1X, Y2 is the covariance 
between X and Y. The covariance between X and Y is defined as
E31X-mX21Y-mY24
where mX and mY are the means of X  and Y , and E  denotes the expected value. 
Although it is easier to develop intuition about the meaning of a correlation than it  
is for a covariance, it is covariances that are the fundamental variables of our analysis.15
Define xi and yi as the percentage changes in X and Y between the end of day i-1 
and the end of day i:
xi=Xi-Xi-1
Xi-1,   yi=Yi-Yi-1
Yi-1
where Xi and Yi are the values of X and Y at the end of day i. We also define the 
 following:
sx,n : Daily volatility of variable X, estimated for day n
sy,n : Daily volatility of variable Y, estimated for day n
covn : Estimate of covariance between daily changes in X  and Y , calculated on day n .
M23_HULL0654_11_GE_C23.indd   556 30/04/2021   17:39Estimating Volatilities and Correlations 557
The estimate of the correlation between X and Y on day n is
covn
sx,n sy,n
Using equal weighting and assuming that the means of xi and yi are zero, equation (23.3) 
shows that the variance rates of X  and Y  can be estimated from the most recent m 
 observations as
s2
x,n=1
mam
i=1x2n-i,   s2y,n=1
mam
i=1y2n-i
A similar estimate for the covariance between X and Y is
 covn=1
mam
i=1xn-iyn-i (23.16)
One alternative for updating covariances is an EWMA model similar to equation (23.7). 
The formula for updating the covariance estimate is then
covn=l covn-1+11-l2xn-1yn-1
A similar analysis to that presented for the EWMA volatility model shows that the weights given to observations on the 
xi yi decline as we move back through time. The 
lower the value of l, the greater the weight that is given to recent observations.
Example 23.3
Suppose that l=0.95 and that the estimate of the correlation between two 
 variables X and Y on day n-1 is 0.6. Suppose further that the estimate of the 
volatilities for the X and Y on day n-1 are 1% and 2%, respectively. From the 
relationship between correlation and covariance, the estimate of the covariance between the X and Y on day 
n-1 is
0.6*0.01*0.02=0.00012
Suppose that the percentage changes in X and Y on day n-1 are 0.5% and 2.5%, 
respectively. The variance and covariance for day n would be updated as follows:
s2
x,n=0.95*0.012+0.05*0.0052=0.00009625
s2
y,n=0.95*0.022+0.05*0.0252=0.00041125
covn=0.95*0.00012+0.05*0.005*0.025=0.00012025
The new volatility of X is 20.00009625=0.981, and the new volatility of Y is 
20.00041125=2.028,. The new coefficient of correlation between X and Y is
0.00012025
0.00981*0.02028=0.6044
GARCH models can also be used for updating covariance estimates and forecasting the  
future level of covariances. For example, the GARCH(1,1) model for updating a  covariance is
covn=v+axn-1yn-1+b covn-1
and the long-term average covariance is v>11-a-b2. Formulas similar to those in 
M23_HULL0654_11_GE_C23.indd   557 30/04/2021   17:39558 CHAPTER 23
equations (23.13) and (23.14) can be developed for forecasting future covariances and 
calculating the average covariance during the life of an option.16
Consistency Condition for Covariances
Once all the variances and covariances have been calculated, a variance–covariance matrix can be constructed. As explained in Section 22.4, when 
i/notequal.alt1j, the 1i, j2th element 
of this matrix shows the covariance between variable i and variable j. When i=j, it 
shows the variance of variable i.
Not all symmetric variance–covariance matrices are internally consistent. The con-
dition for an N*N variance–covariance matrix Ω to be internally consistent is
 wTΩwÚ0 (23.17)
for all N*1 vectors w, where wT is the transpose of w. A matrix that satisfies this 
property is known as positive-semidefinite.
To understand why the condition in equation (23.17) must hold, suppose that wT is 
3w1, w2, c, wn4. The expression wT Ωw is the variance of w1x1+w2x2+g+wnxn, 
where xi is the value of variable i. As such, it cannot be negative.
To ensure that a positive-semidefinite matrix is produced, variances and covariances 
should be calculated consistently. For example, if variances are calculated by giving equal weight to the last m  data items, the same should be done for covariances. If variances are 
updated using an EWMA model with 
l=0.94, the same should be done for covariances.
An example of a variance–covariance matrix that is not internally consistent is
£1 0 0.9
0 1 0.9
0.9 0.9 1§
The variance of each variable is 1.0, and so the covariances are also coefficients of  correlation. The first variable is highly correlated with the third variable and the second 
variable is highly correlated with the third variable. However, there is no correlation at all between the first and second variables. This seems strange. When w is set equal to  
11, 1, -12, the condition in equation (23.17) is not satisfied, proving that the matrix is 
not positive-semidefinite.17
SUMMARY
Most popular option pricing models, such as Black–Scholes–Merton, assume that the volatility of the underlying asset is constant. This assumption is far from perfect. In practice, the volatility of an asset, like the asset’s price, is a stochastic variable. Unlike 
16 The ideas in this chapter can be extended to multivariate GARCH models, where an entire variance– 
 covariance matrix is updated in a consistent way. For a discussion of alternative approaches, see R. Engle and 
J. Mezrich, “GARCH for Groups, ” Risk, August 1996: 36–40.
17 It can be shown that the condition for a 3*3 matrix of correlations to be internally consistent is
r2
12+r213+r223-2r12 r13 r23…1
where rij is the coefficient of correlation between variables i and  j.

the asset price, it is not directly observable. This chapter has discussed procedures for 
attempting to keep track of the current level of volatility.
We define ui as the percentage change in a market variable between the end of 
day i-1 and the end of day i. The variance rate of the market variable (that is, the 
square of its volatility) is calculated as a weighted average of the ui2. The key feature of  
the procedures that have been discussed here is that they do not give equal weight to  
the observations on the ui2. The more recent an observation, the greater the weight 
assigned to it. In the EWMA and the GARCH(1,1) models, the weights assigned to  
 observations decrease exponentially as the observations become older. The  
GARCH(1,1) model differs from the EWMA model in that some weight is also 
assigned to the long-run average variance rate. It has a structure that enables forecasts of the future level of variance rate to be produced relatively easily.
Maximum likelihood methods are usually used to estimate parameters from historical 
data in the EWMA, GARCH(1,1), and similar models. These methods involve using an  
iterative procedure to determine the parameter values that maximize the chance or  
likelihood that the historical data will occur. Once its parameters have been determined, a GARCH(1,1) model can be judged by how well it removes autocorrelation from the 
ui2.
For every model that is developed to track variances, there is a corresponding model 
that can be developed to track covariances. The procedures described here can therefore  
be used to update the complete variance–covariance matrix used in value at risk  calculations.

is 0.94. Suppose that the price of the asset at the close of trading today is $30.50. How 
will this cause the volatility to be updated by the EWMA model?
 23.4. A company uses an EWMA model for forecasting volatility. It decides to change the parameter 
l from 0.95 to 0.85. Explain the likely impact on the forecasts.
 23.5. The volatility of a certain market variable is 30% per annum. Calculate a 99%  confidence interval for the size of the percentage daily change in the variable.
 23.6. A company uses the GARCH(1,1) model for updating volatility. The three parameters 
are 
v, a, and b. Describe the impact of making a small increase in each of the parameters 
while keeping the others fixed.
 23.7. The most recent estimate of the daily volatility of the U.S. dollar/sterling exchange rate is  
0.6% and the exchange rate at 4 p.m. yesterday was 1.5000. The parameter l in the 
EWMA model is 0.9. Suppose that the exchange rate at 4 p.m. today proves to be 1.4950. How would the estimate of the daily volatility be updated?
 23.8. Assume that S&P 500 at close of trading yesterday was 3,040 and the daily volatility of the index was estimated as 1% per day at that time. The parameters in a GARCH(1,1) model are 
v=0.000002, a=0.06, and b=0.92. If the level of the index at close of 
trading today is 3,060, what is the new volatility estimate?
 23.9. Suppose that the daily volatilities of asset A and asset B, calculated at the close of trading yesterday, are 1.6% and 2.5%, respectively. The prices of the assets at close of trading yesterday were $20 and $40 and the estimate of the coefficient of correlation between the returns on the two assets was 0.25. The parameter 
l used in the EWMA model is 0.95.
(a) Calculate the current estimate of the covariance between the assets.
(b) On the assumption that the prices of the assets at close of trading today are $20.5 and $40.5, update the correlation estimate.
 23.10. The parameters of a GARCH(1,1) model are estimated as 
v=0.000004, a=0.05, and 
b=0.92. What is the long-run average volatility and what is the equation describing the 
way that the variance rate reverts to its long-run average? If the current volatility is 20% 
per year, what is the expected volatility in 20 days?
 23.11. Suppose that the current daily volatilities of asset X and asset Y are 1.0% and 1.2%, 
respectively. The prices of the assets at close of trading yesterday were $30 and $50 and the estimate of the coefficient of correlation between the returns on the two assets made at this time was 0.50. Correlations and volatilities are updated using a GARCH(1,1) model. The estimates of the model’s parameters are 
a=0.04 and b=0.94. For the correlation 
v=0.000001, and for the volatilities v=0.000003. If the prices of the two assets at close 
of trading today are $31 and $51, how is the correlation estimate updated?
 23.12. Suppose that the daily volatility of the FTSE 100 stock index (measured in pounds 
 sterling) is 1.8% and the daily volatility of the dollar/sterling exchange rate is 0.9%. 
 Suppose further that the correlation between the FTSE 100 and the dollar/sterling 
exchange rate is 0.4. What is the volatility of the FTSE 100 when it is translated to U.S. dollars? Assume that the dollar/sterling exchange rate is expressed as the number of  
U.S. dollars per pound sterling. (Hint: When 
Z=XY, the percentage daily change in Z 
is approximately equal to the percentage daily change in X plus the percentage daily change in Y.)
 23.13. Suppose that in Problem 23.12 the correlation between the S&P 500 Index (measured in 
dollars) and the FTSE 100 Index (measured in sterling) is 0.7, the correlation between

the S&P 500 Index (measured in dollars) and the dollar/sterling exchange rate is 0.3, and 
the daily volatility of the S&P 500 index is 1.6%. What is the correlation between the S&P 500 index (measured in dollars) and the FTSE 100 index when it is translated to  
dollars? (Hint: For three variables X, Y, and Z, the covariance between 
X+Y and Z 
equals the covariance between X and Z plus the covariance between Y and Z.)
 23.14. Show that the GARCH (1,1) model s2
n=v+au2n-1+bs2n-1 in equation (23.9) is 
equivalent to the stochastic volatility model dV=a1VL-V2dt+jV dz, where time is 
measured in days, V is the square of the volatility of the asset price, and
a=1-a-b,   VL=v
1-a-b,   j=a22
  What is the stochastic volatility model when time is measured in years? (Hint: The 
 variable un-1 is the return on the asset price in time ∆t. It can be assumed to be normally 
distributed with mean zero and standard deviation sn-1. It follows from the moments of  
the normal distribution that the mean and variance of u2
n-1 are s2
n-1 and 2s4
n-1, 
 respectively.)
 23.15. Use the model-building approach in conjunction with the EWMA model to calculate 
VaR and ES for the four-index example in Chapter 22 when l=0.94.
 23.16. What is the effect of changing l from 0.94 to 0.97 in Problem 23.15.
 23.17. Suppose that the price of gold at close of trading yesterday was $600 and its volatility 
was estimated as 1.3% per day. The price at the close of trading today is $596. Update the volatility estimate using
(a) The EWMA model with 
l=0.94
(b) The GARCH(1,1) model with v=0.000002, a=0.04, and b=0.94.
 23.18. Suppose that in Problem 23.17 the price of silver at the close of trading yesterday was $16, 
its volatility was estimated as 1.5% per day, and its correlation with gold was estimated as  
0.8. The price of silver at the close of trading today is unchanged at $16. Update the volatility of silver and the correlation between silver and gold using the two models in Problem 23.17. In practice, is the 
v parameter likely to be the same for gold and silver?

Credit Risk
Most of the derivatives considered so far in this book have been concerned with market 
risk. In this chapter we consider another important risk for financial institutions: credit risk. Most financial institutions devote considerable resources to the measurement and management of credit risk. Regulators have for many years required banks to keep capital to reflect the credit risks they are bearing.
Credit risk arises from the possibility that borrowers and counterparties in derivatives 
transactions may default. This chapter discusses a number of different approaches to estimating the probability that a company will default and explains the key difference between risk-neutral and real-world probabilities of default. It examines the nature of the credit risk in over-the-counter derivatives transactions and discusses the clauses derivatives dealers write into their derivatives agreements to reduce credit risk. It also  
covers default correlation, Gaussian copula models, and the estimation of credit  
value at risk.
Chapter 25 will discuss credit derivatives and show how ideas introduced in this 
chapter can be used to value these instruments.24 CHAPTER  
24.1 CREDIT RATINGS
Rating agencies, such as Moody’s, S&P, and Fitch, are in the business of providing  ratings describing the creditworthiness of corporate bonds. The best rating assigned by  
Moody’s is Aaa. Bonds with this rating are considered to have almost no chance of 
defaulting. The next best rating is Aa. Following that comes A, Baa, Ba, B, Caa, Ca,  
and C. Only bonds with ratings of Baa or above are considered to be investment grade. The S&P and Fitch ratings corresponding to Moody’s Aaa, Aa, A, Baa, Ba, B, Caa,  
Ca, and C are AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, B, CCC, CC, and C, respectively. To create finer rating measures, Moody’s divides its Aa rating category into Aa1, Aa2, and Aa3, its A  
category into A1, A2, and A3, and so on. Similarly, S&P and Fitch divide their AA  rating category into AA+, AA, and AA-, their A rating category into A+, A, and A-,  
and so on. Moody’s Aaa category and the S&P/Fitch AAA category are not sub-  
divided, nor usually are the two lowest rating categories.
M24_HULL0654_11_GE_C24.indd   562 30/04/2021   17:40Credit Risk 563
Table 24.1 is typical of the data produced by rating agencies. It shows the default 
 experience during a 15-year period of bonds that had a particular rating at the beginning 
of the period. For example, a bond with a credit rating of BBB has a 0.16% chance of defaulting by the end of the first year, a 0.45% chance of defaulting by the end of the second year, and so on. The probability of a bond defaulting during a particular year can be calculated from the table. For example, the probability that a bond initially rated BBB will default during the second year is 
0.45,-0.16,=0.29,.
Hazard Rates
From Table 24.1 we can calculate the probability of a bond rated CCC/C defaulting during the third year as 
41.41,-36.64,=4.77,. We will refer to this as the 
unconditional default probability. It is the probability of default during the third year as seen today. The probability that the bond will survive until the end of year 2 is 
100,-36.64,=63.36,. The probability that it will default during the third year 
conditional on no earlier default is therefore 0.0477>0.6336, or 7.53%.
The 7.53% we have just calculated is a conditional probability for a 1-year time 
period. Suppose instead that we consider a short time period of length ∆t. The hazard 
rate l1t2 at time t is defined so that l1t2 ∆t is the probability of default between time t 
and t+∆t conditional on no earlier default.
If V1t2 is the cumulative probability of the company surviving to time t (i.e., no 
default by time t), the conditional probability of default between time t and t+∆t  
is 3V1t2-V1t+∆t24>V1t2. Since this equals l1t2 ∆t, it follows that
V1t+∆t2-V1t2=-l1t2V1t2 ∆t

M24_HULL0654_11_GE_C24.indd   563 30/04/2021   17:40564 CHAPTER 24
When a company goes bankrupt, those that are owed money by the company file claims 
against the assets of the company.1 Sometimes there is a reorganization in which these 
creditors agree to a partial payment of their claims. In other cases, the assets are sold by the liquidator and the proceeds are used to meet the claims as far as possible. Some claims typically have priority over other claims and are met more fully.
The recovery rate for a bond is normally defined as the bond’s market value shortly 
after default, as a percent of its face value. The recovery rate depends on the seniority of the bond (i.e., the extent to which it receives repayment before other creditors) and the security (i.e., the collateral, if any, that has been provided). An average recovery rate that is often assumed is 40%.
The Dependence of Recovery Rates on Default Rates
In Chapter 8, we saw that one of the lessons from the financial crisis of 2007–8 is that the  
average recovery rate on mortgages is negatively related to the mortgage default rate. As the mortgage default rate increases, foreclosures lead to more houses being offered for sale and a decline in house prices. This in turn results in a decline in recovery rates.
The average recovery rate on corporate bonds exhibits a similar negative  dependence 
on default rates.
2 In a year when the number of bonds defaulting is low, economic  
conditions are usually good and the average recovery rate on those bonds that do default might be as high as 60%; in a year when the default rate on corporate bonds is high, economic conditions are usually poor and the average recovery rate on the defaulting bonds might be as low as 30%. The result of the negative dependence is that a bad year  
for defaults is doubly bad for a lender because it is usually accompanied by a low recovery rate.Defining 
Q1t2 as the probability of default by time t, so that Q1t2=1-V1t2, gives
Q1t2=1-e-30t
l(t)dt
or
 Q1t2=1-e-l1t2t (24.1)
where l1t2 is the average hazard rate between time 0 and time t. Another term used for 
the hazard rate is default intensity.
24.3 RECOVERY RATES
1 In the United States, the claim made by a bond holder is the bond’s face value plus accrued interest.
2 See E. I. Altman, B. Brady, A. Resti, and A. Sironi, “The Link between Default and Recovery Rates: 
Theory, Empirical Evidence, and Implications,” Journal of Business, 78, 6 (2005): 2203–28.24.4 ESTIMATING DEFAULT PROBABILITIES FROM BOND  
YIELD SPREADS
Tables such as Table 24.1 provide one way of estimating default probabilities. Another 
approach is to look at bond yield spreads. A bond’s yield spread is the excess of the 
M24_HULL0654_11_GE_C24.indd   564 30/04/2021   17:40Credit Risk 565
promised yield on the bond over the risk-free rate. The usual assumption is that the 
excess yield is compensation for the possibility of default.3
Suppose that the bond yield spread for a T-year bond is s1T2 per annum. This means 
that the average loss rate on the bond between time 0 and time T should be approxi-mately 
s1T2 per annum. Suppose that the average hazard rate during this time is l1T2. 
Another expression for the average loss rate is l1T211-R2, where R is the estimated 
recovery rate. This means that it is approximately true that
l1T211-R2=s1T2
or
 l1T2=s1T2
1-R (24.2)
The approximation works very well in a wide range of situations.
Example 24.1
Suppose that 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year bonds issued by a corporation yield 150, 
180, and 195 basis points more than the risk-free rate, respectively. If the recovery  
rate is estimated at 40%, the average hazard rate for year 1 given by equa-tion ( 24.2) is 
0.0150>11-0.42=0.025 or 2.5% per annum. Similarly, the average 
hazard rate for years 1 and 2 is 0.0180>11-0.42=0.030 or 3.0% per annum, and  
the average hazard rate for all three years is 0.0195>11-0.42=0.0325 or 3.25%.  
These results imply that the average hazard rate for the second year is 
2*0.03-1*0.025=0.035 or 3.5% and that the average hazard rate for the 
third year is 3*0.0325-2*0.03=0.0375 or 3.75%.
Matching Bond Prices
For a more precise calculation we can choose hazard rates so that they match bond prices. The approach is similar to the bootstrap method for calculating a zero-coupon yield curve described in Section 4.7. Suppose that bonds with maturities 
ti are used, 
where t16t26t3g. The shortest maturity bond is used to calculate the hazard rate 
out to time t1. The next shortest maturity bond is used to calculate the hazard rate 
between times t1 and t2, and so on.
Example 24.2
Suppose that the risk-free rate is 5% per annum (continuously compounded) for all maturities and 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year bonds have yields of 6.5%, 6.8%, and  
6.95%, respectively (also continuously compounded). (This is consistent with the data in Example 24.1.) We suppose that each bond has a face value of $100 and provides semiannual coupons at the rate of 8% per year (with a coupon having just been paid). The values of the bonds can be calculated from their yields as $101.33,  
$101.99, and $102.47. If the bonds were risk-free the bond values (obtained by  discounting cash flows at 5%) would be $102.83, $105.52, and $108.08, respect-
ively. This means that the present value of expected default losses on the 1-year bond must be 
+102.83-+101.33=+1.50. Similarly, the present value of expected 
default losses on the 2-year and 3-year bonds must be $3.53 and $5.61. Suppose that the hazard rate in year i is 
li 11…i…32 and the recovery rate is 40%.
3 This assumption is not perfect, as we discuss later. For example, the price of a corporate bond is affected by 
its liquidity. The lower the liquidity, the lower its price.
M24_HULL0654_11_GE_C24.indd   565 30/04/2021   17:40566 CHAPTER 24
Consider the 1-year bond. The probability of a default in the first 6 months is  
1-e-0.5l1 and the probability of a default during the following 6 months is  
e-0.5l1-e-l1. We assume that defaults can happen only at the midpoints of  
these 6-month intervals. The possible default times are therefore in 3 months  
and 9 months. The (forward) risk-free value of the bond at the 3-month point is
4e-0.05*0.25+104e-0.05*0.75=+104.12
Given the definition of recovery rate in the previous section, if there is a default  
the bond will be worth $40. The present value of the loss if there is a default at the 
3-month point is therefore
1104.12-402e-0.05*0.25=+63.33
The risk-free value of the bond at the 9-month point is 104e-0.05*0.25=+102.71.  
If there is a default, the bond will be worth $40. The present value of a loss if there  
is a default at the 9-month point is therefore
1102.71-402e-0.05*0.75=+60.40
The hazard rate l1 must therefore satisfy
11-e-0.5l12*63.33+1e-0.5l1-e-l12*60.40=1.50
The solution to this (e.g., by using Solver in Excel) is l1=2.46,.
The 2-year bond is considered next. Its default probabilities at times 3 months  
and 9 months are known from the analysis of the 1-year bond. The hazard rate  
for the second year is calculated so that the present value of the expected loss on  
the bond is $3.53. The 3-year bond is treated similarly. The hazard rate for the  
second and third years prove to be 3.48% and 3.74%. (Note that the three  
estimated hazard rates are very similar to those calculated in Example 24.1 using  equation (24.2).) A worksheet showing the calculations is on the author’s website: www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull/ofod.
The Risk-Free Rate
The methods we have just presented for calculating default probabilities are critically dependent on the choice of a risk-free rate. The spreads in Example 24.1 are differences between bond yields and risk-free rates. The calculation of the expected losses from default implied by bond prices in Example 24.2 depends on calculating the prices of  
risk-free bonds. The benchmark risk-free rate used by bond traders is usually a  Treasury rate. For example, a bond trader might quote the yield on a bond as being  
a spread of 250 basis points over Treasuries. However, as discussed in Section 4.3, 
Treasury rates are too low to be useful proxies for risk-free rates.
Credit default swap (CDS) spreads, which were briefly explained in Section 7.11 and 
will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 25, provide a credit spread estimate that does not depend on the risk-free rate. A number of researchers have attempted to imply risk- free rates by comparing bond yields to CDS spreads. The implied risk-free rate in  normal market conditions seems to be close to the OIS rate.

The default probabilities estimated from historical data are usually much less than those 
derived from bond yield spreads. The difference between the two was particularly large during the financial crisis which started in mid-2007. This is because there was what is termed a “flight to quality” during the crisis, where all investors wanted to hold safe securities such as Treasury bonds. The prices of corporate bonds declined, thereby increasing their yields. The credit spread on these bonds increased and calculations such as the one in equation (24.2) gave very high hazard rate estimates.
Table 24.2 is taken from research published in 2005 which used Moody’s data.
5 It 
compares historical hazard rates with those implied by bond yields for bonds with  different ratings and shows that the latter are much greater than the former. The  
 historical hazard rate was calculated using data similar to that in Table 24.1. The 
 hazard rate implied by bond yields was calculated using equation (24.2) with a recovery 
rate of 40%. The bond yield spreads used were averages over a number of years. The risk-free rate was estimated from the credit default swap market to be 43 basis points higher than Treasuries. It can be seen that the ratio of the hazard rate calculated from  
bonds to the historical hazard rate tends to decline as a bond becomes less credit- worthy, whereas the difference between the two tends to increase. (The B-rated bonds do not quite conform to this pattern.)
More recent data gives a similar result to that in Table 24.2. Consider, for example, 
Baa-rated (or BBB-rated) bonds. The cumulative probability of default during a seven- year period, taken from Table 24.1, is 2.33%. Equation (24.10) gives
l172=-1
7 ln 31-Q1724
where l1t2 is the average hazard rate during t  years and Q1t2 is the cumulative probability 
of default by time t  years. Setting Q172=0.0233, we obtain l172=0.0034 (i.e., 0.34%, 
or 34 basis points). The spread of the Baa (or BBB) corporate bond yield over the risk-  
free rate was about 1.8% for the years preceding 2019. Equation (24.2) gives an  estimate

for the hazard rate implied by bond yields as 0.018>11-0.42=0.03, or 3% (about nine 
times the estimate from Table 24.1).
Table 24.3 shows another way of looking at the results in Table 24.2. The second 
 column shows the bond yield spread. The spread required to compensate for the 
 historical default rate is shown in the third column. (For example, in the case of the 
Baa bond it is 0.47,*0.6=0.28,, or 28 basis points.) The expected excess return is  
shown in the final column of the table.6
A large percentage difference between the two hazard rate estimates in Table 24.2 
translates into a small expected excess return on the bond. For Aaa-rated bonds, the ratio of the two hazard rates is 16.8, but the expected excess return is only 38 basis points. The expected excess return tends to increase as credit quality declines.
Real-World vs. Risk-Neutral Probabilities
The default probabilities or hazard rates implied from credit spreads are risk-neutral estimates. They can be used to calculate expected cash flows in a risk-neutral world when there is credit risk. The value of the cash flows is obtained using risk-neutral  valuation by discounting the expected cash flows at a risk-free rate. Example 24.2 shows  
an application of this to the calculation of the cost of defaults. We will see more 
 applications in the next chapter.
Default probabilities or hazard rates calculated from historical data are real-world 
(sometimes termed physical) default probabilities. Table 24.2 shows that risk-neutral 
default probabilities are much higher than real-world default probabilities. The expected excess return in Table 24.3 arises directly from the difference between real-world and risk-neutral default probabilities. If there were no expected excess return, then the real-world and risk-neutral default probabilities would be the same, and vice versa.
Why do we see such big differences between real-world and risk-neutral default 
probabilities? As we have just argued, this is the same as asking why corporate bond traders earn more than the risk-free rate on average.

compensate for this. This is true, but research shows that it does not fully explain the 
results in Table 24.3.7 Another possible reason for the results is that the subjective 
default probabilities of bond traders may be much higher than the those given in  
Table 24.1. Bond traders may be allowing for depression scenarios much worse than 
anything seen during the period covered by historical data. However, it is difficult to see how this can explain a large part of the excess return that is observed.
By far the most important reason for the results in Tables 24.2 and 24.3 is that 
bonds do not default independently of each other. There are periods of time when default rates are very low and periods of time when they are very high. Evidence for this can be obtained by looking at the default rates in different years. S&P statistics show that since 1981 the default rate per year in the U.S. for non-investment-grade rated companies has ranged from a low of 0.63% in 1981 to a high of 11.81% in 2009, respectively. The year-to-year variation in default rates gives rise to systematic risk (i.e.,  
risk that cannot be diversified away) and bond traders earn an excess expected return for bearing the risk. (This is similar to the excess expected return earned by equity  holders that is calculated by the capital asset pricing model—see the appendix to  
Chapter 3.) The variation in default rates from year to year may be because of overall 
economic conditions and it may be because a default by one company has a ripple effect resulting in defaults by other companies. (The latter is referred to by researchers as credit contagion.)
In addition to the systematic risk we have just talked about, there is nonsystematic (or 
idiosyncratic) risk associated with each bond. If we were talking about stocks, we would argue that investors can to a large extent diversify away the nonsystematic risk by choosing a portfolio of, say, 30 stocks. They should not therefore demand a risk premium for bearing nonsystematic risk. For bonds, the arguments are not so clear-cut. Bond  
returns are highly skewed with limited upside. (For example, on an individual bond, there  
might be a 99.75% chance of a 4% return in a year, and a 0.25% chance of a - 60%  
return in the year, the first outcome corresponding to no default and the second to default.) This type of risk is difficult to “diversify away”.
8 It would require tens of 
 thousands of different bonds. In practice, many bond portfolios are far from fully 
 diversified. As a result, bond traders may earn an extra return for bearing nonsystematic 
risk as well as for bearing the systematic risk mentioned in the previous paragraph.
Which Default Probability Estimate Should Be Used?
At this stage it is natural to ask whether we should use real-world or risk-neutral default probabilities in the analysis of credit risk. The answer depends on the purpose of the analysis. When valuing credit derivatives or estimating the impact of default risk on the pricing of instruments, risk-neutral default probabilities should be used. This is because the analysis calculates the present value of expected future cash flows and almost  
invariably (implicitly or explicitly) involves using risk-neutral valuation. When carrying out scenario analyses to calculate potential future losses from defaults, real-world default probabilities should be used.
7 For example, J. Dick-Nielsen, P. Feldhütter, and D. Lando, “Corporate Bond Liquidity before and after the  
Onset of the Subprime Crisis,” Journal of Financial Economics, 103, 3 (2012), 471–92, uses a number of different 
liquidity measures and a large database of bond trades. It shows that the liquidity component of credit spreads is relatively small.
8 See J. D. Amato and E. M. Remolona, “The Credit Spread Puzzle,” BIS Quarterly Review, 5 (Dec. 2003): 51–63.
M24_HULL0654_11_GE_C24.indd   569 30/04/2021   17:40570 CHAPTER 24
When we use a table such as Table 24.1 to estimate a company’s real-world probability 
of default, we are relying on the company’s credit rating. Unfortunately, credit ratings are revised relatively infrequently. This has led some analysts to argue that equity prices can provide more up-to-date information for estimating default probabilities.
In 1974, Merton proposed a model where a company’s equity is an option on the 
assets of the company.
9 Suppose, for simplicity, that a firm has one zero-coupon bond 
outstanding and that the bond matures at time T. Define:
V0: Value of company’s assets today
VT: Value of company’s assets at time T
E0: Value of company’s equity today
ET: Value of company’s equity at time T
D : Debt repayment due at time T
sV: Volatility of assets (assumed constant)
sE: Instantaneous volatility of equity.
If VT6D, it is (at least in theory) rational for the company to default on the debt at 
time T. The value of the equity is then zero. If VT7D, the company should make the 
debt repayment at time T and the value of the equity at this time is VT-D. Merton’s 
model, therefore, gives the value of the firm’s equity at time T as
ET=max1VT-D, 02
This shows that the equity is a call option on the value of the assets with a strike price equal to the repayment required on the debt. The Black–Scholes–Merton formula gives the value of the equity today as
 
E0=V0N1d12-De-rT N1d22 (24.3)
where
d1=ln1V0>D2+1r+s2
V>22T
sV2T and d2=d1-sV2T
The value of the debt today is V0-E0.
The risk-neutral probability that the company will default on the debt is N1-d22. To 
calculate this, we require V0 and sV. Neither of these are directly observable. However, 
if the company is publicly traded, we can observe E0. This means that equation (24.3) 
provides one condition that must be satisfied by V0 and sV. We can also estimate sE 
from historical data or options. From ItÔ’s lemma,
 sE E0=0E
0V sV V0=N1d12sV V0 (24.4)
This provides another equation that must be satisfied by V0 and sV. Equations (24.3) 
and (24.4) provide a pair of simultaneous equations that can be solved for V0 and sV.1024.6 USING EQUITY PRICES TO ESTIMATE DEFAULT PROBABILITIES
9 See R. Merton “On the Pricing of Corporate Debt: The Risk Structure of Interest Rates,” Journal of 
Finance, 29 (1974): 449–70.
10 To solve two nonlinear equations of the form F1x, y2=0 and G1x, y2=0, the Solver routine in Excel can 
be asked to find the values of x and y that minimize 3F1x, y242+3G1x, y242.
M24_HULL0654_11_GE_C24.indd   570 30/04/2021   17:40Credit Risk 571
Example 24.3
The value of a company’s equity is $3 million and the volatility of the equity is 
80%. The debt that will have to be paid in 1 year is $10 million. The risk-free rate is  
5% per annum. In this case E0=3, sE=0.80, r=0.05, T=1, and D=10. 
Solving equations (24.3) and (24.4) as indicated in footnote 10 yields V0=12.40 
and sV=0.2123. The parameter d2 is 1.1408, so that the probability of default is  
N1-d22=0.127, or 12.7%. The market value of the debt is V0-E0, or 9.40. The  
present value of the promised payment on the debt is 10e-0.05*1=9.51. The 
expected loss on the debt is therefore 19.51-9.402>9.51, or about 1.2% of its 
no-default value.
The basic Merton model we have just presented has been extended in a number of ways. For example, one version of the model assumes that a default occurs whenever the  
value of the assets falls below a barrier level. Another allows payments on debt  instruments to be required at more than one time.
How well do the default probabilities produced by Merton’s model and its extensions 
correspond to actual default experience? The answer is that Merton’s model and its 
extensions produce a good ranking of default probabilities (risk-neutral or real-world). This means that a monotonic transformation can be used to convert the probability of default output from Merton’s model into a good estimate of either the real-world or  
risk-neutral default probability.
11 It may seem strange to take a default probability 
N1-d22 that is in theory a risk-neutral default probability (because it is calculated from 
an option-pricing model) and use it to estimate a real-world default probability. Given the nature of the calibration process we have just described, the underlying assumption is that the ranking of the risk-neutral default probabilities of different companies is the same as the ranking of their real-world default probabilities.
11 Moody’s KMV provides a service that transforms a default probability produced by Merton’s model into a 
real-world default probability (which it refers to as an expected default frequency, or EDF). CreditGrades use 
Merton’s model to estimate credit spreads, which are closely linked to risk-neutral default probabilities.24.7 CREDIT RISK IN DERIVATIVES TRANSACTIONS
In this section we consider how credit risk is quantified for bilaterally cleared  derivatives 
transactions. This topic was introduced in Chapter 9. Typically, bilaterally cleared 
 derivatives between two companies are governed by an International Swaps and  
Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master Agreement. For transactions between  financial 
institutions, regulations require that variation margin be exchanged and initial margin 
be posted with third parties. Initial margin is calculated so that it covers losses over a 10-day period with 99% confidence.
The Master Agreement defines the circumstances when an event of default occurs. For 
example, when one side fails to make payments on outstanding derivatives transactions as required or fails to post margin (i.e., collateral) as required or declares bankruptcy,  
there is an event of default. The other side then has the right to terminate all out-standing transactions. There are two circumstances when this is likely to lead to a loss for the nondefaulting party:
1. The total value of the transactions to the nondefaulting party is positive and greater than the collateral (if any) posted by the defaulting party. The nondefaulting party  
M24_HULL0654_11_GE_C24.indd   571 30/04/2021   17:40572 CHAPTER 24
is then an unsecured creditor for the value of the transactions minus the value of the 
collateral.
2. The total value of the transactions is positive to the defaulting party and the  collateral posted by the nondefaulting party is greater than this value. The 
 nondefaulting party is then an unsecured creditor for the return of the excess 
collateral it has posted.
For the purposes of our discussion, we ignore the bid–ask spread costs incurred by the nondefaulting party when it replaces the transactions it had with the defaulting party.
CVA and DVA
CVA and DVA were introduced in Chapter 9. A bank’s credit valuation adjustment (CVA) for a counterparty is the present value of the expected cost to the bank of a default  
by the counterparty. Its debit (or debt) valuation adjustment (DVA) is the present value of the expected cost to the counterparty of a default by the bank. The possibility of the bank defaulting is a benefit to the bank because it means that there is some possibility that the bank will not have to make payments as required on its derivatives. DVA, a cost to the counterparty, therefore increases the value of its derivatives portfolio to the bank.
The no-default value of outstanding transactions is their value assuming neither side 
will default. (Derivatives pricing models such as Black–Scholes–Merton provide no-  
default values.) If f
nd is the no-default value to the bank of its outstanding derivatives  
transactions with the counterparty, the value the outstanding transactions when  possible defaults are taken into account is
fnd-CVA+DVA
Suppose that the life of the longest outstanding derivative between the bank and the 
counterparty is T  years. As explained in Chapter 9, the interval between time 0 and 
time T is divided into N subintervals and CVA and DVA are estimated as
CVA=aN
i=1qivi, DVA=aN
i=1qi*vi*
Here qi is the risk-neutral probability of the counterparty defaulting during the ith 
interval, vi is the present value of the expected loss to the bank if the counterparty 
defaults at the midpoint of the ith interval, qi* is the risk-neutral probability of the bank 
defaulting during the ith interval, and vi* is the present value of the expected loss to the 
counterparty (gain to the bank) if the bank defaults at the midpoint of the ith interval.
Consider first the calculation of qi. Note that qi should be a risk-neutral default 
 probability because we are valuing future cash flows and (implicitly) using risk-neutral 
valuation (see Section 24.5). Suppose that ti is the end point of the ith interval, so that 
qi is the risk-neutral probability of a counterparty default between times ti-1 and ti. We  
first estimate credit spreads for the counterparty for a number of different maturities. Using interpolation, we then obtain an estimate, 
s1ti2, of the counterparty’s credit 
spread for maturity ti 11…i…N2. From equation (24.2), an estimate of the counter- 
party’s average hazard rate between times 0 and ti is s1ti2>11-R2, where R is the 
recovery rate expected in the event of a counterparty default. From equation (24.1), the  
M24_HULL0654_11_GE_C24.indd   572 30/04/2021   17:40Credit Risk 573
probability that the counterparty will not default by time ti is
exp a-s1ti2ti
1-Rb
This means that
qi=exp a-s1ti-12ti-1
1-Rb-expa-s1ti2ti
1-Rb
is the probability of the counterparty defaulting during the ith interval. The probability 
qi* is similarly calculated from the bank’s credit spreads.
Consider next the calculation of the vi assuming that no collateral is posted. This 
 usually requires a computationally very time consuming Monte Carlo simulation. The 
market variables determining the no-default value of the outstanding transactions between the bank and the counterparty are simulated in a risk-neutral world between time 0 and time T. On each simulation trial, the exposure of the bank to the counterparty  
at the midpoint of each interval is calculated. The exposure is equal to 
max1V, 02, where 
V is the total value of the transactions to the bank. (If the transactions in total have a  
negative value to the bank, there is no exposure; if they have a positive value, the exposure is equal to this positive value.) The variable 
vi is set equal to the present value of the 
average exposure across all simulation trials multiplied by one minus the recovery rate. The variable 
vi* is calculated similarly from the counterparty’s exposure to the bank.
When there is a collateral agreement between the bank and the counterparty, the 
calculation of vi is more complicated. It is necessary to estimate on each simulation trial 
the amount of collateral held by each side at the midpoint of the ith interval in the event  
of a default. In this calculation, it is usually assumed that the counterparty stops  posting collateral and stops returning any excess collateral held c days before a default. 
The parameter c, which is typically 10 or 20 days, is referred to as the cure period or margin period of risk. In order to know what collateral is held at the midpoint of an interval in the event of a default, it is necessary to calculate the value of transactions c days earlier. The way exposure is calculated is illustrated with the following example. The present value of the expected loss 
vi is calculated from the average exposure across  
all simulation trials as in the no-collateral case. A similar analysis of the average  exposure of the counterparty to the bank leads to 
vi*.
Example 24.4
There is a two-way zero-threshold collateral agreement between a bank and its 
(nonfinancial) counterparty. This means that each side is required to post collateral worth 
max1V, 02 with the other side, where V is the value of the outstanding 
transactions to the other side. The cure period is 20 days. Suppose that time t is the midpoint of one of the intervals used in the bank’s CVA calculation.
1. On a particular simulation trial, the value of outstanding transactions to the  
bank at time 
t is 50 and their value 20 days earlier is 45. In this case, the 
 calculation assumes that the bank has collateral worth 45 in the event of a 
default at time t. The bank’s exposure is the uncollateralized value it has in 
the derivatives transactions, or 5.
2. On a particular simulation trial the value of outstanding transactions to the bank at time 
t is 50 and their value 20 days earlier is 55. In this case, it is 
assumed that the bank will have adequate collateral and its exposure is zero.
M24_HULL0654_11_GE_C24.indd   573 30/04/2021   17:40574 CHAPTER 24
3. On a particular simulation trial the value of outstanding transactions to the 
bank at time t is -50 and the value 20 days earlier is -45. In this case, the  
bank is assumed to have posted less than 50 of collateral in the event of a default at time 
t and its exposure is zero.
4. On a particular simulation trial the value of outstanding transactions to the bank at time 
t is -50 and the value 20 days earlier is -55. In this case, it is 
assumed that 55 of collateral is held by the counterparty 20 days before time  
t and, in the event of a default at time t, none of it is returned. The bank’s 
exposure is therefore 5, the excess collateral it has posted.
In addition to calculating CVA, banks usually calculate peak exposure at the midpoint of each interval. This is a high percentile of the exposures given by the Monte Carlo simulation trials. For example, if the percentile is 97.5% and there are 10,000 Monte Carlo trials, the peak exposure at a particular midpoint is the 250th highest exposure at that point. The maximum peak exposure is the maximum of the peak exposures at all midpoints.
12
Banks usually store all the paths sampled for all market variables and all the 
 valuations calculated on each path. This enables the impact of a new transaction on 
CVA and DVA to be calculated relatively quickly. Only the value of the new transaction for each sample path needs to be calculated in order to determine its incremental effect on CVA and DVA. If the value of the new transaction is positively correlated to  existing 
transactions, it is likely to increase CVA and DVA. If it is negatively correlated to  
existing transactions (e.g., because it is wholly or partially unwinding those trans-actions), it is likely to decrease CVA and DVA.
The method for calculating CVA that we have presented assumes that the probability 
of default by the counterparty is independent of the bank’s exposure. This is a reason-able assumption in many situations. Traders use the term wrong-way risk to describe the  
situation where the probability of default is positively correlated with exposure and the  
term right-way risk to describe the situation where the probability of default is 
 negatively correlated with exposure. More complicated models than those we describe 
have been developed to describe dependence between default probability and exposure.
A bank has one CVA and one DVA for each of its counterparties. The CVAs and 
DVAs can be regarded as derivatives which change in value as market variables change, counterparty credit spreads change, and bank credit spreads change. The risks in CVA (and occasionally DVA) are managed in the same way as the risks in other derivatives using Greek letter calculations, scenario analyses, etc.
Credit Risk Mitigation
There are a number of ways banks try to reduce credit risk in bilaterally cleared trans-actions. One, which we have already mentioned, is netting. Suppose a bank has three uncollateralized transactions with a counterparty worth +$10 million, +$30 million, and - $25 million. If they are regarded as independent transactions, the bank’s exposure on 
the transactions is $10 million, $30 million, and $0 for a total exposure of $40 million. With netting, the transactions are regarded as a single transaction worth $15 million and the exposure is reduced from $40 million to $15 million.
12 There is a theoretical issue here (which is usually ignored). The peak exposure is a scenario analysis 
 measure and should be calculated using real-world default estimates rather than risk-neutral estimates.
M24_HULL0654_11_GE_C24.indd   574 30/04/2021   17:40Credit Risk 575
Business Snapshot 24.1 Downgrade Triggers and AIG
AIG provides an example of the operation of downgrade triggers. By 2008, AIG had 
entered into many derivatives transactions where it guaranteed the performance of the AAA-rated tranches of ABS CDOs. (See Chapter 8 for a description of ABS CDOs.) Many of AIG’s transactions had downgrade triggers stating that AIG did  
not have to post collateral provided its credit rating remained above AA. On  September 15, 2008, it was downgraded below AA by Moody’s, S&P , and Fitch. 
The tranches it had guaranteed were performing badly and it immediately received collateral calls from many counterparties. It was unable to meet the collateral calls and bankruptcy was avoided only by a massive government bailout.
Collateral agreements are an important way of reducing credit risk. Collateral can be 
either cash (which usually earns interest) or marketable securities. (The latter may be subject to a haircut to calculate their cash equivalent for collateral purposes.) Collateral agreements between financial institutions are now determined by regulation. Derivatives transactions receive favorable treatment in the event of a default. The  nondefaulting 
party is entitled to keep any collateral posted by the other side. Expensive and time-  
consuming legal proceedings are not usually necessary.
Another credit risk mitigation technique used by financial institutions is known as a  
downgrade trigger. This is a clause in the Master Agreement between a bank and a nonfinancial counterparty stating that if the credit rating of the counterparty falls below a certain level, say BBB, the bank has the option to require collateral or close out all outstanding derivatives transactions at market value. Downgrade triggers do not provide protection against a relatively big jump in a counterparty’s credit rating (e.g., from A to  
default). Moreover, they work well only if relatively little use is made of them. If the counterparty has many downgrade triggers with different derivatives dealers, they are likely to provide little protection to those dealers (see Business Snapshot 24.1).
Special Cases
In this section we consider two special cases where CVA can be calculated without Monte Carlo simulation.
The first special case is where the portfolio between the bank and the counterparty 
consists of a single uncollateralized derivative that provides a payoff to the bank at time T. (The bank could for instance have bought a European option with remaining 
life T from the counterparty.) The bank’s exposure at a future time is the no-default 
value of the derivative at that time. The present value of the exposure is therefore the  
present value of the derivative’s future value. This is the no-default value of the  derivative today. Hence
vi=fnd11-R2
for all i, where fnd is the no-default value of the derivative today and R is the recovery 
rate. This implies
CVA=11-R2fndaN
i=1qi
M24_HULL0654_11_GE_C24.indd   575 30/04/2021   17:40576 CHAPTER 24
In this case DVA=0, so that the value f of the derivative today after allowing for 
credit risk is
 f=fnd-11-R2fndaN
i=1qi (24.5)
One particular derivative of the type we are considering is a T-year zero-coupon bond 
issued by the counterparty. Assuming recoveries on the bond and the derivative are the same, the value of the bond, B, is
 
B=Bnd-11-R2BndaN
i=1qi (24.6)
where Bnd is the no-default value of the bond. From equations (24.5) and (24.6),
f
fnd=B
Bnd
If y is the yield on the T-year bond issued by the counterparty and ynd is the yield on a 
similar riskless bond, B=e-yT and Bnd=e-yndT, so that this equation gives
f=fnde-1y-ynd2T
This shows that the derivative can be valued by increasing the discount rate that is 
applied to the expected payoff in a risk-neutral world by the counterparty’s T-year credit spread.
Example 24.5
The Black–Scholes–Merton price of a 2-year uncollateralized option is $3. Two-
year zero-coupon bonds issued by the company selling the option have a yield 1.5% greater than the risk-free rate. The value of the option after default risk is considered is 
3e-0.015*2=+2.91. (This assumes that the option stands alone and 
is not netted with other derivatives in the event of default.)
For the second special case, we consider a bank that has entered into an uncollateral-ized forward transaction with a counterparty where it has agreed to buy an asset for price K at time T. The bank has no other transactions with the counterparty. Define 
Ft  
as the forward price at time t for delivery of the asset at time T. The value of the 
 transaction at time t is, from Section 5.7,
1Ft-K2e-r1T-t2
where r is the risk-free interest rate (assumed constant).
The bank’s exposure at time t is therefore
max31Ft-K2e-r1T-t2, 04=e-r1T-t2 max3Ft-K, 04
The expected value of Ft in a risk-neutral world is F0. The standard deviation of ln Ft is 
s2t, where s is the volatility of Ft. From equation (15A.1) the expected exposure at  
time t is therefore
w1t2=e-r1T-t23F0N1d11t22-K N1d21t224
M24_HULL0654_11_GE_C24.indd   576 30/04/2021   17:40Credit Risk 577
where
d11t2=ln1F0>K2+s2t>2
s2t, d21t2=d11t2-s2t
It follows that
vi=w1ti2e-rti 11-R2=e-rT 11-R23F0N1d11ti22-K N1d21ti224
Example 24.6
A bank has entered into a forward contract to buy 1 million ounces of gold from a 
mining company in 2 years for $1,500 per ounce. The current 2-year forward price  
is $1,600 per ounce. We suppose that only two intervals each 1-year long are considered in the calculation of CVA. The probability of the company defaulting  
during the first year is 2% and the probability that it will default during the  second year is 3%. The risk-free rate is 5% per annum. A 30% recovery in the 
event of default is anticipated. The volatility of the forward price of gold is 20%.
In this case, 
q1=0.02, q2=0.03, F0=1,600, K=1,500, s=0.2, r=0.05, 
R=0.3, t1=0.5, and t2=1.5.
 d11t12=ln11600>15002+0.22*0.5>2
0.220.5=0.5271
 d21t12=d1-0.220.5=0.3856
so that
v1=e-0.05*2.0*11-0.3231600N10.52712-1500N10.385624=92.67
Similarly v2=130.65.
The expected cost of defaults is
q1v1+q2v2=0.02*92.67+0.03*130.65=5.77
The no-default value of the forward contract is 11600-15002e-0.05*2=90.48. 
When counterparty defaults are considered, the value drops to 90.48 - 5.77 =  
84.71. The calculation can be extended to allow the times when the mining  company can default to be more frequent (see Problem 24.28). DVA, which 
increases the value of the derivative, can be calculated in a similar way to CVA (see Problem 24.29).
24.8 DEFAULT CORRELATION
The term default correlation is used to describe the tendency for two companies to 
default at about the same time. There are a number of reasons why default correlation exists. Companies in the same industry or the same geographic region tend to be  
affected similarly by external events and as a result may experience financial difficulties  
at the same time. Economic conditions generally cause average default rates to be higher in some years than in other years. A default by one company may cause a default by another—the credit contagion effect. Default correlation means that credit risk  cannot be completely diversified away and is the major reason why risk-neutral default 
probabilities are greater than real-world default probabilities (see Section 24.5).
M24_HULL0654_11_GE_C24.indd   577 30/04/2021   17:40578 CHAPTER 24
Default correlation is important in the determination of probability distributions for 
default losses from a portfolio of exposures to different counterparties.13 Two types of 
default correlation models that have been suggested by researchers are referred to as 
reduced form models and structural models.
Reduced form models assume that the hazard rates for different companies follow 
stochastic processes and are correlated with macroeconomic variables. When the  hazard 
rate for company A is high there is a tendency for the hazard rate for company B to be high. This induces a default correlation between the two companies.
Reduced form models are mathematically attractive and reflect the tendency for 
economic cycles to generate default correlations. Their main disadvantage is that the range of default correlations that can be achieved is limited. Even when there is a perfect correlation between the hazard rates of the two companies, the probability that they will both default during the same short period of time is usually very low. This is liable to be a problem in some circumstances. For example, when two companies operate in the same  
industry and the same country or when the financial health of one company is for some reason heavily dependent on the financial health of another company, a relatively high default correlation may be warranted. One approach to solving this problem is by extending the model so that the hazard rate exhibits large jumps.
Structural models are based on a model similar to Merton’s model (see Section 24.6). 
A company defaults if the value of its assets is below a certain level. Default  correlation 
between companies A and B is introduced into the model by assuming that the  
stochastic process followed by the assets of company A is correlated with the stochastic process followed by the assets of company B. Structural models have the advantage over reduced form models that the correlation can be made as high as desired. Their main disadvantage is that they are liable to be computationally quite slow.
The Gaussian Copula Model for Time to Default
A model that has become a popular practical tool is the Gaussian copula model for the time to default. It can be shown to be similar to Merton’s structural model. It assumes that all companies will default eventually and attempts to quantify the correlation between the  
probability distributions of the times to default for two or more different companies.
The model can be used in conjunction with either real-world or risk-neutral default 
probabilities. The left tail of the real-world probability distribution for the time to default of a company can be estimated from data produced by rating agencies such as that in Table 24.1. The left tail of the risk-neutral probability distribution of the time to 
default can be estimated from bond prices using the approach in Section 24.4.
Define 
t1 as the time to default of company 1 and t2 as the time to default of  
company 2. If the probability distributions of t1 and t2 were normal, we could assume 
that the joint probability distribution of t1 and t2 is bivariate normal. As it happens, the  
probability distribution of a company’s time to default is not even approximately  normal. This is where a Gaussian copula model comes in. We transform 
t1 and t2 into 
new variables x1 and x2 using
x1=N-13Q11t124,   x2=N-13Q21t224
13 A binomial correlation measure that has been used by rating agencies is described in Technical Note 26 at 
www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull/TechnicalNotes.
M24_HULL0654_11_GE_C24.indd   578 30/04/2021   17:40Credit Risk 579
where Q1 and Q2 are the cumulative probability distributions for t1 and t2, and N-1 is the 
inverse of the cumulative normal distribution ( u=N-11v2 when v=N1u2). These are 
“percentile-to-percentile” transformations. The 5-percentile point in the  probability 
distribution for t1 is transformed to x1=-1.645, which is the 5-percentile point in the 
standard normal distribution; the 10-percentile point in the probability distribution for t1  
is transformed to x1=-1.282, which is the 10-percentile point in the standard normal 
distribution; and so on. The t2-to-x2 transformation is similar.
By construction, x1 and x2 have normal distributions with mean zero and unit  
 standard deviation. The model assumes that the joint distribution of x1 and x2 is 
 bivariate normal. This assumption is referred to as using a Gaussian copula. The 
assumption is convenient because it means that the joint probability distribution of 
t1 and t2 is fully defined by the cumulative default probability distributions Q1 and Q2 
for t1 and t2, together with a single correlation parameter that defines the correlation 
between x1 and x2.
The attraction of the Gaussian copula model is that it can be extended to many 
 companies. Suppose that we are considering n  companies and that ti is the time to default 
of the i th company. We transform each ti into a new variable, xi, that has a standard 
normal distribution. The transformation is the percentile-to-percentile transformation
xi=N-13Qi1ti24
where Qi is the cumulative probability distribution for ti. It is then assumed that the xi 
are multivariate normal. The default correlation between ti and tj is measured as the 
correlation between xi and xj. This is referred to as the copula correlation.14
The Gaussian copula is a useful way of representing the correlation structure  
between variables that are not normally distributed. It allows the correlation  structure 
of the variables to be estimated separately from their marginal (unconditional) 
 distributions. Although the variables themselves are not multivariate normal, the  
approach assumes that after a transformation is applied to each variable they are 
 multivariate normal.
Example 24.7
Suppose that we wish to simulate defaults during the next 5 years in 10 com-
panies. The copula default correlations between each pair of companies is 0.2. For each company the cumulative probability of a default during the next 1, 2, 3, 4,  
5 years is 1%, 3%, 6%, 10%, 15%, respectively. When a Gaussian copula is used we sample from a multivariate normal distribution to obtain the 
xi 11…i…102 
with the pairwise correlation between the xi being 0.2. We then convert the xi  
to ti, a time to default. When the sample from the normal distribution is less than  
N-110.012=-2.33, a default takes place within the first year; when the sample is  
between -2.33 and N-110.032=-1.88, a default takes place during the second  
year; when the sample is between -1.88 and N-110.062=-1.55, a default takes  
place during the third year; when the sample is between -1.55 and N -1(0.10) = 
-1.28, a default takes place during the fourth year; when the sample is between 
-1.28 and N-110.152=-1.04, a default takes place during the fifth year. When 
the sample is greater than -1.04, there is no default during the 5 years.
14 As an approximation, the copula correlation between ti and tj is often assumed to be the correlation 
between the equity returns for companies i and j.
M24_HULL0654_11_GE_C24.indd   579 30/04/2021   17:40580 CHAPTER 24
A Factor-Based Correlation Structure
To avoid defining a different correlation between xi and xj for each pair of companies i 
and j in the Gaussian copula model, a one-factor model is often used. The assumption 
is that
 xi=aiF+21-a2
i Zi (24.7)
In this equation, F is a common factor affecting defaults for all companies and Zi is a 
factor affecting only company i. The variable F and the variables Zi have independent 
standard normal distributions. The ai are constant parameters between -1 and +1. The 
correlation between xi and xj is ai aj.15
Suppose that the probability that company i will default by a particular time T  
is Qi1T2. Under the Gaussian copula model, a default happens by time T when 
N1xi26Qi1T2 or xi6N-13Qi1T24. From equation (24.7), this condition is
aiF+21-a2
i Zi6N-13Qi1T24
or
Zi6N-13Qi1T24-aiF
21-a2
i
Conditional on the value of the factor F, the probability of default is therefore
 Qi1T /H20841 F2=NaN-13Qi1T24-aiF
21-a2
ib (24.8)
A particular case of the one-factor Gaussian copula model is where the probability 
distributions of default are the same for all i and the correlation between xi and xj is the  
same for all i  and j . Suppose that Qi1T2=Q1T2 for all i  and that the common 
 correlation is r, so that ai=2r for all i. Equation (24.8) becomes
 Q1T /H20841 F2=N aN-13Q1T24-2r F
21-rb (24.9)
15 The parameter ai is sometimes approximated as the correlation of company i’s equity returns with a well- 
diversified market index.24.9 CREDIT V aR
Credit value at risk can be defined analogously to the way value at risk is defined for market risks (see Chapter 22). For example, a credit VaR with a confidence level of 99.9% and a 1-year time horizon is the credit loss that we are 99.9% confident will not be exceeded over 1 year.
Consider a bank with a very large portfolio of similar loans. As an approximation, 
assume that the probability of default is the same for each loan and the correlation between each pair of loans is the same. When the Gaussian copula model for time to  
default is used, the right-hand side of equation (24.9) is to a good approximation equal to the percentage of defaults by time T as a function of F. The factor F has a standard  
normal distribution. We are X% certain that its value will be greater than 
N-111-X2=-N-11X2. We are therefore X% certain that the percentage of losses  
M24_HULL0654_11_GE_C24.indd   580 30/04/2021   17:40Credit Risk 581
over T years on a large portfolio will be less than V1X, T2, where
 V1X, T2=NaN-13Q1T24+2r N-11X2
21-rb (24.10)
This result was first produced by Vasicek.16 As in equation (24.9), Q1T2 is the 
 probability of default by time T and r is the copula correlation between any pair of 
loans.
A rough estimate of the credit VaR when an X% confidence level is used and the time  
horizon is T is therefore L11-R2V1X, T2, where L is the size of the loan portfolio and  
R is the recovery rate. The contribution of a particular loan of size Li to the credit VaR 
is Li11-R2V1X, T2. This model underlies some of the formulas that regulators use for  
credit risk capital.17
Example 24.8
Suppose that a bank has a total of $100 million of retail exposures. The 1-year 
probability of default averages 2% and the recovery rate averages 60%. The  
copula correlation parameter is estimated as 0.1. In this case,
V10.999, 12=N aN-110.022+20.1N-110.9992
21-0.1b=0.128
showing that the 99.9% worst case default rate is 12.8%. The 1-year 99.9% credit VaR is therefore 
100*0.128*11-0.62 or $5.13 million.
CreditMetrics
Many banks have developed other procedures for calculating credit VaR. One popular approach is known as CreditMetrics. This involves estimating a probability distribution of credit losses by carrying out a Monte Carlo simulation of the credit rating changes of  
all counterparties. Suppose we are interested in determining the probability distribution  
of losses over a 1-year period. On each simulation trial, we sample to determine the credit  
rating changes and defaults of all counterparties during the year. We then revalue our outstanding contracts to determine the total of credit losses for the year. After a large number of simulation trials, a probability distribution for credit losses is obtained. This can be used to calculate credit VaR.
This approach is liable to be computationally quite time intensive. However, it has the  
advantage that credit losses are defined as those arising from credit downgrades as well as defaults (with credit upgrades being counted as negative losses). Also the impact of credit mitigation clauses such as those described in Section 24.7 can be approximately incorporated into the analysis.
Table 24.4 is typical of the historical data provided by rating agencies on credit rating 
changes and could be used as a basis for a CreditMetrics Monte Carlo simulation. It shows the percentage probability of a bond moving from one rating category to another during a 1-year period. For example, a bond that starts with an A credit rating has

Wiley, 2018.16 See O. Vasicek, “Probability of Loss on a Loan Portfolio,” Working Paper, KMV, 1987. Vasicek’s results 
were published in Risk magazine in December 2002 under the title “Loan Portfolio Value”.
M24_HULL0654_11_GE_C24.indd   581 30/04/2021   17:40582 CHAPTER 24
a 92.49% chance of still having an A rating at the end of 1 year. It has a 0.05% chance 
of defaulting during the year, a 5.27% chance of dropping to BBB, and so on.18
In sampling to determine credit losses, the credit rating changes for different counter- 
parties should not be assumed to be independent. A Gaussian copula model is typically  
used to construct a joint probability distribution of rating changes similarly to the way  
it is used in the model in the previous section to describe the joint probability  
distribution of times to default. The copula correlation between the rating transitions for two companies is usually set equal to the correlation between their equity returns using a factor model similar to that in Section 24.8.
As an illustration of the CreditMetrics approach suppose that we are simulating  
the rating change of a AAA and a BBB company over a 1-year period using the transition  
matrix in Table 24.4. Suppose that the correlation between the equities of the two 
companies is 0.2. On each simulation trial, we would sample two variables 
xA and xB  
from normal distributions so that their correlation is 0.2. The variable xA determines 
the new rating of the AAA company and the variable xB determines the new rating of  
the BBB company. Since N-110.89832=1.2719, the AAA company stays AAA if  
xA61.2719; since N-110.8983+0.09372=2.4089, it becomes AA if 1.2719…xA6 
2.4089; since N-110.8983+0.0937+0.00552=2.8070, it becomes A if 2.4089…xA6 
2.8070; and so on. Consider next the BBB company. Since N-110.00012=-3.7190, the  
BBB company becomes AAA if xB6-3.7190; since N-110.0001+0.00102=-3.0618,  
it becomes AA if -3.7190…xB6-3.0618; since N-110.0001+0.0010+0.03592=
-1.7866, it becomes A if -1.7866…xB6-3.0618; and so on. The AAA never defaults 
during the year. The BBB defaults when xB7N-110.99832, that is, when xB72.9290.
SUMMARY
The probability that a company will default during a particular period of time in the future can be estimated from historical data, bond prices, or equity prices. The default probabilities calculated from bond prices are risk-neutral probabilities; those calculated Initial  ratingRating at year-end

from historical data are real-world probabilities; equity prices can be used to estimate 
either real-world or risk-neutral probabilities. Real-world probabilities should be used for scenario analysis and the calculation of credit VaR. Risk-neutral probabilities  
should be used for valuing credit-sensitive instruments. Risk-neutral default probabil-ities are often significantly higher than real-world default probabilities.
The credit valuation adjustment (CVA) is the amount by which a bank reduces the 
value of a derivatives portfolio with a counterparty because of the possibility of the  
counterparty defaulting. The debt (or debit) valuation adjustment (DVA) is the amount by  
which it increases the value of a portfolio because it might itself default. The calculation of CVA and DVA involves a time-consuming Monte Carlo simulation to determine the expected future exposures of the two sides of the portfolio.
Credit VaR can be defined similarly to the way VaR is defined for market risk. One 
approach to calculating it is the Gaussian copula model of time to default. This is used by regulators in the calculation of capital for credit risk. Another popular approach for calculating credit VaR is CreditMetrics. This uses a Gaussian copula model for credit rating changes.

Scholes–Merton overstate the value of a 3-year European option sold by the corporation.
 24.22. Give an example of (a) right-way risk and (b) wrong-way risk.
 24.23. The credit spreads for 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year zero-coupon bonds are 50, 60, 70, 80, and 
87 basis points, respectively. The recovery rate is 35%. Estimate the average hazard rate each year.
 24.24. Suppose a 3-year corporate bond provides a coupon of 7% per year payable semiannually 
and has a yield of 5% (expressed with semiannual compounding). The yields for all  
maturities on risk-free bonds is 4% per annum (expressed with semiannual compound-  
ing). Assume that defaults can take place every 6 months (immediately before a coupon payment) and the recovery rate is 45%. Estimate the hazard rate (assumed constant) for  
the three years. Assume that the probability of default immediately before a coupon payment is the default probability given by the hazard rate for the previous six months.
 24.25. Explain carefully the distinction between real-world and risk-neutral default probabil- 
ities. Which is higher? A bank enters into a credit derivative where it agrees to pay $100 at the end of 1 year if a certain company’s credit rating falls from A to BBB or lower during the year. The 1-year risk-free rate is 5%. Using Table 24.4, estimate a value for  
the derivative. What assumptions are you making? Do they tend to overstate or under-state the value of the derivative.
 24.26. The value of a company’s equity is $4 million and the volatility of its equity is 60%. The  
debt that will have to be repaid in 2 years is $15 million. The risk-free interest rate is 6%

Credit Derivatives
Credit derivatives began trading in the over-the-counter market in the late 1990s. In 
2000, the total notional principal for outstanding credit derivatives contracts was about $800 billion. By the financial crisis of 2007, this had become $50 trillion. After the  crisis, 
the size of the market declined. The total notional principal was about $7.5 trillion in  
December 2019. Credit derivatives are contracts where the payoff depends on the  
creditworthiness of one or more companies or countries. This chapter explains how credit derivatives work and how they are valued.
Credit derivatives allow companies to trade credit risks in much the same way that they  
trade market risks. Banks and other financial institutions used to be in the position where  
they could do little once they had assumed a credit risk except wait (and hope for the best). Now they can actively manage their portfolios of credit risks, keeping some and entering into credit derivative contracts to protect themselves from others (see  Business  
Snapshot 25.1). Banks have historically been the biggest buyers of credit protection and 
insurance companies have been the biggest sellers.
Credit derivatives can be categorized as “single-name” or “multi-name.” The most 
popular single-name credit derivative is a credit default swap. The payoff from this instrument depends on the creditworthiness of one company or country. There are two  
sides to the contract: the buyer and seller of protection. There is a payoff from the  
seller of protection to the buyer of protection if the specified entity (company or  
country) defaults on its obligations. One multi-name credit derivative is a  collateralized 
debt obligation. In this, a portfolio of debt instruments is specified and a complex  s tructure is created where the cash flows from the portfolio are channelled to different 
 categories of investors. Chapter 8 describes how multi-name credit derivatives were 
created from residential mortgages during the period leading up to the financial crisis. This chapter focuses on the situation where the underlying credit risks are those of corporations or countries.
The chapter starts by explaining how credit default swaps work and how they are 
valued. It then explains credit indices and the way in which traders can use them to buy protection on a portfolio. After that it moves on to cover basket credit default swaps, asset-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations. It expands on the material in Chapter 24 to show how the Gaussian copula model of default correlation can be used to value tranches of collateralized debt obligations.25 CHAPTER

Business Snapshot 25.1 Who Bears the Credit Risk?
Traditionally banks have been in the business of making loans and then bearing the 
credit risk that the borrower will default. However, banks have for some time been reluctant to keep loans on their balance sheets. This is because, after the capital required by regulators has been accounted for, the average return earned on loans is  
often less attractive than that on other assets. As discussed in Section 8.1 , banks  
created asset-backed securities to pass loans (and their credit risk) on to investors. In  
the late 1990s and early 2000s, banks also made extensive use of credit derivatives to shift the credit risk in their loans to other parts of the financial system.
The result of all this is that the financial institution bearing the credit risk of a loan 
is often different from the financial institution that did the original credit checks. As the financial crisis starting in 2007 has shown, this is not always good for the overall health of the financial system.
The most popular credit derivative is a credit default swap (CDS). This was introduced 
in Section 7.11. It is a contract that provides insurance against the risk of a default by particular company. The company is known as the reference entity and a default by the company is known as a credit event. The buyer of the insurance obtains the right to sell bonds issued by the company for their face value when a credit event occurs and the seller of the insurance agrees to buy the bonds for their face value when a credit event occurs.
1 The total face value of the bonds that can be sold is known as the credit default 
swap’s notional principal.
The buyer of the CDS makes periodic payments to the seller until the end of the life of  
the CDS or until a credit event occurs. In a standard contract, payments are made in arrears every quarter, but deals where payments are made every month, 6 months, or  
12 months or where payments are made in advance occasionally also occur. The settle-ment in the event of a default usually involves a cash payment.
An example will help to illustrate how a typical deal is structured. Suppose that two  
parties enter into a 5-year credit default swap on March 20, 2020. Assume that the notional principal is $100 million and the buyer agrees to pay 90 basis points per annum  
for protection against default by the reference entity, with payments being made  
quarterly in arrears.
The CDS is shown in Figure 25.1. If the reference entity does not default (i.e., there is  
no credit event), the buyer receives no payoff and pays 22.5 basis points (a quarter of 90 basis points) on $100 million on June 20, 2020, and every quarter thereafter until March 20, 2025. The amount paid each quarter is 
0.00225*100,000,000, or $225,000.2 
If there is a credit event, a substantial payoff is likely. Suppose that the buyer notifies the  
seller of a credit event on May 20, 2023 (2 months into the fourth year). If the contract 25.1 CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS
1  The face value (or par value) of a coupon-bearing bond is the principal amount that the issuer repays at 
maturity if it does not default.
2  The quarterly payments are liable to be slightly different from $225,000 because of the application of the 
day count conventions described in Chapter 6.

specifies physical settlement, the buyer has the right to sell bonds issued by the reference  
entity with a face value of $100 million for $100 million. If, as is now usual, there is cash 
settlement, an ISDA-organized auction process is used to determine the mid-market value of the cheapest deliverable bond several days after the credit event. Suppose the auction indicates that the bond is worth $35 per $100 of face value. The cash payoff  would be $65 million.
The regular payments from the buyer of protection to the seller of protection cease 
when there is a credit event. However, because these payments are made in arrears, a final accrual payment by the buyer is usually required. In our example, where there is a  
default on May 20, 2023, the buyer would be required to pay to the seller the amount of  
the annual payment accrued between March 20, 2023, and May 20, 2023 (approxi-mately $150,000), but no further payments would be required.
The total amount paid per year, as a percent of the notional principal, to buy  
protection (90 basis points in our example) is known as the CDS spread. Several large 
banks are market makers in the credit default swap market. When quoting on a new 5-year credit default swap on a company, a market maker might bid 250 basis points  
and ask 260 basis points. This means that the market maker is prepared to buy  
protection by paying 250 basis points per year (i.e., 2.5% of the principal per year)  
and to sell protection for 260 basis points per year (i.e., 2.6% of the principal per  
year).
Many different companies and countries are reference entities for the CDS contracts 
that trade. As mentioned, payments are usually made quarterly in arrears. Contracts with maturities of 5 years are most popular, but other maturities such as 1, 2, 3, 7, and 10 years are also sometimes used. Usually contracts mature on one of the following standard dates: March 20, June 20, September 20, and December 20. The effect of this is that the actual time to maturity of a contract when it is initiated is close to, but not necessarily the same as, the number of years to maturity that is specified. Suppose you  
call a dealer on November 18, 2021, to buy 5-year protection on a company. The  
contract would probably last until December 20, 2026. Your first payment would be  
due on December 20, 2021, and would equal an amount covering the November 18, 2021, to December 20, 2021, period.
3 A key aspect of a CDS contract is the definition of  
a credit event (i.e., a default). Usually a credit event is defined as a failure to make a payment as it becomes due, a restructuring of debt, or a bankruptcy. Restructuring is sometimes excluded in North American contracts, particularly in situations where the yield on the reference entity’s debt is high. More information on the CDS market is given in Business Snapshot 25.2.Figure 25.1 Credit default swap.

Credit Default Swaps and Bond Yields
A CDS can be used to hedge a position in a corporate bond. Suppose that an investor 
buys a 5-year corporate bond yielding 7% per year for its face value and at the same  Business Snapshot 25.2 The CDS Market
In 1998 and 1999, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA)  
developed a standard contract for trading credit default swaps in the over-the- counter market. Since then the market has grown in popularity. A CDS contract is  
like an insurance contract in many ways, but there is one key difference. An  insurance   
contract provides protection against losses on an asset that is owned by the protec-  
tion buyer. In the case of a CDS, the underlying asset does not have to be owned.
During the credit turmoil of 2007 and 2008, regulators became very concerned 
about systemic risk (see Business Snapshot 1.2 ). They felt that credit default swaps  
were a source of vulnerability for financial markets. The danger is that a default by one  
financial institution might lead to big losses by its counterparties in CDS  transactions  
and further defaults by other financial institutions. Regulatory concerns were fueled  
by troubles at insurance giant AIG. This was a big seller of protection on the AAA- 
rated tranches created from mortgages (see Business Snapshot 24.1). The protection  
proved very costly to AIG and the company was bailed out by the U.S. government.
During 2007 and 2008, trading ceased in many types of credit derivatives, but CDSs  
continued to trade actively (although the cost of protection increased dramatically). The advantage of CDSs over some other credit derivatives is that the way they work is  
straightforward. Other credit derivatives, such as those created from the securitization  
of household mortgages (see Chapter 8 ), lack this transparency.
It is not uncommon for the volume of CDSs on a company to be greater than its 
debt. Cash settlement of contracts is then clearly necessary. When Lehman defaulted in September 2008, there was about $400 billion of CDS contracts and $155 billion of  
Lehman debt outstanding. The cash payout to the buyers of protection (determined by  
an ISDA auction process) was 91.375% of principal.
There is one important difference between credit default swaps and the other over-
the-counter derivatives that we have considered in this book. The other over-the- counter derivatives depend on interest rates, exchange rates, equity indices, commodity  
prices, and so on. There is no reason to assume that any one market participant has  
better information than any other market participant about these variables.
Credit default swaps spreads depend on the probability that a particular company  
will default during a particular period of time. Arguably some market participants  
have more information to estimate this probability than others. A financial institu-  
tion that works closely with a particular company by providing advice, making  
loans, and handling new issues of securities is likely to have more information about  
the creditworthiness of the company than another financial institution that has no  
dealings with the company. Economists refer to this as an asymmetric information   
problem. Financial institutions emphasize that the decision to buy protection against  
the risk of default by a company is normally made by a risk manager and is not  
based on any special information that may exist elsewhere in the financial institution about the company.
M25_HULL0654_11_GE_C25.indd   590 30/04/2021   17:41Credit Derivatives 591
time enters into a 5-year CDS to buy protection against the issuer of the bond  
defaulting. Suppose that the CDS spread is 200 basis points, or 2%, per annum. The  
effect of the CDS is to convert the corporate bond to a risk-free bond (at least  
approximately). If the bond issuer does not default, the investor earns 5% per year 
when the CDS spread is netted against the corporate bond yield. If the bond does default, the investor earns 5% up to the time of the default. Under the terms of the CDS, the investor is then able to exchange the bond for its face value. This face value can be invested at the risk-free rate for the remainder of the 5 years.
This shows that the spread of the yield on an n -year bond issued by a company over the  
risk-free rate should approximately equal the company’s n-year CDS spread. If it is  
markedly more than this, an investor can earn more than the risk-free rate by buying the corporate bond and buying protection. If it is markedly less than this, an investor can  
borrow at less than the risk-free rate by shorting the bond and selling CDS protection.
The CDS–bond basis is defined as
CDS–
bond basis=CDS spread-Bond yield spread
The bond yield spread has traditionally been calculated as the excess of the bond yield over the relevant LIBOR/swap rate.
The arbitrage argument given above suggests that the CDS–bond basis should be 
close to zero. In fact it tends to be positive during some periods (e.g., pre-2007) and negative during other periods (e.g., the 2007–2009 financial crisis). The sign of the  
CDS–bond basis since the financial crisis has depended on the reference entity and has been sometimes positive and sometimes negative.
The Cheapest-to-Deliver Bond
As explained in Section 24.3, the recovery rate on a bond is defined as the value of the bond immediately after default as a percent of face value. This means that the payoff  from a CDS is 
L11-R2, where L is the notional principal and R is the recovery rate.
Usually a CDS specifies that a number of different bonds can be delivered in the event  
of a default. The bonds typically have the same seniority, but they may not sell for the same percentage of face value immediately after a default.
4 This gives the holder of a CDS  
a cheapest-to-deliver bond option. As already mentioned, an auction process, organized  
by ISDA, is usually used to determine the value of the cheapest-to-deliver bond and, therefore, the payoff to the buyer of protection.
The CDS spread for a particular reference entity can be calculated from default 
 probability estimates. We will illustrate how this is done for a 5-year CDS.
Suppose that the hazard rate of the reference entity is 2% per annum for the whole of  
the 5-year life of the CDS. Table 25.1 shows survival probabilities and unconditional 
probabilities of default. From equation (24.1), the probability of survival to time t  25.2 VALUATION OF CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS
4  There are a number of reasons for this. The claim that is made in the event of a default is typically equal to 
the bond’s face value plus accrued interest. Bonds with high accrued interest at the time of default therefore  
tend to have higher prices immediately after default. Also the market may judge that in the event of a  
reorganization of the company some bond holders will fare better than others.
M25_HULL0654_11_GE_C25.indd   591 30/04/2021   17:41592 CHAPTER 25
is e-0.02t. The probability of default during a year is the probability of survival to the  
beginning of the year minus the probability of survival to the end of the year. For 
example, the probability of survival to time 2 years is e-0.02*2=0.9608 and the  
probability of survival to time 3 years is e-0.02*3=0.9418. The probability of default 
during the third year is 0.9608-0.9418=0.0190.
We will assume that defaults always happen halfway through a year and that payments  
on the credit default swap are made once a year, at the end of each year. We also assume that the risk-free interest rate is 5% per annum with continuous compounding and the  
recovery rate is 40%. There are three parts to the calculation. These are shown in  
Tables 25.2, 25.3, and 25.4.
Table 25.2 shows the calculation of the present value of the expected payments made  
on the CDS assuming that payments are made at the rate of s  per year and the notional  
principal is $1. For example, there is a 0.9418 probability that the third payment of s  is  
made. The expected payment is therefore 0.9418s  and its present value is 
0.9418se-0.05*3=0.8106s. The total present value of the expected payments is 4.0728s.
Table 25.3 shows the calculation of the present value of the expected payoff assuming 
a notional principal of $1. As mentioned earlier, we are assuming that defaults always happen halfway through a year. For example, there is a 0.0190 probability of a payoff  halfway through the third year. Given that the recovery rate is 40%, the expected payoff   
at this time is 
0.0190*0.6*1=0.0114. The present value of the expected payoff is 
0.0114e-0.05*2.5=0.0101. The total present value of the expected payoffs is $0.0506.Table 25.1  Unconditional default probabilities

As a final step, Table 25.4 considers the accrual payment made in the event of a default.  
For example, there is a 0.0190 probability that there will be a final accrual payment 
halfway through the third year. The accrual payment is 0.5s. The expected accrual payment at this time is therefore 
0.0190*0.5s=0.0095s. Its present value is 
0.0095se-0.05*2.5=0.0084s. The total present value of the expected accrual payments 
is 0.0422s.
From Tables 25.2 and 25.4, the present value of the expected payments is
4.0728s+0.0422s=4.1150s
From Table 25.3, the present value of the expected payoff is 0.0506. Equating the two gives
4.1150s=0.0506
or s=0.0123. The mid-market CDS spread for the 5-year deal we have considered 
should be 0.0123 times the principal or 123 basis points per year. This result can also be produced using the DerivaGem CDS worksheet.
The calculations assume that defaults happen only at points midway between 
 payment dates. This simple assumption usually gives good results, but can easily be 
relaxed so that more default times are considered.Table 25.3  Calculation of the present value of expected payoff.

Marking to Market a CDS
A CDS, like most other derivatives, is revalued (i.e., marked to market) daily. It may have  
a positive or negative value. Suppose, for example the credit default swap in our example  
had been negotiated some time ago for a spread of 150 basis points, the present value of 
the payments by the buyer would be 4.1150*0.0150=0.0617 and the present value of 
the payoff would be 0.0506 as above. The value of swap to the seller would therefore be 
0.0617-0.0506, or 0.0111 times the principal. Similarly the marked-to-market value of 
the swap to the buyer of protection would be -0.0111 times the principal.
Estimating Default Probabilities
The default probabilities used to value a CDS should be risk-neutral default prob-abilities, not real-world default probabilities (see Section 24.5 for the difference between the two). Risk-neutral default probabilities can be estimated from bond prices as  
explained in Chapter 24. An alternative is to imply them from CDS quotes. The latter  
approach is similar to the practice in options markets of implying volatilities from the prices of actively traded options and using them to value other options.
Suppose we change the example in Tables 25.2, 25.3, and 25.4 so that we do not know  
the default probabilities. Instead we know that the mid-market CDS spread for a newly issued 5-year CDS is 100 basis points per year. We can reverse-engineer our calculations  
(using Excel in conjunction with Solver) to conclude that the implied hazard rate is 1.63% per year.
The DerivaGem software can be used to calculate a term structure of hazard rates from  
a term structure of CDS spreads or vice versa.
Binary Credit Default Swaps
A binary credit default swap is structured similarly to a regular credit default swap except that the payoff is a fixed dollar amount. Suppose that, in the example we  
considered in Tables 25.1 to 25.4, the payoff is $1 instead of 
1-R dollars and the  
swap spread is s. Tables 25.1, 25.2 and 25.4 are the same, but Table 25.3 is replaced by 
Table 25.5. The CDS spread for a new binary CDS is given by 4.1150s=0.0844, so that 
the CDS spread s is 0.0205, or 205 basis points.

How Important Is the Recovery Rate?
Whether we use CDS spreads or bond prices to estimate default probabilities we need 
an estimate of the recovery rate. However, provided that we use the same recovery rate for (a) estimating risk-neutral default probabilities and (b) valuing a CDS, the value of the CDS (or the estimate of the CDS spread) is not very sensitive to the recovery rate. This is because the implied probabilities of default are approximately proportional to 
1>11-R2 and the payoffs from a CDS are proportional to 1-R.
This argument does not apply to the valuation of binary CDS. Implied probabilities of  
default are still approximately proportional to 1>11-R2. However, for a binary CDS, the  
payoffs from the CDS are independent of R. If we have a CDS spread for both a plain  
vanilla CDS and a binary CDS, we can estimate both the recovery rate and the default probability (see Problem 25.25).
Participants in credit markets have developed indices to track credit default swap spreads.  
In 2004 there were agreements between different producers of indices that led to some 
consolidation. Two important standard portfolios used by index providers are:
1. CDX NA IG, a portfolio of 125 investment grade companies in North America
2. iTraxx Europe, a portfolio of 125 investment grade names in Europe
These portfolios are updated on March 20 and September 20 each year. Companies that are no longer investment grade are dropped from the portfolios and new investment grade companies are added.
5
Suppose that the 5-year CDX NA IG index is quoted by a market maker as bid  
65 basis points, ask 66 basis points per dollar of notional principal. (This is referred to as the index spread.) Roughly speaking, this means that a trader can buy CDS protection on all 125 companies in the index for 66 basis points per company. Suppose a trader wants $800,000 of protection on each company. The total cost is 
0.0066*800,000*125, or  
$660,000 per year. The trader can similarly sell $800,000 of protection on each of the 125  
companies for a total of $650,000 per annum. When a company defaults, the  protection  
buyer receives the usual CDS payoff and the annual payment is reduced by 
660,000>125=+5,280. The most common maturity for an index CDS is 5 years, but 
contracts also trade with maturities of 3, 7, and 10 years. The maturity dates for these types of contracts on the index are usually December 20 and June 20. (This means that a  
“5-year” contract actually lasts between 
43
4 and 51
4 years.) Roughly speaking, the index is  
the average of the CDS spreads on the companies in the underlying portfolio.625.3 CREDIT INDICES
5  On September 20, 2020, the Series 34 iTraxx Europe portfolio and the Series 35 CDX NA IG portfolio were 
defined. The series numbers indicate that, by the end of September 2020, the iTraxx Europe portfolio had 
been updated 33 times and the CDX NA IG portfolio had been updated 34 times.
6 More precisely, the index is slightly lower than the average of the credit default swap spreads for the  
companies in the portfolio. To understand the reason for this consider a portfolio consisting of two companies, one with a spread of 1,000 basis points and the other with a spread of 10 basis points. To buy protection on the companies would cost slightly less than 505 basis points per company. This is because the 1,000 basis points is  
not expected to be paid for as long as the 10 basis points and should therefore carry less weight. Another complication for CDX NA IG, but not iTraxx Europe, is that the definition of default applicable to the index includes restructuring, whereas the definition for CDS contracts on the underlying companies may not.
M25_HULL0654_11_GE_C25.indd   595 30/04/2021   17:42596 CHAPTER 25
The precise way in which CDS and CDS index transactions work is a little more  
complicated than has been described up to now. For each underlying and each  
maturity, a coupon and a recovery rate are specified. A price is calculated from the 
quoted spread using the following procedure:
1. Assume four payments per year, made in arrears.
2. Imply a hazard rate from the quoted spread. This involves calculations similar to 
those in Section 25.2. An iterative search is used to determine the hazard rate that leads to the quoted spread.
3. Calculate a “duration” D for the CDS payments. This is the number that the  
spread is multiplied by to get the present value of the spread payments. (In the example in Section 25.2, it is 4.1150.)

4. The price P  is given by P=100-100*D*1s-c2, where s  is the spread and c  is  
the coupon expressed in decimal form.
When a trader buys protection the trader pays 100-P per $100 of the total  remaining 
notional and the seller of protection receives this amount. (If 100-P is negative, the 
buyer of protection receives money and the seller of protection pays money.) The buyer of  
protection then pays the coupon times the remaining notional on each payment date. (On  
a CDS, the remaining notional is the original notional until default and zero thereafter. 
For a CDS index, the remaining notional is the number of names in the index that have not yet defaulted multiplied by the principal per name.) The payoff when there is a default is calculated in the usual way. This arrangement facilitates trading because the instruments trade like bonds. The regular quarterly payments made by the buyer of protection are independent of the spread at the time the buyer enters into the contract.
Example 25.1
Suppose that the iTraxx Europe index quote is 34 basis points and the coupon is  
40 basis points for a contract lasting exactly 5 years, with both quotes being 
expressed using an actual∙360 day count. (This is the usual day count convention in CDS and CDS index markets.) The equivalent actual/actual quotes are 0.345% for the index and 0.406% for the coupon. Suppose that the yield curve is flat at  
4% per year (actual/actual, continuously compounded). The specified recovery rate is 40%. With four payments per year in arrears, the implied hazard rate is 0.5717%. The duration is 4.447 years. The price is therefore
100-100*4.447*10.00345-0.004062=100.27
Consider a contract where protection is $1 million per name. Initially, the seller of  
protection would pay the buyer +1,000,000*125*0.0027. Thereafter, the buyer  
of protection would make quarterly payments in arrears at an annual rate of 
+1,000,000*0.00406*n, where n is the number of companies that have not 
defaulted. When a company defaults, the payoff is calculated in the usual way  
and there is an accrual payment from the buyer to the seller calculated at the rate of 0.406% per year on $1 million.25.4 THE USE OF FIXED COUPONS

8 The valuation of these instruments is discussed in J. C. Hull and A. White, “The Valuation of Credit  
Default Swap Options, ” Journal of Derivatives, 10, 5 (Spring 2003): 40–50.Once the CDS market was well established, it was natural for derivatives dealers to 
trade forwards and options on credit default swap spreads.8
A forward credit default swap is the obligation to buy or sell a particular credit 
default swap on a particular reference entity at a particular future time T. If the  
reference entity defaults before time T, the forward contract ceases to exist. Thus a  
bank could enter into a forward contract to sell 5-year protection on a company for  
280 basis points starting in 1 year. If the company defaulted before the 1-year point, the forward contract would cease to exist.
A credit default swap option is an option to buy or sell a particular credit default 
swap on a particular reference entity at a particular future time T. For example, a trader could negotiate the right to buy 5-year protection on a company starting in 1 year for 280 basis points. This is a call option. If the 5-year CDS spread for the company in  
1 year turns out to be more than 280 basis points, the option will be exercised;  
otherwise it will not be exercised. The cost of the option would be paid up front.  
Similarly an investor might negotiate the right to sell 5-year protection on a company for 280 basis points starting in 1 year. This is a put option. If the 5-year CDS spread for  
the company in 1 year turns out to be less than 280 basis points, the option will be  
exercised; otherwise it will not be exercised. Again the cost of the option would be paid up front. Like CDS forwards, CDS options are usually structured so that they cease to exist if the reference entity defaults before option maturity.25.5 CDS FORWARDS AND OPTIONS
In what is referred to as a basket credit default swap there are a number of reference entities. An add-up basket CDS provides a payoff when any of the reference entities default. A first-to-default CDS provides a payoff only when the first default occurs. A second-to-default CDS provides a payoff only when the second default occurs. More generally, a kth-to-default CDS provides a payoff only when the kth default occurs. Payoffs are calculated in the same way as for a regular CDS. After the relevant default has occurred, there is a settlement. The swap then terminates and there are no further payments by either party.25.6 BASKET CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS
A total return swap is a type of credit derivative. It is an agreement to exchange the 
total return on a bond (or any portfolio of assets) for a floating rate plus a spread. The total return includes coupons, interest, and the gain or loss on the asset over the life of the swap.
An example of a total return swap is a 5-year agreement with a notional principal of 
$100 million to exchange the total return on a corporate bond for the floating rate plus 25 basis points. This is illustrated in Figure 25.2. On coupon payment dates the payer 25.7 TOTAL RETURN SWAPS
M25_HULL0654_11_GE_C25.indd   597 30/04/2021   17:42598 CHAPTER 25
pays the coupons earned on an investment of $100 million in the bond. The receiver 
pays interest at the floating rate plus 25 basis points on a principal of $100 million. At the end of the life of the swap there is a payment reflecting the change in value of the bond. For example, if the bond increases in value by 10% over the life of the swap, the payer is required to pay $10 million (
= 10, of $100 million) at the end of the 5 years.  
Similarly, if the bond decreases in value by 15%, the receiver is required to pay  
$15 million at the end of the 5 years. If there is a default on the bond, the swap is  
usually terminated and the receiver makes a final payment equal to the excess of $100 million over the market value of the bond.
If the notional principal is added to both sides at the end of the life of the swap, the 
total return swap can be characterized as follows. The payer pays the cash flows on an investment of $100 million in the corporate bond. The receiver pays the cash flows on a  
$100 million bond paying the floating rate plus 25 basis points. If the payer owns the corporate bond, the total return swap allows it to pass the credit risk on the bond to the  
receiver. If it does not own the bond, the total return swap allows it to take a short position in the bond.
Total return swaps are often used as a financing tool. One scenario that could lead to  
the swap in Figure 25.2 is as follows. The receiver wants financing to invest $100  million  
in the reference bond. It approaches the payer (which is likely to be a financial  
institution) and agrees to the swap. The payer then invests $100 million in the bond.  
This leaves the receiver in the same position as it would have been if it had borrowed 
money at the floating rate plus 25 basis points to buy the bond. The payer retains  
ownership of the bond for the life of the swap and faces less credit risk than it would have done if it had lent money to the receiver to finance the purchase of the bond, with the bond being used as collateral for the loan. If the receiver defaults the payer does not  
have the legal problem of trying to realize on the collateral. Total return swaps are  
similar to repos (see Section 4.1) in that they are structured to minimize credit risk when  
securities are being financed.
The spread over the floating rate received by the payer is compensation for bearing 
the risk that the receiver will default. The payer will lose money if the receiver defaults at a time when the reference bond’s price has declined. The spread therefore depends on  
the credit quality of the receiver, the credit quality of the bond issuer, and the  
correlation between the two.
There are a number of variations on the standard deal we have described. Sometimes, 
instead of there being a cash payment for the change in value of the bond, there is  
physical settlement where the payer exchanges the underlying asset for the notional principal at the end of the life of the swap. Sometimes the change-in-value payments are  
made periodically rather than all at the end.Figure 25.2 Total return swap.

We discussed asset-backed securities (ABSs) in Chapter 8. Figure 8.1 shows a simple 
structure. An ABS where the underlying assets are bonds is known as a collateralized debt obligation, or CDO. A waterfall similar to that indicated in Figure 8.2 is defined for  
the interest and principal payments on the bonds. The precise rules underlying the waterfall are complicated, but they are designed to ensure that, if one tranche is more  
senior than another, it is more likely to receive promised interest payments and  
repayments of principal.
Synthetic CDOs
When a CDO is created from a bond portfolio, as just described, the resulting structure is  
known as a cash CDO. In an important market development, it was recognized that a  
long position in a corporate bond has a similar risk to a short position in a CDS when the  
reference entity in the CDS is the company issuing the bond. This led to an alternative structure known as a synthetic CDO.
The originator of a synthetic CDO chooses a portfolio of companies and a maturity 
(e.g., 5 years) for the structure. It sells CDS protection on each company in the portfolio with the CDS maturities equaling the maturity of the structure. The synthetic CDO principal is the total of the notional principals underlying the CDSs. The originator has  
cash inflows equal to the CDS spreads and cash outflows when companies in the  
portfolio default. Tranches are formed and the cash inflows and outflows are distributed to tranches. The rules for determining the cash inflows and outflows of tranches are more straightforward for a synthetic CDO than for a cash CDO. Suppose that there are  
only three tranches: equity, mezzanine, and senior. The rules might be as follows:
1. The equity tranche is responsible for the payouts on the CDSs until they reach 5% of the synthetic CDO principal. It earns a spread of 1,000 basis points per year on the outstanding tranche principal.
2. The mezzanine tranche is responsible for payouts in excess of 5% up to a  
maximum of 20% of the synthetic CDO principal. It earns a spread of 100 basis 
points per year on the outstanding tranche principal.
3. The senior tranche is responsible for payouts in excess of 20%. It earns a spread of  
10 basis points per year on the outstanding tranche principal.
To understand how the synthetic CDO would work, suppose that its principal is  
$100 million. The equity, mezzanine, and senior tranche principals are $5 million,  
$15 million, and $80 million, respectively. The tranches initially earn the specified 
spreads on these notional principals. Suppose that after 1 year defaults by companies in the portfolio lead to payouts of $2 million on the CDSs. The equity tranche holders are responsible for these payouts. The equity tranche principal reduces to $3 million and its spread (1,000 basis points) is then earned on $3 million instead of $5 million. If, later during the life of the CDO, there are further payouts of $4 million on the CDSs, the cumulative of the payments required by the equity tranche is $5 million, so that its  
outstanding principal becomes zero. The mezzanine tranche holders have to pay  
$1 million. This reduces their outstanding principal to $14 million.25.8 COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS
M25_HULL0654_11_GE_C25.indd   599 30/04/2021   17:42600 CHAPTER 25
Cash CDOs require an initial investment by the tranche holders (to finance the 
underlying bonds). By contrast, the holders of synthetic CDOs do not have to make  
an initial investment. They just have to agree to the way cash inflows and outflows will 
be calculated. In practice, they are almost invariably required to post the initial tranche principal as collateral. When the tranche becomes responsible for a payoff on a CDS, the money is taken out of the collateral. The balance in the collateral account usually earns interest.
Standard Portfolios and Single-Tranche Trading
In the synthetic CDO we have described, CDSs on individual companies were sold to create a portfolio of instruments equivalent to a portfolio of bonds. In a further market development, it was recognized that tranches can be traded without any underlying portfolio being created. An imaginary reference portfolio is used to define the cash flows on tranches. The buyer of protection pays the tranche spread to the seller of protection, and the seller of protection pays amounts to the buyer that correspond to those losses on the reference portfolio of CDSs that the tranche is responsible for. This is sometimes referred to as single-tranche trading because one tranche can be traded without there being any trading in other tranches.
In Section 25.3, we discussed CDS indices such as CDX NA IG and iTraxx Europe. 
The market has used the portfolios underlying these indices to define standard synthetic  
CDO tranches. These trade very actively. The six standard tranches of iTraxx Europe cover losses in the ranges 0–3%, 3–6%, 6–9%, 9–12%, 12–22%, and 22–100%. The six standard tranches of CDX NA IG cover losses in the ranges 0–3%, 3–7%, 7–10%, 10–15%, 15–30%, and 30–100%.
Table 25.6 shows the effect of the 2007–8 financial crisis on iTraxx Europe quotes. 
The index spread is the cost in basis points of buying protection on all the companies in  
the index, as described in Section 25.3. The quotes for all tranches except the 0–3% tranche is the cost in basis point per year of buying tranche protection. (As explained earlier, this is paid on a principal that declines as the tranche experiences losses.) In the case of the 0–3% (equity) tranche, the protection buyer makes an initial payment and then pays 500 basis points per year on the outstanding tranche principal. The quote is for the initial payment as a percentage of the initial tranche principal.
What a difference two years makes in the credit markets! Table 25.6 shows that the 
financial crisis led to a huge increase in credit spreads. The iTraxx index rose from  
Table 25.6  Mid-market quotes, from the Creditex Group, for 5-year tranches of 
iTraxx Europe. Quotes are in basis points except for the 0–3% tranche where the quote equals the percent of the tranche principal that must be paid up front in addition to 500 basis points per year.

23 basis points in January 2007 to 165 basis points in January 2009. The individual 
tranche quotes have also shown huge increases. One reason for the changes is that the  
default probabilities assessed by the market for investment-grade corporations increased.  
However, it is also the case that protection sellers were in many cases experiencing liquidity problems. They became more averse to risk and increased the risk premiums they required.
The cost of protection in a kth-to-default CDS or a tranche of a CDO is critically  
dependent on default correlation. Suppose that a basket of 100 reference entities is used 
to define a 5-year kth-to-default CDS and that each reference entity has a risk-neutral  
probability of 2% of defaulting during the 5 years. When the default correlation  
between the reference entities is zero the binomial distribution shows that the prob-ability of one or more defaults during the 5 years is 86.74% and the probability of 10 or more defaults is 0.0034%. A first-to-default CDS is therefore quite valuable whereas a tenth-to-default CDS is worth almost nothing.
As the default correlation increases the probability of one or more defaults declines 
and the probability of 10 or more defaults increases. In the limit where the default  correlation between the reference entities is perfect the probability of one or more 
defaults equals the probability of ten or more defaults and is 2%. This is because in this extreme situation the reference entities are essentially the same. Either they all default (with probability 2%) or none of them default (with probability 98%).
The valuation of a tranche of a CDO is similarly dependent on default correlation. If  
the correlation is low, the junior equity tranche is very risky and the senior tranches are  
very safe. As the default correlation increases, the junior tranches become less risky and  
the senior tranches become more risky. In the limit where the default correlation is perfect and the recovery rate is zero, the tranches are equally risky.25.9 ROLE OF CORRELATION IN A BASKET CDS AND CDO
Synthetic CDOs can be valued using the DerivaGem software. To explain the calcula-tions, suppose that the payment dates on a synthetic CDO tranche are at times 
t1, t2,c, tm and t0=0. Define Ej as the expected tranche principal at time tj and  
v1t2 as the present value of $1 received at time t. Suppose that the spread on a  
particular tranche (i.e., the number of basis points paid for protection) is s per year.  
This spread is paid on the remaining tranche principal. The present value of the  
expected regular spread payments on the CDO is therefore given by sA, where
 A=am
j=11tj-tj-12Ejv1tj2 (25. 1)
The expected loss between times tj-1 and tj is Ej-1-Ej. Assume that the loss occurs at  
the midpoint of the time interval (i.e., at time 0.5tj-1+0.5tj). The present value of the 25.10 VALUATION OF A SYNTHETIC CDO
M25_HULL0654_11_GE_C25.indd   601 30/04/2021   17:42602 CHAPTER 25
expected payoffs on the CDO tranche is
 C=am
j=11Ej-1-Ej2v10.5tj-1+0.5tj2 (25. 2)
The accrual payment due on the losses is given by sB, where 
B=am
j=10.51tj-tj-121Ej-1-Ej2v10.5tj-1+0.5tj2 (25. 3)
The value of the tranche to the protection buyer is C-sA-sB. The breakeven spread  
on the tranche occurs when the present value of the payments equals the present value 
of the payoffs or
C=sA+sB
The breakeven spread is therefore
 s=C
A+B (25. 4)
Equations (25.1) to (25.3) show the key role played by the expected tranche principal in  
calculating the breakeven spread for a tranche. If we know the expected principal for a  
tranche on all payment dates and we also know the zero-coupon yield curve, the 
breakeven tranche spread can be calculated from equation (25.4).
If there is an upfront payment and a fixed spread of s* (as is the case in Table 25.6 for  
the 0–3% tranche where s* is 500 basis points), the upfront payment as a percent of the 
principal is C-s*1A+B2.
Using the Gaussian Copula Model of Time to Default
The one-factor Gaussian copula model of time to default was introduced in Section 24.8.  
This is the standard market model for valuing synthetic CDOs. All companies are assumed to have the same probability 
Q1t2 of defaulting by time t. Equation (24.9) 
converts this unconditional probability of default by time t to the probability of default by time t conditional on the factor F:
 
Q1t∙F2=NaN-13Q1t24-2rF
21-rb (25. 5)
Here r is the copula correlation, assumed to be the same for any pair of companies.
In the calculation of Q1t2, it is usually assumed that the hazard rate for a company is 
constant and consistent with the index spread. The hazard rate that is assumed can be 
calculated by using the CDS valuation approach in Section 25.2 and searching for the hazard rate that gives the index spread. Suppose that this hazard rate is 
l. Then, from 
equation (24.1),
 Q1t2=1-e-lt (25. 6)
From the properties of the binomial distribution, the standard market model gives the  
probability of exactly k defaults by time t, conditional on F, as
 P1k, t∙F2=n!
1n-k2! k! Q1t∙F2k31-Q1t∙F24n-k (25. 7)
M25_HULL0654_11_GE_C25.indd   602 30/04/2021   17:42Credit Derivatives 603
where n is the number of reference entities in the portfolio. Suppose that the tranche 
under consideration covers losses on the portfolio between aL and aH. The parameter 
aL is known as the attachment point and the parameter aH is known as the detachment 
point. Define
nL=aLn
1-R and nH=aHn
1-R
where R is the recovery rate. Also, define m1x2 as the smallest integer greater than x. 
Without loss of generality, we assume that the initial tranche principal is 1. The tranche 
principal stays 1 while the number of defaults, k, is less than m1nL2. It is zero when the 
number of defaults is greater than or equal to m1nH2. Otherwise, the tranche principal is
aH-k11-R2>n
aH-aL
Define Ej1F2 as the expected tranche principal at time tj conditional on the value of the 
factor F. It follows that
 Ej1F2=am1nL2-1
k=0 P1k, tj∙F2+am1nH2-1
k=m1nL2 P1k, tj∙F2aH-k11-R2>n
aH-aL (25. 8)
Define A1F2, B1F2, and C1F2 as the values of A, B, and C conditional on F. Similarly to  
equations (25.1) to (25.3), 
A1F2=am
j=11tj-tj-12Ej1F2v1tj2 (25. 9)
 B1F2=am
j=10.51tj-tj-121Ej-11F2-Ej1F22v10.5tj-1+0.5tj2 (25. 10)
 C1F2=am
j=11Ej-11F2-Ej1F22v10.5tj-1+0.5tj2 (25. 11)
The variable F has a standard normal distribution. To calculate the unconditional  
values of A, B, and C, it is necessary to integrate A1F2, B1F2, and C1F2 over a standard   
normal distribution. Once the unconditional values have been calculated, the breakeven 
spread on the tranche can be calculated as C>1A+B2 or the upfront payment can be 
calculated as C-s*1A+B2.
The integration is best accomplished with a procedure known as Gaussian  quadrature. 
It involves the following approximation:

k=1wkg1Fk2 (25. 12)
As M increases, accuracy increases. The values of wk and Fk for different values of M 
are given on the author’s website.9 The value of M is twice the “number of integration 
9  The parameters wk and Fk are calculated from the roots of Hermite polynomials. For more information on 
Gaussian quadrature, see Technical Note 21 at www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull/TechnicalNotes.

points” variable in DerivaGem. Setting the number of integration points equal to 20 
usually gives good results.
Example 25.2
Consider the mezzanine tranche of iTraxx Europe (5-year maturity) when the  
copula correlation is 0.15 and the recovery rate is 40%. In this case, aL=0.03,
aH=0.06, n=125, nL=6.25, and nH=12.5. We suppose that the term structure  
of interest rates is flat at 3.5%, payments are made quarterly, and the CDS spread  
on the index is 50 basis points. A calculation similar to that in Section 25.2 shows 
that the constant hazard rate corresponding to the CDS spread is 0.83% (with  
continuous compounding). An extract from the remaining calculations is shown  
in Table 25.7. A value of M=60 is used in equation (25.12). The factor values, Fk,  
and their weights, wk, are shown in the first segment of the table. The expected

tranche principals on payment dates conditional on the factor values are calculated 
from equations (25.5) to (25.8) and shown in the second segment of the table. The values of A , B, and C  conditional on the factor values are calculated in the last three 
segments of the table using equations (25.9) to (25.11). The unconditional values of  
A, B, and C are calculated by integrating 
A1F2, B1F2, and C1F2 over the probability  
distribution of F. This is done by setting g1F2 equal in turn to A1F2, B1F2, and C1F2  
in equation (25.12). The result is
A=4.2846, B=0.0187, C=0.1496
The breakeven tranche spread is 0.1496>14.2846+0.01872=0.0348, or 348 basis 
points.
This result can be obtained from DerivaGem. The CDS worksheet is used to 
convert the 50-basis-point spread to a hazard rate of 0.83%. The CDO worksheet is then used with this hazard rate and 30 integration points.
Valuation of k th-to-Default CDS
A kth-to-default CDS (see Section 25.6) can also be valued using the standard market 
model by conditioning on the factor F. The conditional probability that the kth default happens between times 
tj-1 and tj is the conditional probability that there are k or  
more defaults by time tj minus the conditional probability that there are k or more 
defaults by time tj-1. This can be calculated from equations (25.5) to (25.7) as

Defaults between time tj-1 and tj can be assumed to happen at time 0.5tj-1+0.5tj. This 
allows the present value of payments and of payoffs, conditional on F, to be calculated in  
the same way as for regular CDS payoffs (see Section 25.2). By integrating over F, the unconditional present values of payments and payoffs can be calculated.
Example 25.3
Consider a portfolio consisting of 10 bonds each with a hazard rate of 2% per 
annum. Suppose we are interested in valuing a third-to-default CDS where pay-ments are made annually in arrears. Assume that the copula correlation is 0.3,  
the recovery rate is 40%, and all risk-free rates are 5%. As in Table 25.7, we  
consider 
M=60 different factor values. The unconditional cumulative probabil-
ity of each bond defaulting by years 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 is 0.0198, 0.0392, 0.0582, 0.0769, 0.0952, respectively. Equation (25.5) shows that, conditional on 
F=-1.0104, 
these default probabilities are 0.0361, 0.0746, 0.1122, 0.1484, 0.1830, respectively.  
From the binomial distribution, the conditional probability of three or more defaults by times 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years is 0.0047, 0.0335, 0.0928, 0.1757, 0.2717,  
respectively. The conditional probability of the third default happening during years 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 is therefore 0.0047, 0.0289, 0.0593, 0.0829, 0.0960, respectively.  
An analysis similar to that in Section 25.2 shows that the present values of  
payoffs, regular payments, and accrual payments conditional on 
F=-1.0104  
are 0.1379, 3.8443s, and 0.1149s, where s is the spread. Similar calculations are carried out for the other 59 factor values and equation (25.12) is used to integrate  
over F. The unconditional present values of payoffs, regular payments, and  
M25_HULL0654_11_GE_C25.indd   605 30/04/2021   17:42606 CHAPTER 25
accrual payments are 0.0629, 4.0580s, and 0.0524s. The breakeven CDS spread is 
therefore 0.0629>14.0580+0.05242=0.0153, or 153 basis points.

XImplied Correlation
In the standard market model, the recovery rate R is usually assumed to be 40%. This leaves the copula correlation 
r as the only unknown parameter. This makes the model 
similar to Black–Scholes–Merton, where there is only one unknown parameter, the volatility. Market participants like to imply a correlation from the market quotes for tranches in the same way that they imply a volatility from the market prices of options.
Suppose that the values of 
5aL, aH6 for successively more senior tranches are  
 5a0, a16, 5a1, a26, 5a2, a36,c, with a0=0. (For example, in the case of iTraxx Europe,  
a0=0, a1=0.03, a2=0.06, a3=0.09, a4=0.12, a5=0.22, a6=1.00.) There are 
two alternative implied correlation measures. One is compound correlation or tranche correlation. For a tranche 
5aq-1, aq6, this is the value of the correlation, r, that leads to  
the spread calculated from the model being the same as the spread in the market. It is found using an iterative search. The other is base correlation. For a particular value of  
aq 1qÚ12, this is the value of r that leads to the 50, aq6 tranche being priced 
 consistently with the market. It is obtained using the following steps:
1. Calculate the compound correlation for each tranche.
2. Use the compound correlation to calculate the present value of the expected loss 
on each tranche during the life of the CDO as a percent of the initial tranche  
principal. This is the variable we have defined as C above. Suppose that the value of C for the 
5aq-1, aq6 tranche is Cq.
3. Calculate the present value of the expected loss on the 50, aq6 tranche as a percent 
of the total principal of the underlying portfolio. This is aq
p=1 Cp1ap-ap-12.
M25_HULL0654_11_GE_C25.indd   606 30/04/2021   17:42Credit Derivatives 607
4. The C-value for the 50, aq6 tranche is the value calculated in Step 3 divided by aq. 
The base correlation is the value of the correlation parameter, r, that is consistent 
with this C-value. It is found using an iterative search.
The present value of the loss as a percent of underlying portfolio that would be  calculated  
in Step 3 for the iTraxx Europe quotes for January 31, 2007, given in Table 25.6 are  
shown in Figure 25.3. The implied correlations for these quotes are shown in Table 25.8. 
The calculations were carried out using DerivaGem assuming that the term structure of  
interest rates is flat at 3% and the recovery rate is 40%. The CDSs worksheet shows that 
the 23-basis-point spread implies a hazard rate of 0.382%. The implied correlations are calculated using the CDOs worksheet. The values underlying Figure 25.3 can also be calculated with this worksheet using the expression in Step 3 above.
The correlation patterns in Table 25.8 exhibit a “correlation smile”. As the tranche 
becomes more senior, the implied correlation first decreases and then increases. The base correlations exhibit a correlation skew where the implied correlation is an increas-ing function of the tranche detachment point.
If market prices were consistent with the one-factor Gaussian copula model, then the  
implied correlations (both compound and base) would be the same for all tranches. From the pronounced smiles and skews that are observed in practice, we can infer that market prices are not consistent with this model.
Valuing Nonstandard Tranches
We do not need a model to value the standard tranches of a standard portfolio such  
as iTraxx Europe because the spreads for these tranches can be observed in the  
market. Sometimes quotes need to be produced for nonstandard tranches of a  
standard portfolio. Suppose that you need a quote for the 4–8% iTraxx Europe  
tranche. One approach is to interpolate base correlations so as to estimate the base  
correlation for the 0–4% tranche and the 0–8% tranche. These two base correlations allow the present value of expected loss (as a percent of the underlying portfolio  
principal) to be estimated for these tranches. The present value of the expected loss for  
the 4–8% tranche (as a percent of the underlying principal) can be estimated as the  
difference between the present value of expected losses for the 0–8% and 0–4% tranches. This can be used to imply a compound correlation and a breakeven spread for the tranche.
It is now recognized that this is not the best way to proceed. A better approach is to 
calculate expected losses for each of the standard tranches and produce a chart such as  Table 25.8  Implied correlations for 5-year iTraxx Europe tranches on 
January 31, 2007.
Compound correlations
Tranche 0–3% 3–6% 6–9% 9–12% 12–22%
Implied correlation 17.7% 7.8% 14.0% 18.2% 23.3%
Base correlationsTranche 0–3% 0–6% 0–9% 0–12% 0–22%
Implied correlation 17.7% 28.4% 36.5% 43.2% 60.5%
M25_HULL0654_11_GE_C25.indd   607 30/04/2021   17:42608 CHAPTER 25
Figure 25.3 showing the variation of expected loss for the 0–X% tranche with X. Values  
on this chart can be interpolated to give the expected loss for the 0–4% and the 0–8%  
tranches. The difference between these expected losses is a better estimate of the  
expected loss on the 4–8% tranche than that obtained from the base correlation 
approach.
It can be shown that for no arbitrage the expected losses when calculated as in  
Figure 25.3 must increase with X at a decreasing rate. If base correlations are interpolated  
and then used to calculate expected losses, this no-arbitrage condition is often not  
satisfied. (The problem here is that the base correlation for the 0–X% tranche is a nonlinear function of the expected loss on the 0–X% tranche.) The direct approach of  
interpolating expected losses is therefore much better than the indirect approach of interpolating base correlations. What is more, it can be done so as to ensure that the no-arbitrage condition just mentioned is satisfied.

11 See J. C. Hull and A. White, “Valuation of a CDO and nth-to-Default Swap without Monte Carlo  
Simulation, ” Journal of Derivatives, 12, 2 (Winter 2004), 8–23.This section outlines a number of alternatives to the one-factor Gaussian copula model 
that has become the market standard.
Heterogeneous Model
The standard market model is a homogeneous model in the sense that the time-to- default probability distributions are assumed to be the same for all companies and the copula correlations for any pair of companies are the same. The homogeneity assump-tion can be relaxed so that a more general model is used. However, this model is more complicated to implement because each company has a different probability of default-ing by any given time and 
P1k, t∙F2 can no longer be calculated using the binomial 
formula in equation (25.7). It is necessary to use a numerical procedure such as that 
described in Andersen et al. (2003) and Hull and White (2004).10
Other Copulas
The one-factor Gaussian copula model is a particular model of the correlation between times to default. Many other one-factor copula models have been proposed. These include the Student t copula, the Clayton copula, Archimedean copula, and Marshall– Olkin copula. We can also create new one-factor copulas by assuming that F and the 
Zi 
in equation (24.7) have nonnormal distributions with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.  
Hull and White show that a good fit to the market is obtained when F and the Zi have 
Student t distributions with four degrees of freedom.11 They call this the double t copula.
Another approach is to increase the number of factors in the model. Unfortunately, 
the model is then much slower to run because it is necessary to integrate over several normal distributions instead of just one.25.11 ALTERNATIVES TO THE STANDARD MARKET MODEL
M25_HULL0654_11_GE_C25.indd   608 30/04/2021   17:42Credit Derivatives 609
Random Recovery and Factor Loadings
Andersen and Sidenius have suggested a model where the copula correlation r in  
equation (25.5) is a function of F and the recovery rate is negatively related to the default  
rate.12
In general, r increases as F decreases. This means that in states of the world where the  
default rate is high (i.e., states of the world where F is low) the default correlation is also  
high. There is empirical evidence suggesting that this is the case.13 Andersen and Sidenius  
find that this model fits market quotes much better than the standard market model.
The Implied Copula Model
Hull and White show how a copula can be implied from market quotes.14 The simplest 
version of the model assumes that a certain average hazard rate applies to all companies  
in a portfolio over the life of a CDO. That average hazard rate has a probability  
distribution that can be implied from the pricing of tranches. The calculation of the 
implied copula is similar in concept to the idea, discussed in Chapter 20, of calculating an implied probability distribution for a stock price from option prices.
Dynamic Models
The models discussed so far can be characterized as static models. In essence they  
model the average default environment over the life of the CDO. The model con-structed for a 5-year CDO is different from the model constructed for a 7-year CDO, which is in turn different from the model constructed for a 10-year CDO. Dynamic models are different from static models in that they attempt to model the evolution of  
the loss on a portfolio through time. There are three different types of dynamic  
models:
1. Structural Models: These are similar to the models described in Section 24.6  
except that the stochastic processes for the asset prices of many companies are modeled simultaneously. When the asset price for a company reaches a barrier, there is a default. The processes followed by the assets are correlated. The problem  
with these types of models is that they have to be implemented with Monte Carlo simulation and calibration is therefore difficult.
2. Reduced Form Models: In these models the hazard rates of companies are modeled.  
In order to build in a realistic amount of correlation, it is necessary to assume that 
there are jumps in the hazard rates.

3. Top Down Models: These are models where the total loss on a portfolio is modeled 
directly. The models do not consider what happens to individual companies.
SUMMARY
Credit derivatives enable banks and other financial institutions to actively manage their credit risks. They can be used to transfer credit risk from one company to another and to diversify credit risk by swapping one type of exposure for another.
The most common credit derivative is a credit default swap. This is a contract where 
one company buys insurance from another company against a third company (the  
reference entity) defaulting on its obligations. The payoff is designed to equal the  
difference between the face value of a bond issued by the reference entity and its value immediately after a default. Credit default swaps can be analyzed by calculating the present value of the expected payments and the present value of the expected payoff in a  
risk-neutral world.
A forward credit default swap is an obligation to enter into a particular credit default 
swap on a particular date. A credit default swap option is the right to enter into a  
particular credit default swap on a particular date. Both instruments cease to exist if the reference entity defaults before the date. A kth-to-default CDS is defined as a CDS that pays off when the kth default occurs in a portfolio of companies.
A total return swap is an instrument where the total return on a portfolio of credit- 
sensitive assets is exchanged for a floating rate plus a spread. Total return swaps are often used as financing vehicles. A company wanting to purchase a portfolio of assets will approach a financial institution to buy the assets on its behalf. The financial institution then enters into a total return swap with the company where it pays the return on the assets to the company and receives a floating rate plus a spread. The advantage of this type of arrangement is that the financial institution has less exposure than if it had lent the company money to buy the portfolio.
In a collateralized debt obligation a number of different securities are created from a  
portfolio of corporate bonds or commercial loans. There are rules for determining how credit losses are allocated. The result of the rules is that securities with both very high and  
very low credit ratings are created from the portfolio. In a synthetic collateralized debt obligation, cash flows on tranches are defined from a reference portfolio of credit default swaps. The standard market model for pricing both a kth-to-default CDS and tranches 
of a synthetic CDO is the one-factor Gaussian copula model for time to default.

Practice Questions
 25.1. Explain the difference between a regular credit default swap and a binary credit default 
swap.
 25.2. A 5-year credit default swap requires a quarterly payment at the rate of 60 basis points per year. The principal is $300 million and the credit default swap is settled in cash.  
A default occurs after 4 years and 2 months, and the price of the cheapest deliverable bond is estimated as 40% of its face value shortly after the default. List the cash flows  
and their timing for the seller of the credit default swap.
 25.3. Explain the difference between a cash CDO and a synthetic CDO.
 25.4. Explain the term “single-tranche trading.”

 25.7. Explain why a total return swap can be useful as a financing tool.
 25.8. Suppose that the risk-free zero curve is flat at 7% per annum with continuous

 25.10. What is the credit default swap spread in Problem 25.8 if it is a binary CDS?
 25.11. How does a 5-year nth-to-default credit default swap work? Consider a basket of 100 
reference entities where each reference entity has a probability of defaulting in each year of 1%. As the default correlation between the reference entities increases what would you expect to happen to the value of the swap when (a) 
n=1 and (b) n=25. Explain 
your answer.
 25.12. What is the formula relating the payoff on a CDS to the notional principal and the 
 recovery rate?

 25.14. Verify that, if the CDS spread for the example in Tables 25.1 to 25.4 is 100 basis points,  
the hazard rate must be 1.63% per year. How does the hazard rate change when the 
recovery rate is 20% instead of 40%? Verify that your answer is consistent with the implied hazard rate being approximately proportional to 
1>11-R2, where R is the 
recovery rate.
 25.15. A company enters into a total return swap where it receives the return on a corporate 
bond paying a coupon of 5% and pays a floating rate. Explain the difference between this and a regular swap where 5% is exchanged for a floating rate.
 25.16. Explain how forward contracts and options on credit default swaps are structured.
 25.17. “The position of a buyer of a credit default swap is similar to the position of someone 
who is long a risk-free bond and short a corporate bond.” Explain this statement.
 25.18. Why is there a potential asymmetric information problem in credit default swaps?
 25.19. Does valuing a CDS using real-world default probabilities rather than risk-neutral 
default probabilities overstate or understate its value? Explain your answer.
 25.20. What is the difference between a total return swap and an asset swap?
 25.21. Suppose that in a one-factor Gaussian copula model the 5-year probability of default for 
each of 125 names is 3% and the pairwise copula correlation is 0.2. Calculate, for factor values of 
-2, -1, 0, 1, and 2: (a) the default probability conditional on the factor value 
and (b) the probability of more than 10 defaults conditional on the factor value.
 25.22. Explain the difference between base correlation and compound correlation.
 25.23. In Example 25.2, what is the tranche spread for the 9% to 12% tranche assuming a 
tranche correlation of 0.15?
 25.24. Suppose that the risk-free zero curve is flat at 6% per annum with continuous  
compounding and that defaults can occur at times 0.25 years, 0.75 years, 1.25 years,  
and 1.75 years in a 2-year plain vanilla credit default swap with semiannual payments. 
Suppose that the recovery rate is 20% and the unconditional probabilities of default (as  
seen at time zero) are 1% at times 0.25 years and 0.75 years, and 1.5% at times 1.25  
years and 1.75 years. What is the credit default swap spread? What would the credit default spread be if the instrument were a binary credit default swap?
 25.25. Assume that the hazard rate for a company is 
l and the recovery rate is R. The risk-free 
interest rate is 5% per annum. Default always occurs halfway through a year. The spread 
for a 5-year plain vanilla CDS where payments are made annually is 120 basis points and  
the spread for a 5-year binary CDS where payments are made annually is 160 basis points. Estimate R and 
l.
 25.26. Explain how you would expect the returns offered on the various tranches in a synthetic 
CDO to change when the correlation between the bonds in the portfolio increases.
 25.27. Suppose that:
(a) The yield on a 5-year risk-free bond is 7%.
(b) The yield on a 5-year corporate bond issued by company X is 9.5%.
(c) A 5-year credit default swap providing insurance against company X defaulting  
costs 150 basis points per year.
  What arbitrage opportunity is there in this situation? What arbitrage opportunity would  
there be if the credit default spread were 300 basis points instead of 150 basis points?
M25_HULL0654_11_GE_C25.indd   612 30/04/2021   17:42Credit Derivatives 613
 25.28. In Example 25.3, what is the spread for (a) a first-to-default CDS and (b) a second-to- 
default CDS?
 25.29. In Example 25.2, what is the tranche spread for the 6% to 9% tranche assuming a  
tranche correlation of 0.15?
 25.30. Table 25.6 shows the 5-year iTraxx index was 77 basis points on January 31, 2008.  
Assume the risk-free rate is 5% for all maturities, the recovery rate is 40%, and  
payments are quarterly. Assume also that the spread of 77 basis points applies to all 
maturities. Use the DerivaGem CDS worksheet to calculate a hazard rate consistent with the spread. Use this in the CDO worksheet with 10 integration points to imply base correlations for each tranche from the quotes for January 31, 2008.

Exotic Options
Derivatives such as European and American call and put options are what are termed 
plain vanilla products. They have standard well-defined properties and trade actively. Their prices or implied volatilities are quoted by exchanges or by interdealer brokers  
on a regular basis. One of the exciting aspects of the over-the-counter derivatives  
market is the number of nonstandard products that have been created by financial engineers. These products are termed exotic options, or simply exotics. Although they usually constitute a relatively small part of its portfolio, exotics are important to a derivatives dealer because they are generally much more profitable than plain vanilla products.
Exotic products are developed for a number of reasons. Sometimes they meet a 
genuine hedging need in the market; sometimes there are tax, accounting, legal, or regulatory reasons why corporate treasurers, fund managers, and financial institutions find exotic products attractive; sometimes the products are designed to reflect a view on  
potential future movements in particular market variables; occasionally an exotic  
product is designed by a derivatives dealer to appear more attractive than it is to an unwary corporate treasurer or fund manager.
In this chapter, we describe some of the more commonly occurring exotic options 
and discuss their valuation. We assume that the underlying asset provides a yield at rate  
q. As discussed in Chapters 17 and 18, for an option on a stock index q should be set equal to the dividend yield on the index, for an option on a currency it should be set equal to the foreign risk-free rate, and for an option on a futures contract it should be set equal to the domestic risk-free rate. Many of the options discussed in this chapter can be valued using the DerivaGem software.26 CHAPTER  
26.1 PACKAGES
A package is a portfolio consisting of standard European calls, standard European 
puts, forward contracts, cash, and the underlying asset itself. We discussed a number of different types of packages in Chapter 12: bull spreads, bear spreads, butterfly spreads, calendar spreads, straddles, strangles, and so on.
M26_HULL0654_11_GE_C26.indd   614 12/05/2021   18:19Exotic Options 615
Often a package is structured by traders so that it has zero cost initially. An example 
is a range forward contract.1 This was discussed in Section 17.2. It consists of a long call 
and a short put or a short call and a long put. The call strike price is greater than the 
put strike price and the strike prices are chosen so that the value of the call equals the value of the put.
It is worth noting that any derivative can be converted into a zero-cost product by 
deferring payment until maturity. Consider a European call option. If c is the cost of  
the option when payment is made at time zero, then 
A=cerT is the cost when payment 
is made at time T, the maturity of the option. The payoff is then max1ST-K, 02-A or  
max1ST-K-A, -A2. When the strike price, K , equals the forward price, other names  
for a deferred payment option are break forward, Boston option, forward with optional exit, and cancelable forward.
1  Other names used for a range forward contract are zero-cost collar, flexible forward, cylinder option, option 
fence, min–max, and forward band.26.2 PERPETUAL AMERICAN CALL AND PUT OPTIONS
The differential equation that must be satisfied by the price of a derivative when there is  
a dividend at rate q is equation (17.6):
0f
0t+1r-q2S0f
0S+1
2s2S2 02f
0S2=rf
Consider a derivative that pays off a fixed amount Q when S=H for the first time. If  
S6H, the boundary conditions for the differential equation are that f=Q when 
S=H and f=0 when S=0. The solution f=Q1S>H2a satisfies the boundary  
conditions when a70. Furthermore, it satisfies the differential equation when
1r-q2a+1
2a1a-12s2=r
The positive solution to this equation is a=a1, where
a1=-w+2w2+2s2r
s2
and w=r-q-s2>2. It follows that the value of the derivative must be Q1S>H2a1 
because this satisfies the boundary conditions and the differential equation.
Consider next a perpetual American call option with strike price K. If the option is 
exercised when S=H, the payoff is H-K and from the result just proved the value of  
the option is 1H-K21S>H2a1. The holder of the call option can choose the asset price, 
H, at which the option is exercised. The optimal H is the one that maximizes the value we have just calculated. Using standard calculus methods, it is 
H=H1, where
H1=K a1

If S7H1, the call should be exercised immediately and is worth S-K.
To value an American put, we consider a derivative that pays off Q when S=H in 
the situation where S7H (so that the barrier H is reached from above). In this case, 
the boundary conditions for the differential equation are that f=Q when S=H and  
f=0 as S tends to infinity. In this case, the solution f=Q1S>H2-a satisfies the  
boundary conditions when a70. As above, we can show that it also satisfies the  
differential equation when a=a2, where
a2=w+2w2+2s2r
s2
If the holder of the American put chooses to exercise when S=H, the value of the put  
is 1K-H21S>H2-a2. The holder of the put will choose the exercise level H=H2 to 
maximize this. This is
H2=K a2

The price of a perpetual put if S7H2 is therefore

If S6H2, the put should be exercised immediately and is worth K-S.
Section 15.6 and Problem 15.21 give particular cases of the results here for q=0.
26.3 NONSTANDARD AMERICAN OPTIONS
In a standard American option, exercise can take place at any time during the life of the 
option and the exercise price is always the same. The American options that are traded in the over-the-counter market sometimes have nonstandard features. For example:
1. Early exercise may be restricted to certain dates. The instrument is then known as a Bermudan option. (Bermuda is between Europe and America!)
2. Early exercise may be allowed during only part of the life of the option. For  
example, there may be an initial “lock out” period with no early exercise.
3. The strike price may change during the life of the option.
The warrants issued by corporations on their own stock often have some or all of these features. For example, in a 7-year warrant, exercise might be possible on particular dates  
during years 3 to 7, with the strike price being $30 during years 3 and 4, $32 during the next 2 years, and $33 during the final year.
Nonstandard American options can usually be valued using a binomial tree. At each 
node, the test (if any) for early exercise is adjusted to reflect the terms of the option.

26.4 GAP OPTIONS
A gap call option is a European call options that pays off ST-K1 when ST7K2. The 
difference between a gap call option and a regular call option with a strike price of K2 is  
that the payoff when ST7K2 is increased by K2-K1. (This increase is positive or 
negative depending on whether K27K1 or K17K2.)
A gap call option can be valued by a small modification to the Black–Scholes– 
Merton formula. With our usual notation, the value is
 S0e-qT N1d12-K1e-rTN1d22 (26.1)
where
d1=ln1S0>K22+1r-q+s2>22T
s2T
d2=d1-s2T
The price in this formula is greater than the price given by the Black–Scholes–Merton 
formula for a regular call option with strike price K2 by
1K2-K12e-rTN1d22
To understand this difference, note that the probability that the option will be exercised is 
N1d22 and, when it is exercised, the payoff to the holder of the gap option is greater 
than that to the holder of the regular option by K2-K1.
For a gap put option, the payoff is K1-ST when ST6K2. The value of the option is
 K1e-rTN1-d22-S0e-qTN1-d12 (26.2)
where d1 and d2 are defined as for equation (26.1).
Example 26.1
An asset is currently worth $500,000. Over the next year, its price is expected to  
have a volatility of 20%. The risk-free rate is 5%, and no income is expected.  
Suppose that an insurance company agrees to buy the asset for $400,000 if its value has fallen below $400,000 at the end of one year. The payout will be 
400,000-ST 
whenever the value of the asset is less than $400,000. The insurance company has  
provided a regular put option where the policyholder has the right to sell the asset  
to the insurance company for $400,000 in one year. This can be valued using equation (15.21), with 
S0=500,000, K=400,000, r=0.05, s=0.2, T=1. The 
value is $3,436.
Suppose next that the cost of transferring the asset is $50,000 and this cost is  
borne by the policyholder. The option is then exercised only if the value of the asset is less than $350,000. In this case, the cost to the insurance company is 
K1-ST when ST6K2, where K2=350,000, K1=400,000, and ST is the price  
of the asset in one year. This is a gap put option. The value is given by equa-tion ( 26.2), with 
S0=500,000, K1=400,000, K2=350,000, r=0.05, q=0, 
s=0.2, T=1. It is $1,896. Recognizing the costs to the policyholder of making 
a claim reduces the cost of the policy to the insurance company by about 45% in this case.
M26_HULL0654_11_GE_C26.indd   617 12/05/2021   18:19618 CHAPTER 26
Forward start options are options that will start at some time in the future. Sometimes 
employee stock options, which were discussed in Chapter 16, can be viewed as forward start options. This is because the company commits (implicitly or explicitly) to granting at-the-money options to employees in the future.
Consider a forward start at-the-money European call option that will start at time 
T1 
and mature at time T2. Suppose that the asset price is S0 at time zero and S1 at time T1. 
To value the option, we note from the European option pricing formulas in Chapters 15  
and 17 that the value of an at-the-money call option on an asset is proportional to the asset price. The value of the forward start option at time 
T1 is therefore cS1>S0, where c  
is the value at time zero of an at-the-money option that lasts for T2-T1. Using risk- 
neutral valuation, the value of the forward start option at time zero is
e-rT1Encc S1
S0d
where En denotes the expected value in a risk-neutral world. Since c and S0 are known and 
En3S14=S0e1r-q2T1, the value of the forward start option is ce-qT1. For a non-dividend- 
paying stock, q=0 and the value of the forward start option is exactly the same as the 
value of a regular at-the-money option with the same life as the forward start option.26.5 FORWARD START OPTIONS
26.6 CLIQUET OPTIONS
A cliquet option (which is also called a ratchet or strike reset option) is a series of call or put options with rules for determining the strike price. Suppose that the reset dates are  
at times 
t1, t2, c, tn-1 with tn being the end of the cliquet’s life. A simple structure 
would be as follows. The first option has a strike price K equal to the initial asset price and lasts between times 0 and 
t1; the second option provides a payoff at time t2 with a 
strike price equal to the value of the asset at time t1; the third option provides a payoff 
at time t3 with a strike price equal to the value of the asset at time t2; and so on. This is 
a regular option plus n-1 forward start options. The latter can be valued as described 
in Section 26.5.
Some cliquet options are much more complicated than the one described here. For 
example, sometimes there are upper and lower limits on the total payoff over the whole period; sometimes cliquets terminate at the end of a period if the asset price is in a certain range. When analytic results are not available, Monte Carlo simulation is often the best approach for valuation.
26.7 COMPOUND OPTIONS
Compound options are options on options. There are four main types of compound options: a call on a call, a put on a call, a call on a put, and a put on a put. Compound options have two strike prices and two exercise dates. Consider, for example, a call on a call. On the first exercise date, 
T1, the holder of the compound option is entitled to pay 
the first strike price, K1, and receive a call option. The call option gives the holder the 
M26_HULL0654_11_GE_C26.indd   618 12/05/2021   18:19Exotic Options 619
right to buy the underlying asset for the second strike price, K2, on the second exercise 
date, T2. The compound option will be exercised on the first exercise date only if the 
value of the option on that date is greater than the first strike price.
When the usual geometric Brownian motion assumption is made, European-style 
compound options can be valued analytically in terms of integrals of the bivariate  
normal distribution.2 With our usual notation, the value at time zero of a European call 
option on a call option is
S0e-qT2M1a1, b1; 2T1>T22-K2e-rT2M1a2, b2; 2T1>T22-e-rT1K1N1a22
where
a1=ln1S0>S*2+1r-q+s2>22T1
s2T1, a2=a1-s2T1
b1=ln1S0>K22+1r-q+s2>22T2
s2T2, b2=b1-s2T2
The function M1a, b:r2 is the cumulative bivariate normal distribution function that the  
first variable will be less than a and the second will be less than b when the coefficient 
of correlation between the two is r.3 The variable S* is the asset price at time T1 for 
which the option price at time T1 equals K1. If the actual asset price is above S* at time 
T1, the first option will be exercised; if it is not above S*, the option expires worthless.
With similar notation, the value of a European put on a call is
K2e-rT2M1-a2, b2; -2T1>T22-S0e-qT2M1-a1, b1; -2T1>T22+e-rT1K1N1-a22
The value of a European call on a put is
K2e-rT2M1-a2, -b2; 2T1>T22-S0e-qT2 M1-a1, -b1; 2T1>T22 - e-rT1 K1 N1-a22
The value of a European put on a put is
S0e-qT2 M1a1, -b1; -2T1>T22-K2e-rT2 M1a2, -b2; -2T1>T22+e-rT1K1N1a22
3  See Technical Note 5 at www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull/TechnicalNotes for a numerical procedure for 
calculating M. A function for calculating M is also on the website.2  See R. Geske, “The Valuation of Compound Options,” Journal of Financial Economics, 7 (1979): 63–81;  
M. Rubinstein, “Double Trouble,” Risk, December 1991/January 1992: 53–56.26.8 CHOOSER OPTIONS
A chooser option (sometimes referred to as an as you like it option) has the feature that,  
after a specified period of time, the holder can choose whether the option is a call or a  
put. Suppose that the time when the choice is made is T1. The value of the chooser 
option at this time is
max1c,  p2
where c is the value of the call underlying the option and p is the value of the put 
underlying the option.
If the options underlying the chooser option are both European and have the same 
strike price, put–call parity can be used to provide a valuation formula. Suppose that S1 
M26_HULL0654_11_GE_C26.indd   619 12/05/2021   18:19620 CHAPTER 26
is the asset price at time T1, K is the strike price, T2 is the maturity of the options, and r  
is the risk-free interest rate. Put–call parity implies that
 max1c,  p2=max1c,  c+Ke-r1T2-T12-S1e-q1T2-T122
 =c+e-q1T2-T12 max10, Ke-1r-q21T2-T12-S12
This shows that the chooser option is a package consisting of:
1. A call option with strike price K and maturity T2
2. e-q1T2-T12 put options with strike price Ke-1r-q21T2-T12 and maturity T1
As such, it can readily be valued.
More complex chooser options can be defined where the call and the put do not have  
the same strike price and time to maturity. They are then not packages and have  
features that are somewhat similar to compound options.
26.9 BARRIER OPTIONS
Barrier options are options where the payoff depends on whether the underlying asset’s 
price reaches a certain level during a certain period of time.
A number of different types of barrier options regularly trade in the over-the-counter 
market. They are attractive to some market participants because they are less expensive  
than the corresponding regular options. These barrier options can be classified as either knock-out options or knock-in options. A knock-out option ceases to exist when the underlying asset price reaches a certain barrier; a knock-in option comes into existence only when the underlying asset price reaches a barrier.
Equations (17.4) and (17.5) show that the values at time zero of a regular call and put  
option are
 c=S0e-qTN1d12-Ke-rTN1d22
 p=Ke-rTN1-d22-S0e-qTN1-d12
where
d1=ln1S0>K2+1r-q+s2>22T
s2T
d2=ln1S0>K2+1r-q-s2>22T
s2T=d1-s2T
A down-and-out call is one type of knock-out option. It is a regular call option that 
ceases to exist if the asset price reaches a certain barrier level H. The barrier level is below the initial asset price. The corresponding knock-in option is a down-and-in call. This is a regular call that comes into existence only if the asset price reaches the barrier level.
If H is less than or equal to the strike price, K, the value of a down-and-in call at time  
zero is
cdi=S0e-qT1H>S022lN1y2-Ke-rT1H>S022l-2N1y-s2T2
M26_HULL0654_11_GE_C26.indd   620 12/05/2021   18:19Exotic Options 621
where
 l=r-q+s2>2
s2
 y=ln3H2>1S0K24
s2T+ls2T
Because the value of a regular call equals the value of a down-and-in call plus the value 
of a down-and-out call, the value of a down-and-out call is given by
cdo=c-cdi
If HÚK, then
cdo=S0N1x12e-qT-Ke-rTN1x1-s2T2
- S0e-qT1H>S022lN1y12+Ke-rT1H>S022l-2N1y1-s2T2
and
cdi=c-cdo
where
x1=ln1S0>H2
s2T+ls2T, y1=ln1H>S02
s2T+ls2T
An up-and-out call is a regular call option that ceases to exist if the asset price reaches a 
barrier level, H, that is higher than the current asset price. An up-and-in call is a regular call option that comes into existence only if the barrier is reached. When H is less than or equal to K, the value of the up-and-out call, 
cuo, is zero and the value of the up-and- 
in call, cui, is c. When H is greater than K,
cui=S0N1x12e-qT-Ke-rTN1x1-s2T2-S0e-qT1H>S022l3N1-y2-N1-y124
+Ke-rT1H>S022l-23N1-y+s2T2-N1-y1+s2T24
and
cuo=c-cui
Put barrier options are defined similarly to call barrier options. An up-and-out put is a  
put option that ceases to exist when a barrier, H , that is greater than the current asset 
price is reached. An up-and-in put is a put that comes into existence only if the barrier  
is reached. When the barrier, H, is greater than or equal to the strike price, K, their  
prices are
pui=-S0e-qT1H>S022lN1-y2+Ke-rT1H>S022l-2N1-y+s2T2
and
puo=p-pui
When H is less than or equal to K,
puo=-S0N1-x12e-qT+Ke-rT N1-x1+s2T2
+S0e-qT1H>S022lN1-y12-Ke-rT1H>S022l-2 N1-y1+s2T2
and
pui=p-puo
A down-and-out put is a put option that ceases to exist when a barrier less than the 
current asset price is reached. A down-and-in put is a put option that comes into  
M26_HULL0654_11_GE_C26.indd   621 12/05/2021   18:19622 CHAPTER 26
existence only when the barrier is reached. When the barrier is greater than the strike 
price, pdo=0 and pdi=p. When the barrier is less than the strike price,
pdi=-S0N1-x12e-qT+Ke-rTN1-x1+s2T2+S0e-qT1H>S022l3N1y2-N1y124
- Ke-rT1H>S022l-2 3N1y-s2T2-N1y1-s2T24
and
pdo=p-pdi
All of these valuations make the usual assumption that the probability distribution for the asset price at a future time is lognormal. An important issue for barrier options is the  
frequency with which the asset price, S, is observed for purposes of determining whether the barrier has been reached. The analytic formulas given in this section assume that S is  
observed continuously and sometimes this is the case.
4 Often, the terms of a contract  
state that S is observed periodically; for example, once a day at 3 p.m. Broadie, Glasser-man, and Kou provide a way of adjusting the formulas we have just given for the  
situation where the price of the underlying is observed discretely.
5 The barrier level H is 
replaced by He0.5826s2T>m for an up-and-in or up-and-out option and by He-0.5826s2T>m 
for a down-and-in or down-and-out option, where m is the number of times the asset price is observed (so that 
T>m is the time interval between observations).
Barrier options often have quite different properties from regular options. For 
example, sometimes vega is negative. Consider an up-and-out call option when the asset price is close to the barrier level. As volatility increases, the probability that the barrier will be hit increases. As a result, a volatility increase can cause the price of the barrier option to decrease in these circumstances.
One disadvantage of the barrier options we have considered so far is that a “spike” in  
the asset price can cause the option to be knocked in or out. An alternative structure is  
a Parisian option, where the asset price has to be above or below the barrier for a period 
of time for the option to be knocked in or out. For example, a down-and-out Parisian put option with a strike price equal to 90% of the initial asset price and a barrier at 75% of the initial asset price might specify that the option is knocked out if the asset price is below the barrier for 50 days. The confirmation might specify that the 50 days are a “continuous period of 50 days” or “any 50 days during the option’s life.” Parisian options are more difficult to value than regular barrier options.
6 Monte Carlo simula-
tion and binomial trees can be used with the enhancements discussed in Sections 27.5 
and 27.6.
4  One way to track whether a barrier has been reached from below (above) is to send a limit order to the 
exchange to sell (buy) the asset at the barrier price and see whether the order is filled.

6    See, for example, M. Chesney, J. Cornwall, M. Jeanblanc-Picqué, G. Kentwell, and M. Yor, “Parisian 
pricing,” Risk, 10, 1 (1997), 77–79.26.10 BINARY OPTIONS
Binary or digital options are options with discontinuous payoffs. A simple example of a  
binary option is a cash-or-nothing call. This pays off nothing if the asset price ends up 
M26_HULL0654_11_GE_C26.indd   622 12/05/2021   18:19Exotic Options 623
below the strike price at time T and pays a fixed amount, Q, if it ends up above the  
strike price. In a risk-neutral world, the probability of the asset price being above the 
strike price at the maturity of an option is, with our usual notation, N1d22. The value of  
a cash-or-nothing call is therefore Qe-rTN1d22. A cash-or-nothing put is defined  
analogously to a cash-or-nothing call. It pays off Q if the asset price is below the strike price and nothing if it is above the strike price. The value of a cash-or-nothing  
put is 
Qe-rTN1-d22.
Another type of binary option is an asset-or-nothing call. This pays off nothing if the 
underlying asset price ends up below the strike price and pays the asset price if it ends up above the strike price. With our usual notation, the value of an asset-or-nothing call is 
S0e-qTN1d12. An asset-or-nothing put pays off nothing if the underlying asset price 
ends up above the strike price and the asset price if it ends up below the strike price. The  
value of an asset-or-nothing put is S0e-qTN1-d12.
Binary options have discontinuous payoffs. This can create problems if the under-
lying asset is thinly traded so that relatively small buy or sell trades move the price.  
Consider a cash-or-nothing call with a strike price of $20 and a payoff of $1 million. If  
the final asset price is $19.99, there is no payoff; if it is $20 or more, the payoff is  
$1 million. If there is one day left in the life of the option and the price a little below $20, it would be tempting for the holder of the cash-or-nothing call to place buy orders for the underlying asset to tip the price over $20. A similar issue can arise with barrier  
options on thinly traded assets. If the price of the underlying asset is close to the  
barrier, one side is likely to be tempted to place buy or sell orders to ensure that the barrier is reached.
A regular European call option is equivalent to a long position in an asset-or-nothing  
call and a short position in a cash-or-nothing call where the cash payoff in the cash-or- nothing call equals the strike price. Similarly, a regular European put option is equivalent to a long position in a cash-or-nothing put and a short position in an  
asset-or-nothing put where the cash payoff on the cash-or-nothing put equals the strike price.

Journal of Finance, 34 (December 1979): 1111–27.; M. Garman, “Recollection in Tranquility,” Risk, March 
(1989): 16–19.26.11 LOOKBACK OPTIONS
The payoffs from lookback options depend on the maximum or minimum asset price reached during the life of the option. The payoff from a floating lookback call is the amount that the final asset price exceeds the minimum asset price achieved during the  
life of the option. The payoff from a floating lookback put is the amount by which the maximum asset price achieved during the life of the option exceeds the final asset  
price.
Valuation formulas have been produced for floating lookbacks.

floating lookback call at time zero is

s2
and Smin is the minimum asset price achieved to date. (If the lookback has just been 
originated, Smin=S0.) See Problem 26.23 for the r=q case.
The value of a floating lookback put is
pfl=Smaxe-rT cN1b12-s2
21r-q2 eY2N1-b32d+S0e-qT s2

 Y2=21r-q-s2>22ln1Smax>S02
s2
and Smax is the maximum asset price achieved to date. (If the lookback has just been 
originated, then Smax=S0.)
A floating lookback call is a way that the holder can buy the underlying asset at the 
lowest price achieved during the life of the option. Similarly, a floating lookback put is a  
way that the holder can sell the underlying asset at the highest price achieved during the  
life of the option.
Example 26.2
Consider a newly issued floating lookback put on a non-dividend-paying stock 
where the stock price is 50, the stock price volatility is 40% per annum, the risk-free rate is 10% per annum, and the time to maturity is 3 months. In this case, 
Smax=50, S0=50, r=0.1, q=0, s=0.4, and T=0.25, b1=-0.025, 
b2=-0.225, b3=0.025, and Y2=0, so that the value of the lookback put  
is 7.79. A newly issued floating lookback call on the same stock is worth 8.04.
In a fixed lookback option, a strike price is specified. For a fixed lookback call option, the payoff is the same as a regular European call option except that the final asset price is replaced by the maximum asset price achieved during the life of the option. For a fixed lookback put option, the payoff is the same as a regular European put option except that the the final asset price is replaced by the minimum asset price achieved during the life of the option. Define 
S*
max=max1Smax, K2, where as before Smax is the 
maximum asset price achieved to date and K is the strike price. Also, define p*

value of a floating lookback put which lasts for the same period as the fixed lookback 
call when the actual maximum asset price so far, Smax, is replaced by S*
max. A put–call 
parity type of argument shows that the value of the fixed lookback call option, cfix is 
given by8
cfix=p*
fl+S0e-qT-Ke-rT
Similarly, if S*
min=min1Smin, K2, then the value of a fixed lookback put option, pfix, is 
given by
pfix=c*
fl+Ke-rT-S0e-qT
where c*
fl is the value of a floating lookback call that lasts for the same period as the 
fixed lookback put when the actual minimum asset price so far, Smin, is replaced by  
S*
min. This shows that the equations given above for floating lookbacks can be modified 
to price fixed lookbacks.
Lookbacks are appealing to investors, but very expensive when compared with  
regular options. As with barrier options, the value of a lookback option is liable to  
be sensitive to the frequency with which the asset price is observed for the purposes of computing the maximum or minimum. The formulas above assume that the asset price is observed continuously. Broadie, Glasserman, and Kou provide a way of adjusting the  
formulas we have just given for the situation where the asset price is observed  
discretely.

Options,” Finance and Stochastics, 2 (1998): 1–28.26.12 SHOUT OPTIONS
A shout option is a European option where the holder can “shout” to the writer at one 
time during its life. At the end of the life of the option, the option holder receives either the usual payoff from a European option or the intrinsic value at the time of the shout, whichever is greater. Suppose the strike price is $50 and the holder of a call shouts when  
the price of the underlying asset is $60. If the final asset price is less than $60, the holder receives a payoff of $10. If it is greater than $60, the holder receives the excess of the asset price over $50.
A shout option has some of the same features as a lookback option, but is  
considerably less expensive. It can be valued by noting that if the holder shouts at a time t when the asset price is 
St the payoff from the option is
max10, ST-St2+1St-K2
where, as usual, K is the strike price and ST is the asset price at time T. The value at 
time t if the holder shouts is therefore the present value of St-K (received at time T )  
plus the value of a European option with strike price St. The latter can be calculated 
using Black–Scholes–Merton formulas.
A shout option is valued by constructing a binomial or trinomial tree for the under-
lying asset in the usual way. Working back through the tree, the value of the option if the  
holder shouts and the value if the holder does not shout can be calculated at each node. 
M26_HULL0654_11_GE_C26.indd   625 12/05/2021   18:19626 CHAPTER 26
The option’s price at the node is the greater of the two. The procedure for valuing a shout  
option is therefore similar to the procedure for valuing a regular American option.
10  When the asset price follows geometric Brownian motion, the geometric average of the price is exactly 
lognormal and the arithmetic average is approximately lognormal.
11  See S. M. Turnbull and L. M. Wakeman, “A Quick Algorithm for Pricing European Average Options,” 
Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 26 (September 1991): 377–89.26.13 ASIAN OPTIONS
Asian options are options where the payoff depends on the arithmetic average of the 
price of the underlying asset during the life of the option. The payoff from an average price call is 
max10, Save-K2 and that from an average price put is max10, K-Save2, 
where Save is the average price of the underlying asset. Average price options tend to be  
less expensive than regular options and are arguably more appropriate than regular options for meeting some of the needs of corporate treasurers. Suppose that a U.S.  
corporate treasurer expects to receive a cash flow of 100 million Australian dollars spread evenly over the next year from the company’s Australian subsidiary. The  
treasurer is likely to be interested in an option that guarantees that the average exchange rate realized during the year is above some level. An average price put option can achieve this more effectively than regular put options.
Average price options can be valued using similar formulas to those used for regular 
options if it is assumed that 
Save is lognomal. As it happens, when the usual assumption 
is made for the process followed by the asset price, this is a reasonable assumption.10 
A popular approach is to fit a lognormal distribution to the first two moments of Save 
and use Black’s model.11 Suppose that M1 and M2 are the first two moments of Save. 
The value of average price calls and puts are given by equations (18.7) and (18.8), with
 F0=M1 (26.3)
and

Example 26.3
Consider a newly issued average price call option on a non-dividend-paying stock 
where the stock price is 50, the strike price is 50, the stock price volatility is 40% per annum, the risk-free rate is 10% per annum, and the time to maturity is 1 year. In this case, 
S0=50, K=50, r=0.1, q=0, s=0.4, and T=1. If the average is  
calculated continuously, M1=52.59 and M2=2,922.76. From equations (26.3) 
and (26.4), F0=52.59 and s=23.54%. Equation (18.7), with K=50, T=1, and 
r=0.1, gives the value of the option as 5.62. When 12, 52, and 250 observations 
are used for the average, the price is 6.00, 5.70, and 5.63, respectively.
We can modify the analysis to accommodate the situation where the option is not newly issued and some prices used to determine the average have already been observed. Suppose that the averaging period is composed of a period of length 
t1 over which 
prices have already been observed and a future period of length t2 (the remaining life of  
the option). Suppose that the average asset price during the first time period is S. The 
payoff from an average price call is
maxaSt1+Savet2
t1+t2-K, 0b
where Save is the average asset price during the remaining part of the averaging period. 
This is the same as
t2
t1+t2 max1Save-K*, 02
where
K*=t1+t2
t2 K-t1
t2 S
When K*70, the option can be valued in the same way as a newly issued Asian option  
provided that we change the strike price from K to K* and multiply the result by  
t2>1t1+t22. When K*60 the option is certain to be exercised and can be valued as a 
forward contract. The value is
t2
t1+t2 3M1e-rt2-K*e-rt24
Another type of Asian option is an average strike option. An average strike call pays off 
max10, ST-Save2 and an average strike put pays off max10, Save-ST2. Average strike 
options can guarantee that the average price paid for an asset in frequent trading over a  
period of time is not greater than the final price. Alternatively, it can guarantee that the average price received for an asset in frequent trading over a period of time is not less  
than the final price. It can be valued as an option to exchange one asset for another when 
Save is assumed to be lognormal.
26.14 OPTIONS TO EXCHANGE ONE ASSET FOR ANOTHER
Options to exchange one asset for another (sometimes referred to as exchange options) arise in various contexts. An option to buy yen with Australian dollars is, from the  
point of view of a U.S. investor, an option to exchange one foreign currency asset for 
M26_HULL0654_11_GE_C26.indd   627 12/05/2021   18:19628 CHAPTER 26
another foreign currency asset. A stock tender offer is an option to exchange shares in 
one stock for shares in another stock.
Consider a European option to give up an asset worth UT at time T and receive in 
return an asset worth VT. The payoff from the option is
max1VT-UT, 02
A formula for valuing this option was first produced by Margrabe.12 Suppose that the 
asset prices, U and V, both follow geometric Brownian motion with volatilities sU and 
sV. Suppose further that the instantaneous correlation between U and V is r, and the 
yields provided by U and V are qU and qV, respectively. The value of the option at time 
zero is
 V0e-qvTN1d12-U0e-qUTN1d22 (26.5)
where
d1=ln1V0>U02+1qU-qV+sn2>22T
sn2T, d2=d1-sn2T
and
sn=2s2
U+s2
V-2rsUsV
and U0 and V0 are the values of U and V at times zero.
This result will be proved in Chapter 28. It is interesting to note that equation (26.5) 
is independent of the risk-free rate r. This is because, as r increases, the growth rate of  
both asset prices in a risk-neutral world increases, but this is exactly offset by an  
increase in the discount rate. The variable sn is the volatility of V>U. Comparisons with 
equation (17.4) show that the option price is the same as the price of U0 European call 
options on an asset worth V>U when the strike price is 1.0, the risk-free interest rate is 
qU, and the dividend yield on the asset is qV. Mark Rubinstein shows that the American 
version of this option can be characterized similarly for valuation purposes.13 It can be 
regarded as U0 American options to buy an asset worth V>U for 1.0 when the risk-free 
interest rate is qU and the dividend yield on the asset is qV. The option can therefore be  
valued as described in Chapter 21 using a binomial tree.
An option to obtain the better or worse of two assets can be regarded as a position in  
one of the assets combined with an option to exchange it for the other asset:
min1UT, VT2=VT-max1VT-UT, 02
max1UT, VT2=UT+max1VT-UT, 02
12  See W. Margrabe, “The Value of an Option to Exchange One Asset for Another,” Journal of Finance, 33 
(March 1978): 177–86.
13  See M. Rubinstein, “One for Another,” Risk, July/August 1991: 30–3226.15 OPTIONS INVOLVING SEVERAL ASSETS
Options involving two or more risky assets are sometimes referred to as rainbow options.  
One example is the bond futures contract traded on the CBOT described in Chapter 6.  
The party with the short position is allowed to choose between a large number of  
different bonds when making delivery.
M26_HULL0654_11_GE_C26.indd   628 12/05/2021   18:19Exotic Options 629
Probably the most popular option involving several assets is a European basket 
option. This is an option where the payoff is dependent on the value of a portfolio  
(or basket) of assets. The assets are usually either individual stocks or stock indices or 
currencies. A European basket option can be valued with Monte Carlo simulation, by assuming that the assets follow correlated geometric Brownian motion processes. A much faster approach is to calculate the first two moments of the basket at the maturity  
of the option in a risk-neutral world, and then assume that value of the basket is  
lognormally distributed at that time. The option can then be valued using Black’s  
model with the parameters shown in equations (26.3) and (26.4). In this case,
M
1=an
i=1Fi and M2=an
i=1an
j=1FiFjerijsisjT
where n is the number of assets, T is the option maturity, Fi and si are the forward price 
and volatility of the ith asset, and rij is the correlation between the ith and jth asset.  
See Technical Note 28 at www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull/TechnicalNotes.
26.16 VOLATILITY AND VARIANCE SWAPS
A volatility swap is an agreement to exchange the realized volatility of an asset between time 0 and time T for a prespecifed fixed volatility. The realized volatility is usually  
calculated as described in Section 15.4 but with the assumption that the mean daily return is zero. Suppose that there are n daily observations on the asset price during the period between time 0 and time T. The realized volatility is
s=A252
n-2an-1
i=1c ln aSi+1
Sibd2
where Si is the ith observation on the asset price. (Sometimes n-1 might replace n-2  
in this formula.)
The payoff from the volatility swap at time T to the payer of the fixed volatility is 
Lvol1s-sK2, where Lvol is the notional principal and sK is the fixed volatility. Whereas 
an option provides a complex exposure to the asset price and volatility, a volatility swap is simpler in that it has exposure only to volatility.
A variance swap is an agreement to exchange the realized variance rate 
V between 
time 0 and time T for a prespecified variance rate. The variance rate is the square of  
the volatility 1V=s22. Variance swaps are easier to value than volatility swaps. This is  
because the variance rate between time 0 and time T can be replicated using a  
portfolio of put and call options. The payoff from a variance swap at time T to  
the payer of the fixed variance rate is Lvar1V-VK2, where Lvar is the notional  
principal and VK is the fixed variance rate. Often the notional principal for a variance 
swap is expressed in terms of the corresponding notional principal for a volatility swap using 
Lvar=Lvol>12sK2.
Valuation of Variance Swap
Technical Note 22 at www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull/TechnicalNotes shows that, for any value 
S* of the asset price, the expected average variance between times 0

the price of a European call option with strike price K and time to maturity T, and  
p(K) is the price of a European put option with strike price K and time to  
maturity T.
This provides a way of valuing a variance swap.14 The value of an agreement to 
receive the realized variance between time 0 and time T  and pay a variance rate of VK, 
with both being applied to a principal of Lvar, is
 Lvar3En1V2-VK4e-rT (26.7)
Suppose that the prices of European options with strike prices Ki11…i…n2 are known,  
where K16K26g6Kn. A standard approach for implementing equation (26.6) is to  
set S* equal to the first strike price below F0 and then approximate the integrals as

where ∆Ki=0.51Ki+1-Ki-12 for 2…i…n-1, ∆K1=K2-K1, ∆Kn=Kn-Kn-1.  
The function Q1Ki2 is the price of a European put option with strike price Ki if Ki6S* 
and the price of a European call option with strike price Ki if Ki7S*. When Ki=S*,  
the function Q1Ki2 is equal to the average of the prices of a European call and a  
European put with strike price Ki.
Example 26.4
Consider a 3-month contract to receive the realized variance rate of an index over 
the 3 months and pay a variance rate of 0.045 on a principal of $100 million. The risk-free rate is 4% and the dividend yield on the index is 1%. The current level of  
the index is 1020. Suppose that, for strike prices of 800, 850, 900, 950, 1,000, 1,050, 1,100, 1,150, 1,200, the 3-month implied volatilities of the index are 29%, 28%, 27%, 26%, 25%, 24%, 23%, 22%, 21%, respectively. In this case, 
n=9, 
K1=800, K2=850, c, K9=1,200, F0=1,020e10.04-0.012*0.25=1,027.68, and 
S*=1,000. DerivaGem shows that Q1K12=2.22, Q1K22=5.22, Q1K32=11.05,  
Q1K42=21.27, Q1K52=51.21, Q1K62=38.94, Q1K72=20.69, Q1K82=9.44,

100*10.0621-0.0452e-0.04*0.25=1.69.
Valuation of a Volatility Swap
To value a volatility swap, we require En1s2, where s is, as before, the realized volatility 
between time 0 and time T. We can write
s=2En1V2A1+V-En1V2
En1V2
Expanding the second term on the right-hand side in a series gives the approximation:
s=2En1V2e1+V-En1V2

En1V2d2

Taking expectations,
 En1s2=2En1V2e1-1
8cvar1V2
En1V22df (26.9)
where var1V2 is the variance of V. The valuation of a volatility swap therefore requires 
an estimate of the variance of the realized variance rate during the life of the contract. 
The value of an agreement to receive the realized volatility between time 0 and time T and pay a volatility of 
sK, with both being applied to a principal of Lvol, is
Lvol3En1s2-sK4e-rT
Example 26.5
For the situation in Example 26.4, consider a volatility swap where the realized  
volatility is received and a volatility of 23% is paid on a principal of $100 million.  
In this case En1V2=0.0621. Suppose that the standard deviation of the realized  
variance over 3 months has been estimated as 0.01. This means that  
var1V2=0.0001. Equation (26.9) gives
En1s2=20.0621 a1-1
8*0.0001
0.06212b=0.2484
The value of the swap in (millions of dollars) is

M26_HULL0654_11_GE_C26.indd   631 12/05/2021   18:19632 CHAPTER 26
Since 2004 the VIX volatility index (see Section 15.11) has been based on equa-
tion ( 26.10). The procedure used on any given day is to calculate En1V2T for options that  
trade in the market and have maturities immediately above and below 30 days. The 30-day  
risk-neutral expected cumulative variance is calculated from these two numbers using 
interpolation. This is then multiplied by 365/30 and the index is set equal to the square root of the result. More details on the calculation can be found on the CBOE website.
26.17 STATIC OPTIONS REPLICATION
If the procedures described in Chapter 19 are used for hedging exotic options, some are  
easy to handle, but others are very difficult because of discontinuities (see Business Snapshot 26.1). For the difficult cases, a technique known as static options replication is  
sometimes useful.
15 This involves searching for a portfolio of actively traded options that  
approximately replicates the exotic option. Shorting this position provides the hedge.16
The basic principle underlying static options replication is as follows. If two portfolios  
are worth the same on a certain boundary, they are also worth the same at all interior points of the boundary. Consider as an example a 9-month up-and-out call option on a non-dividend-paying stock where the stock price is 50, the strike price is 50, the barrier is  
60, the risk-free interest rate is 10% per annum, and the volatility is 30% per annum. Suppose that f (S, t) is the value of the option at time t for a stock price of S. Any  
boundary in (S, t) space can be used for the purposes of producing the replicating  
portfolio. A convenient one to choose is shown in Figure 26.1. It is defined by 
S=60 
and t=0.75. The values of the up-and-out option on the boundary are given by
 f1S, 0.752=max1S-50, 02 when S660
f160, t2=0 when 0…t…0.75
There are many ways that these boundary values can be approximately matched 
using regular options. The natural option to match the first boundary is a 9-month European call with a strike price of 50. The first component of the replicating portfolio is therefore one unit of this option. (We refer to this option as option A.)
One way of matching the f (60, t) boundary is to proceed as follows:
1. Divide the life of the option into N steps of length 
∆t
2. Choose a European call option with a strike price of 60 and maturity at time N∆t
1= 9 months2 to match the boundary at the 560, 1N-12∆t6point
3. Choose a European call option with a strike price of 60 and maturity at  
time 1N-12∆t to match the boundary at the 560, 1N-22∆t6point
and so on. Note that the options are chosen in sequence so that they have zero value on the parts of the boundary matched by earlier options.
17 The option with a strike price  
15  See E. Derman, D. Ergener, and I. Kani, “Static Options Replication,” Journal of Derivatives 2, 4  
(Summer 1995): 78–95.
16  Technical Note 22 at www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull/TechnicalNotes provides an example of static  
replication. It shows that the variance rate of an asset can be replicated by a position in the asset and out-of-the- 
money options on the asset. This result, which leads to equation (26.6), can be used to hedge variance swaps.
17  This is not a requirement. If K points on the boundary are to be matched, we can choose K options and 
solve a set of K linear equations to determine required positions in the options.
M26_HULL0654_11_GE_C26.indd   632 12/05/2021   18:19Exotic Options 633
of 60 that matures in 9 months has zero value on the vertical boundary that is matched 
by option A. The option maturing at time i ∆t has zero value at the point 560, i ∆t6that  
is matched by the option maturing at time 1i+12∆t for 1…i…N-1.
Suppose that ∆t=0.25. In addition to option A, the replicating portfolio consists of  
positions in European options with strike price 60 that mature in 9, 6, and 3 months.  
We will refer to these as options B, C, and D, respectively. Given our assumptions  Business Snapshot 26.1 Is Delta Hedging Easier or More Difficult  
  for Exotics?
As described in Chapter 19, we can approach the hedging of exotic options by  
creating a delta neutral position and rebalancing frequently to maintain delta  
neutrality. When we do this we find some exotic options are easier to hedge than plain vanilla options and some are more difficult.
An example of an exotic option that is relatively easy to hedge is an average price 
option where the averaging period is the whole life of the option. As time passes, we observe more of the asset prices that will be used in calculating the final average. This  
means that our uncertainty about the payoff decreases with the passage of time. As a  
result, the option becomes progressively easier to hedge. In the final few days, the delta of the option always approaches zero because price movements during this time  
have very little impact on the payoff.
By contrast barrier options are relatively difficult to hedge. Consider a down-and-
out call option on a currency when the exchange rate is 0.0005 above the barrier. If the barrier is hit, the option is worth nothing. If the barrier is not hit, the option may prove to be quite valuable. The delta of the option is discontinuous at the barrier making conventional hedging very difficult.

about volatility and interest rates, option B is worth 4.33 at the {60, 0.5} point.  
Option A is worth 11.54 at this point. The position in option B necessary to match  
the boundary at the {60, 0.5} point is therefore -11.54>4.33=-2.66. Option C is worth  
4.33 at the {60, 0.25} point. The position taken in options A and B is worth -4.21 at 
this point. The position in option C necessary to match the boundary at the {60, 0.25} 
point is therefore 4.21>4.33=0.97. Similar calculations show that the position in 
option D necessary to match the boundary at the {60, 0} point is 0.28.
The portfolio chosen is summarized in Table 26.1. (See also Sample Application F of  
the DerivaGem Applications.) It is worth 0.73 initially (i.e., at time zero when the stock price is 50). This compares with 0.31 given by the analytic formula for the up-and-out  
call earlier in this chapter. The replicating portfolio is not exactly the same as the up- and-out option because it matches the latter at only three points on the second  
boundary. If we use the same procedure, but match at 18 points on the second  
boundary (using options that mature every half month), the value of the replicating portfolio reduces to 0.38. If 100 points are matched, the value reduces further to 0.32.
To hedge a derivative, the portfolio that replicates its boundary conditions must be 
shorted. The hedge lasts until the end of the life of the derivative or until the boundary is reached, whichever happens first. If the boundary is reached, the hedge portfolio must  
be unwound and a new hedge portfolio set up.
Static options replication has the advantage over delta hedging that it does not 
require frequent rebalancing. It can be used for a wide range of derivatives. The user has a great deal of flexibility in choosing the boundary that is to be matched and the options that are to be used.
SUMMARY
Exotic options are options with rules governing the payoff that are more complicated than standard options. We have discussed 15 different types of exotic options: packages, perpetual American options, nonstandard American options, gap options, forward start options, cliquet options, compound options, chooser options, barrier options, binary options, lookback options, shout options, Asian options, options to exchange one asset for another, and options involving several assets. We have discussed how these can be valued using the same assumptions as those used to derive the Black–Scholes–Merton model in Chapter 15. Some can be valued analytically, but using much more complicated  
formulas than those for regular European calls and puts, some can be handled using analytic approximations, and some can be valued using extensions of the numerical  Option Strike

procedures in Chapter 21. We will present more numerical procedures for valuing exotic  
options in Chapter 27.
Some exotic options are easier to hedge than the corresponding regular options;  
others are more difficult. In general, Asian options are easier to hedge because the  
payoff becomes progressively more certain as we approach maturity. Barrier options can 
be more difficult to hedge because delta is discontinuous at the barrier. One approach to hedging an exotic option, known as static options replication, is to find a portfolio of regular options whose value matches the value of the exotic option on some boundary. The exotic option is hedged by shorting this portfolio.

 26.27. Sample Application F in the DerivaGem Application Builder Software considers the 
static options replication example in Section 26.17. It shows the way a hedge can be  
constructed using four options (as in Section 26.17) and two ways a hedge can be  
constructed using 16 options.
M26_HULL0654_11_GE_C26.indd   637 12/05/2021   18:19638 CHAPTER 26
(a) Explain the difference between the two ways a hedge can be constructed using  
16 options. Explain intuitively why the second method works better.
(b) Improve on the four-option hedge by changing Tmat for the third and fourth options.
(c) Check how well the 16-option portfolios match the delta, gamma, and vega of the 
barrier option.
 26.28. Consider a down-and-out call option on a foreign currency. The initial exchange rate is  
0.90, the time to maturity is 2 years, the strike price is 1.00, the barrier is 0.80, the  
domestic risk-free interest rate is 5%, the foreign risk-free interest rate is 6%, and the 
volatility is 25% per annum. Use DerivaGem to develop a static option replication  
strategy involving five options.
 26.29. Suppose that a stock index is currently 900. The dividend yield is 2%, the risk-free rate is  
5%, and the volatility is 40%. Use the results in Technical Note 27 on the author’s  
website to calculate the value of a 1-year average price call where the strike price is 900  
and the index level is observed at the end of each quarter for the purposes of the  
averaging. Compare this with the price calculated by DerivaGem for a 1-year average 
price option where the price is observed continuously. Provide an intuitive explanation for any differences between the prices.
 26.30. Use the DerivaGem Application Builder software to compare the effectiveness of daily 
delta hedging for (a) the option considered in Tables 19.2 and 19.3 and (b) an average price call with the same parameters. Use Sample Application C. For the average price option you will find it necessary to change the calculation of the option price in cell C16, the payoffs in cells H15 and H16, and the deltas (cells G46 to G186 and N46 to N186). Carry out 20 Monte Carlo simulation runs for each option by repeatedly pressing F9.  
On each run record the cost of writing and hedging the option, the volume of trading over the whole 20 weeks and the volume of trading between weeks 11 and 20. Comment on the results.
 26.31. In the DerivaGem Application Builder Software modify Sample Application D to test  
the effectiveness of delta and gamma hedging for a call on call compound option on a 
100,000 units of a foreign currency where the exchange rate is 0.67, the domestic risk-free rate is 5%, the foreign risk-free rate is 6%, the volatility is 12%. The time to maturity of  
the first option is 20 weeks, and the strike price of the first option is 0.015. The second  
option matures 40 weeks from today and has a strike price of 0.68. Explain how you  
modified the cells. Comment on hedge effectiveness.
 26.32. Outperformance certificates (also called “sprint certificates,” “accelerator certificates,” 
or “speeders”) are offered to investors by many European banks as a way of investing in  
a company’s stock. The initial investment equals the stock price, 
S0. If the stock price 
goes up between time 0 and time T, the investor gains k times the increase at time T, where k is a constant greater than 1.0. However, the stock price used to calculate the gain  
at time T is capped at some maximum level M. If the stock price goes down, the  
investor’s loss is equal to the decrease. The investor does not receive dividends.
(a) Show that an outperformance certificate is a package.
(b) Calculate using DerivaGem the value of a one-year outperformance certificate when 
the stock price is 50 euros, 
k=1.5, M=70 euros, the risk-free rate is 5%, and the 
stock price volatility is 25%. Dividends equal to 0.5 euros are expected in 2 months, 5 months, 8 months, and 11 months.

 26.33. Carry out the analysis in Example 26.4 of Section 26.16 to value the variance swap on  
the assumption that the life of the swap is 1 month rather than 3 months.
 26.34. What is the relationship between a regular call option, a binary call option, and a gap  
call option?
 26.35. Produce a formula for valuing a cliquet option where an amount Q is invested to  
produce a payoff at the end of n periods. The return earned each period is the greater  
of the return on an index (excluding dividends) and zero.

More on Models 
and Numerical 
Procedures
Up to now the models we have used to value options have been based on the geometric  
Brownian motion model of asset price behavior that underlies the Black–Scholes– 
Merton formulas and the numerical procedures we have used have been relatively straightforward. In this chapter we introduce a number of new models and explain  
how the numerical procedures can be adapted to cope with particular situations.
Chapter 20 explained how traders overcome the weaknesses in the geometric Brown-
ian motion model by using volatility surfaces. A volatility surface determines an  
appropriate volatility to substitute into Black–Scholes–Merton when pricing plain vanilla options. Unfortunately it says little about the volatility that should be used  
for exotic options when the pricing formulas of Chapter 26 are used. Suppose the  
volatility surface shows that the correct volatility to use when pricing a one-year plain vanilla option with a strike price of $40 is 27%. This is liable to be totally inappropriate for pricing a barrier option (or some other exotic option) that has a strike price of $40 and a life of one year.
The first part of this chapter discusses a number of alternatives to geometric  
Brownian motion that are designed to deal with the problem of pricing exotic options consistently with plain vanilla options. These alternative asset price processes fit the market prices of plain vanilla options better than geometric Brownian motion. As a result, we can have more confidence in using them to value exotic options.
The second part of the chapter extends the discussion of numerical procedures. It 
explains how convertible bonds and some types of path-dependent derivatives can be valued using trees. It discusses the special problems associated with valuing barrier  
options numerically and how these problems can be handled. Finally, it outlines  
alternative ways of constructing trees for two correlated variables and shows how Monte Carlo simulation can be used to value derivatives when there are early exercise opportunities.
As in earlier chapters, results are presented for derivatives dependent on an asset 
providing a yield at rate q. For an option on a stock index, q should be set equal to the 
dividend yield on the index; for an option on a currency, it should be set equal to the foreign risk-free rate; for an option on a futures contract, it should be set equal to the domestic risk-free rate.27 CHAPTER  
M27_HULL0654_11_GE_C27.indd   640 30/04/2021   17:45More on Models and Numerical Procedures 641
The Black–Scholes–Merton model assumes that an asset’s price changes continously in  
a way that produces a lognormal distribution for the price at any future time. There are  
many alternative processes that can be assumed. One possibility is to retain the property  
that the asset price changes continuously, but assume a process other than geometric 
Brownian motion. Another alternative is to overlay continuous asset price changes with  
jumps. Yet another alternative is to assume a process where all the asset price changes that take place are jumps. We will consider examples of all three types of processes in this section. In particular, we will consider the constant elasticity of variance model, Merton’s mixed jump–diffusion model, and the variance-gamma model. All three  
models are implemented in DerivaGem. The types of processes we consider in this section are known collectively as Levy processes.
1
The Constant Elasticity of Variance Model
One alternative to Black–Scholes–Merton is the constant elasticity of variance (CEV) model. This is a diffusion model where the risk-neutral process for a stock price S is
dS=1r-q2S dt+sSb dz
where r is the risk-free rate, q is the dividend yield, dz is a Wiener process, s is a  
volatility parameter, and b is a positive constant.2 The parameter s is roughly  
equivalent to the volatility in the usual lognormal model multiplied by S1-b.
When b=1, the CEV model is the geometric Brownian motion model we have been  
using up to now. When b61, the volatility increases as the stock price decreases. This 
creates a probability distribution similar to that observed for equities with a heavy left tail and less heavy right tail (see Figure 20.4).
3 When b71, the volatility increases as 
the stock price increases. This creates a probability distribution with a heavy right tail  
and a less heavy left tail. This corresponds to a volatility smile where the implied  
volatility is an increasing function of the strike price. This type of volatility smile is sometimes observed for options on futures.
The valuation formulas for European call and put options under the CEV model are
 c=S0e-qT31-x21a, b+2, c24-Ke-rTx21c, b, a2
 p=Ke-rT31-x21c, b, a24-S0e-qTx21a, b+2, c2

1  Roughly speaking, a Levy process is a continuous-time stochastic process with stationary independent 
increments.

Financial Economics, 3 (March 1976): 145–66.
3  The reason is as follows. As the stock price decreases, the volatility increases making even lower stock price 
more likely; when the stock price increases, the volatility decreases making higher stock prices less likely.

and x21z, k, v2 is the cumulative probability that a variable with a noncentral x2  
distribution with noncentrality parameter v and k degrees of freedom is less than z.  
A procedure for computing x21z, k, v2 is provided in Technical Note 12 on the author’s 
website: www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull/TechnicalNotes.
The CEV model is useful for valuing exotic equity options. The parameters of the 
model can be chosen to fit the prices of plain vanilla options as closely as possible by  
minimizing the sum of the squared differences between model prices and market  
prices.
Merton’s Mixed Jump–Diffusion Model
Merton has suggested a model where jumps are combined with continuous changes.4 
Define:
l:  Average number of jumps per year
k:  Average jump size, measured as a percentage of the asset price
The percentage jump size is assumed to be drawn from a probability distribution in the  
model.
The probability of a jump in time ∆t is l∆t. The average growth rate in the asset  
price from the jumps is therefore lk. The risk-neutral process for the asset price is
dS
S=1r-q-lk2 dt+s dz+dp
where dz is a Wiener process, dp is the Poisson process generating the jumps, and s is 
the volatility of the non-jump component of S. The processes dz and dp are assumed 
to be independent.
An important particular case of Merton’s model is where the logarithm of one plus 
the size of the percentage jump is normal. Assume that the standard deviation of the normal distribution is s. Merton shows that a European option price can then be written
a∞
n=0e-l/uni2032T1l/uni2032T2n
n! fn
where l/uni2032=l11+k2. The variable fn is the Black–Scholes–Merton option price when the  
dividend yield is q, the variance rate is
s2+ns2
T

Financial Economics, 3 (March 1976): 125–44.

and the risk-free rate is
r-lk+ng
T
where g=ln11+k2.
This model gives rise to heavier left and heavier right tails than Black–Scholes– 
Merton. It can be used for pricing currency options. As in the case of the CEV model, 
the model parameters are chosen by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between model prices and market prices.
Simulating Jumps
Models that involve jumps can be implemented with Monte Carlo simulation. When jumps are generated by a Poisson process, the probability of exactly m jumps in time t is
e-lt1lt2m
m!
where l is the average number of jumps per year. Equivalently, lt is the average number 
of jumps in time t.
Suppose that on average 0.5 jumps happen per year. The probability of m jumps in 
2 years is
e-0.5*210.5*22m
m!
Table 27.1 gives the probability and cumulative probability of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8  
jumps in 2 years. (The numbers in a table such as this can be calculated using the  
POISSON function in Excel.)
To simulate a process following jumps over 2 years, it is necessary to determine on 
each simulation trial:
1. The number of jumps
2. The size of each jump.
To determine the number of jumps, on each simulation trial we sample a random  
number between 0 and 1 and use Table 27.1 as a look-up table. If the random number is between 0 and 0.3679, no jumps occur; if the random number is between 0.3679 and

0.7358, one jump occurs; if the random number is between 0.7358 and 0.9197, two jumps 
occur; and so on. To determine the size of each jump, it is necessary on each simulation trial to sample from the probability distribution for the jump size once for each jump that occurs. Once the number of jumps and the jump sizes have been determined, the final value of the variable being simulated is known for the simulation trial.
In a mixed jump–diffusion model, jumps are superimposed upon the usual lognormal  
diffusion process that is assumed for stock prices. The process then has two components (the usual diffusion component and the jump component) and each must be sampled separately. The diffusion component is sampled as described in Sections 21.6 and 21.7 while the jump component is sampled as just described. When derivatives are valued, it  
is important to ensure that the overall expected return from the asset (from both  
components) is the risk-free rate.
The Variance-Gamma Model
An example of a pure jump model that is proving quite popular is the variance-gamma 
model.5 Define a variable g as the change over time T in a variable that follows a  
gamma process with mean rate of 1 and variance rate of v. A gamma process is a pure jump process where small jumps occur very frequently and large jumps occur only occasionally. The probability density for g is
gT>v-1e-g>v
vT>vΓ1T>v2
where Γ1#2 denotes the gamma function. This probability density can be computed in 
Excel using the GAMMADIST 1#, #, #, #2 function. The first argument of the function is  
g, the second is T>v, the third is v, and the fourth is TRUE or FALSE, where TRUE 
returns the cumulative probability distribution function and FALSE returns the prob-ability density function we have just given.
As usual, we define 
ST as the asset price at time T, S0 as the asset price today, r as the  
risk-free interest rate, and q as the dividend yield. Conditional on g, ln ST has a risk- 
neutral probability distribution under the variance-gamma model that is normal. The conditional mean is
ln S0+1r-q2T+v+ug
and the conditional standard deviation is
s2g
where
v=1T>v2 ln11-uv-s2v>22
The variance-gamma model has three parameters: v, s, and u.6 The parameter v is the 
variance rate of the gamma process, s is the volatility, and u is a parameter defining 
skewness. When u=0, ln ST is symmetric; when u60, it is negatively skewed (as for 
equities); and when u70, it is positively skewed.
5   See D. B. Madan, P. P. Carr, and E. C. Chang, “The Variance-Gamma Process and Option Pricing,” 
 European Finance Review, 2 (1998): 79–105.
6  Note that all these parameters are liable to change when we move from the real world to the risk-neutral 
world. This is in contrast to pure diffusion models where the volatility remains the same.
M27_HULL0654_11_GE_C27.indd   644 30/04/2021   17:45More on Models and Numerical Procedures 645
Suppose that we are interested in using Excel to obtain 10,000 random samples of the 
change in an asset price between time 0 and time T using the variance-gamma model. 
As a preliminary, we could set cells E1, E2, E3, E4, E5, E6, and E7 equal to T, v, u, s, r,  
q, and S0, respectively. We could also set E8 equal to v by defining it as
=$E$1 * LN11-$E$3 * $E$2-$E$4 * $E$4 * $E$2>22>$E$2
We could then proceed as follows:
1. Sample values for g using the GAMMAINV function. Set the contents of cells A1, A2, . . . , A10000 as
=GAMMAINV1RAND12,  $ E$1>$E$2,  $E$22
2. For each value of g we sample a value z for a variable that is normally distributed 
with mean ug and standard deviation s2g. This can be done by defining cell B1 as
=A1 * $E$3+SQRT1A1 2 * $E$4 * NORMSINV1RAND122
and cells B2, B3, . . . , B10000 similarly.
3. The stock price ST is given by
ST=S0 exp31r-q2T+v+z4
By defining C1 as
=$E$7 * EXP11$E$5-$E$62 * $E$1+B1+$E$8)
and C2, C3, . . . , C10000 similarly, random samples from the distribution of ST are 
created in these cells.

Figure 27.1 shows the probability distribution that is obtained using the variance- 
gamma model for ST when S0=100, T=0.5, v=0.5, u=0.1, s=0.2, and  
r=q=0. For comparison it also shows the distribution given by geometric Brownian 
motion when the volatility, s is 0.2 (or 20%). Although not clear in Figure 27.1, the 
variance-gamma distribution has heavier tails than the lognormal distribution given by 
geometric Brownian motion.
One way of characterizing the variance-gamma distribution is that g defines the rate 
at which information arrives during time T. If g is large, a great deal of information  
arrives and the sample we take from a normal distribution in step 2 above has a  
relatively large mean and variance. If g is small, relatively little information arrives  
and the sample we take has a relatively small mean and variance. The parameter T is the  
usual time measure, and g is sometimes referred to as measuring economic time or time adjusted for the flow of information.
Semi-analytic European option valuation formulas are provided by Madan et al. 
(1998). The variance-gamma model tends to produce a U-shaped volatility smile. The smile is not necessarily symmetrical. It is very pronounced for short maturities and “dies  
away” for long maturities. The model can be fitted to either equity or foreign currency plain vanilla option prices.
27.2 STOCHASTIC VOLATILITY MODELS
The Black–Scholes–Merton model assumes that volatility is constant. In practice, as discussed in Chapter 23, volatility varies through time. The variance-gamma model reflects this with its g variable. Low values of g correspond to a low arrival rate for information and a low volatility; high values of g correspond to a high arrival rate for information and a high volatility.
An alternative to the variance-gamma model is a model where the process followed 
by the volatility variable is specified explicitly. Suppose first that the volatility parameter  
in the geometric Brownian motion is a known function of time. The risk-neutral process followed by the asset price is then
 
dS=1r-q2S dt+s1t2S dz (27.1)
The Black–Scholes–Merton formulas are then correct provided that the variance rate is 
set equal to the average variance rate during the life of the option (see Problem 27.6). The variance rate is the square of the volatility. Suppose that during a 1-year period the volatility of a stock will be 20% during the first 6 months and 30% during the second  
6 months. The average variance rate is
0.5*0.202+0.5*0.302=0.065
It is correct to use Black–Scholes–Merton with a variance rate of 0.065. This corre-sponds to a volatility of 
20.065=0.255, or 25.5%.
Equation (27.1) assumes that the instantaneous volatility of an asset is perfectly 
predictable. In practice, volatility varies stochastically. This has led to the develop-ment of more complex models with two stochastic variables: the stock price and its volatility.
M27_HULL0654_11_GE_C27.indd   646 30/04/2021   17:45More on Models and Numerical Procedures 647
One model that has been used by researchers is
 dS>S=1r-q2 dt+2V dzS (27.2)
 dV=a1VL-V2 dt+jVa dzV (27.3)
where a, VL, j, and a are constants, and dzS and dzV are Wiener processes. The variable V  
in this model is the asset’s variance rate. The variance rate has a drift that pulls it back to  
a level VL at rate a.
Hull and White show that, when volatility is stochastic but uncorrelated with the asset  
price, the price of a European option is the Black–Scholes–Merton price integrated over  
the probability distribution of the average variance rate during the life of the option.7 
Thus, a European call price is
3∞
0c1V2 g1V2 dV
where V is the average value of the variance rate, c is the Black–Scholes–Merton price 
expressed as a function of V, and g is the probability density function of V in a risk- 
neutral world. This result can be used to show that Black–Scholes–Merton overprices 
options that are at the money or close to the money, and underprices options that are deep-in-or deep-out-of-the-money. The model is consistent with the pattern of implied volatilities observed for currency options (see Section 20.2).
The case where the asset price and volatility are correlated is more complicated. Option  
prices can be obtained using Monte Carlo simulation. In the particular case where 
a=0.5, Hull and White provide a series expansion and Heston provides an analytic 
result.8 The pattern of implied volatilities obtained when the volatility is negatively 
correlated with the asset price is similar to that observed for equities (see Section 20.3).9
Chapter 23 discusses exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) and 
GARCH(1,1) models. These are alternative approaches to characterizing a stochastic volatility model. Duan shows that it is possible to use GARCH(1,1) as the basis for an internally consistent option pricing model.
10 (See Problem 23.14 for the equivalence of 
GARCH(1,1) and stochastic volatility models.)
The SABR Model
A stochastic volatility model that has become very popular with practitioners for  
valuing European options (particularly interest rate options) maturing at a particular time T is the SABR model developed by Hagan et al. (2002).
11 The advantage of the

Finance, 42 (June 1987): 281–300. This result is independent of the process followed by the variance rate.

Options with Stochastic Volatility with Applications to Bonds and Currency Options,” Review of Financial 
Studies, 6, 2 (1993): 327–43. The Heston model is implemented in DerivaGem 4.00.

September 2002: 84–108, and also www.math.ku.dk/~rolf/SABR.pdf. SABR is short for “stochastic alpha, beta, and rho.” We use s instead of Hagan et al.’s 
a.
M27_HULL0654_11_GE_C27.indd   647 30/04/2021   17:45648 CHAPTER 27
model is that it can fit the volatility smiles observed in practice reasonably well and is 
useful for managing risks associated with movements in the smile through time.
The model is
 dF=sFb dz
ds
s=v dw
where F is a forward interest rate or the forward price of an asset, dz and dw are  
Wiener processes, s is the stochastic volatility, and b and v  are constants.12 Three other 
parameters are r, the correlation between dz and dw, s0, the initial value of s, and F0, 
the initial value of F.
Hagan et al. derive an approximate formula for the Black-model implied volatility 
given by SABR for a European option with strike price K (see Sections 18.7 and 18.8 for  
Black’s model). Define
x=1F0K211-b2>2,  y=11-b2 ln1F0>K2

The implied volatility is ABf>x. If F0=K, this becomes s0B>1F1-b
02.13
The parameter s0 defines the level of the volatility. (It is roughly equivalent to the 
volatility estimate in the usual lognormal model multiplied by F1-b
0.) The parameter r  
defines the shape of the smile. For a large positive r, the smile is upward sloping; for a  
large negative r, it is downward sloping; and for intermediate values of r, it is  
U-shaped. As the parameter v increases, the smile become more accentuated. (See 
Problem 27.23.) The SABR model is implemented in DerivaGem 4.00.
Often b is chosen equal to 0.5 in interest rate applications of the SABR model. The  
parameters r, s0, and v that fit the smile typically depend on the maturity T being  
considered. However, as mentioned earlier, the model has proved a useful way of  
managing the risks in smile movements.
Rough Volatility Models
In Section 14.8, we introduced fractional Brownian motion. Gatheral, Jaisson, and 
Rosenbaum (2018) argue that fractional Brownian motion gives a better description of the behavior of volatility than regular Brownian motion.
14 Using high-frequency data, 
they find that a Hurst exponent between 0.06 and 0.20 fits the behavior of a range of  
different stock indices well. It also fits the volatility surfaces that are observed in practice  
12  This is the process for F in a world where F has zero drift. When interest rates are stochastic, it is correct  
to discount the expected payoff from the derivative in this world from time T to time zero at the T-year rate. 
This is explained in the next chapter.
13  Other researchers have come up with slightly more accurate formulas, but this is the one that is most  
widely used.
14  See J. Gatheral, T. Jaisson, and M. Rosenbaum, “Volatility is Rough,” Quantitative Finance, 18, 6 (2018): 
933–949.
M27_HULL0654_11_GE_C27.indd   648 30/04/2021   17:45More on Models and Numerical Procedures 649
better than simpler stochastic volatility models. Models which are based on fractional 
Brownian motion are known as rough volatility models.
One well-known rough volatility model is referred to as “rough Heston.” It has the  
advantage of being analytically tractable. The original Heston model is given by  
equations (27.2) and (27.3) with a=0.5 and can be written as
dSt
St=1r-q2 dt+2Vt1r dzt+21-r2 dwt2
dVt=a1VL-Vt2 dt+j2Vt dzt
where dzt and dwt are uncorrelated Wiener processes and r is the correlation between 
the stock price and its volatility. In the rough Heston model the process followed by the variance rate involves fractional Brownian motion rather than regular Brownian motion.
To value exotic options it is often necessary use Monte Carlo simulation. As  
explained in Section 14.8, in fractional Brownian motion the change in a future time  
period must be simulated so that it has the right correlation with changes in all  
previous time periods. This is computationally very slow and has led Jaber (2019) to  
suggest the lifted Heston model, which imitates rough Heston using only regular Brownian motion.
15
15  See, for example, O. El Euch, J. Gatheral, and M. Rosenbaum, “Roughening Heston,” Risk, May (2019):  
84–89, for a discussion of the rough volatility model, and E. A. Jaber, “Lifting the Heston Model,”  
Quantitative Finance, 19 (2019): 1995–2013, for the lifted Heston model.
16  There is a practical reason for this. If the bank does not use a model with this property, there is a danger  
that traders working for the bank will spend their time arbitraging the bank’s internal models.
17  See B. Dupire, “Pricing with a Smile,” Risk, February (1994): 18–20; E. Derman and I. Kani, “Riding on a  
Smile,” Risk, February (1994): 32–39; M. Rubinstein, “Implied Binomial Trees” Journal of Finance, 49, 3  
(July 1994), 771–818.27.3 THE IVF MODEL
The parameters of the models we have discussed so far can be chosen so that they  
provide an approximate fit to the prices of plain vanilla options on any given day.  
Financial institutions sometimes want to go one stage further and use a model that provides an exact fit to the prices of these options.
16 In 1994 Derman and Kani, Dupire, 
and Rubinstein developed a model that is designed to do this. It has become known as the implied volatility function (IVF) model or the local volatility model.
17 It provides an  
exact fit to the European option prices observed on any given day, regardless of the shape of the volatility surface.
The risk-neutral process for the asset price in the model has the form
dS=3r1t2-q1t24S dt+s1S, t2S dz
where r(t) is the instantaneous forward interest rate for a contract maturing at time t 
and q(t) is the dividend yield as a function of time. The volatility s1S, t2 is a function of 
both S and t and is chosen so that the model prices all European options consistently 
M27_HULL0654_11_GE_C27.indd   649 30/04/2021   17:45650 CHAPTER 27
with the market. It is shown both by Dupire and by Andersen and Brotherton-Ratcliffe 
that s1S, t2 can be calculated analytically:18
       3s1K, T242=2 0cmkt>0T+q1T2cmkt+K3r1T2-q1T240cmkt>0K
K2102cmkt>0K22 (27.4)
where cmkt1K, T2 is the market price of a European call option with strike price K and 
maturity T. If a sufficiently large number of European call prices are available in the 
market, this equation can be used to estimate the s1S, t2 function.19
Andersen and Brotherton-Ratcliffe implement the model by using equation (27.4) 
together with the implicit finite difference method. An alternative approach, the  
implied tree methodology suggested by Derman and Kani and Rubinstein, involves constructing a tree for the asset price that is consistent with option prices in the  
market.
When it is used in practice the IVF model is recalibrated daily to the prices of plain  
vanilla options. It is a tool to price exotic options consistently with plain vanilla  
options. As discussed in Chapter 20 plain vanilla options define the risk-neutral  
probability distribution of the asset price at all future times. It follows that the IVF model gets the risk-neutral probability distribution of the asset price at all future times  
correct. This means that options providing payoffs at just one time (e.g., cash-or- nothing and asset-or-nothing options) are priced correctly by the IVF model. However, the model does not necessarily get the joint distribution of the asset price at two or  
more times correct. This means that exotic options such as compound options and barrier options may be priced incorrectly.
20
18   See B. Dupire, “Pricing with a Smile,” Risk, February (1994), 18–20; L. B. G. Andersen and R.  
Brotherton-Ratcliffe “The Equity Option Volatility Smile: An Implicit Finite Difference Approach,” Journal 
of Computation Finance 1, No. 2 (Winter 1997/98): 5–37. Dupire considers the case where r and q are zero; Andersen and Brotherton-Ratcliffe consider the more general situation.
19  Some smoothing of the observed volatility surface is typically necessary.
20  Hull and Suo test the IVF model by assuming that all derivative prices are determined by a stochastic  
volatility model. They found that the model works reasonably well for compound options, but sometimes gives serious errors for barrier options. See J. C. Hull and W. Suo, “A Methodology for the Assessment of  
Model Risk and its Application to the Implied Volatility Function Model,” Journal of Financial and  
Quantitative Analysis, 37, 2 (June 2002): 297–31827.4 CONVERTIBLE BONDS
We now move on to discuss how the numerical procedures presented in Chapter 21 can  
be modified to handle particular valuation problems. We start by considering con-
vertible bonds.
Convertible bonds are bonds issued by a company where the holder has the option to  
exchange the bonds for the company’s stock at certain times in the future. The conversion  
ratio is the number of shares of stock obtained for one bond (this can be a function of time). The bonds are almost always callable (i.e., the issuer has the right to buy them back  
at certain times at a predetermined prices). The holder always has the right to convert the  
bond once it has been called. The call feature is therefore usually a way of forcing  
M27_HULL0654_11_GE_C27.indd   650 30/04/2021   17:45More on Models and Numerical Procedures 651
conversion earlier than the holder would otherwise choose. Sometimes the holder’s call 
option is conditional on the price of the company’s stock being above a certain level.
Credit risk plays an important role in the valuation of convertibles. If credit risk is 
ignored, poor prices are obtained because the coupons and principal payments on the bond are overvalued. Ingersoll provides a way of valuing convertibles using a model similar to Merton’s (1974) model discussed in Section 24.6.
21 He assumes geometric 
Brownian motion for the issuer’s total assets and models the company’s equity, its  
convertible debt, and its other debt as claims contingent on the value of the assets. Credit risk is taken into account because the debt holders get repaid in full only if the value of the assets exceeds the amount owing to them.
A simpler model that is widely used in practice involves modeling the issuer’s stock 
price. It is assumed that the stock follows geometric Brownian motion except that there is a probability 
l∆t that there will be a default in each short period of time ∆t. In the 
event of a default the stock price falls to zero and there is a recovery on the bond. The variable 
l is the risk-neutral hazard rate defined in Section 24.2.
The stock price process can be represented by varying the usual binomial tree so that  
at each node there is:
1. A probability pu of a percentage up movement of size u over the next time period 
of length ∆t
2. A probability pd of a percentage down movement of size d over the next time 
period of length ∆t
3. A probability l ∆t, or more accurately 1-e-l∆t, that there will be a default with 
the stock price moving to zero over the next time period of length ∆t
Assume that s is the volatility of the stock price conditional on no default and pdef is the  
probability of default. Parameter values that match s and give an overall expected return  
for the stock of r-q are:
pu=a-de-l∆t
u-d, pd=ue-l∆t-a
u-d, pdef=1-e-l∆t, u=es2∆t, d=1
u
where a=e1r-q2∆t, r is the risk-free rate, and q is the dividend yield on the stock.
The life of the tree is set equal to the life of the convertible bond. The value of the 
convertible at the final nodes of the tree is calculated based on any conversion options that the holder has at that time. We then roll back through the tree. At nodes where the  
terms of the instrument allow conversion we test whether conversion is optimal. We also test whether the position of the issuer can be improved by calling the bonds. If so, we assume that the bonds are called and retest whether conversion is optimal.
Example 27.1
Consider a 9-month zero-coupon bond issued by company XYZ with a face value 
of $100. Suppose that it can be exchanged for two shares of company XYZ’s stock at any time during the 9 months. Assume also that it is callable for $113 at any time. The initial stock price is $50, its volatility is 30% per annum, and there are no dividends. The hazard rate 
l is 1% per year, and all risk-free rates for all 
21 See J. E. Ingersoll, “A Contingent Claims Valuation of Convertible Securities,” Journal of Financial  
Economics, 4, (May 1977), 289–322.
M27_HULL0654_11_GE_C27.indd   651 30/04/2021   17:45652 CHAPTER 27
maturities are 5%. Suppose that in the event of a default the bond is worth $40 
(i.e., the recovery rate, as it is usually defined, is 40%).
Figure 27.2 shows the stock price tree that can be used to value the convertible 
when there are three time steps 1∆t=0.252. The upper number at each node is the  
stock price; the lower number is the price of the convertible bond. The tree par-  
ameters are:
u=e0.320.25=1.1618, d=1>u=0.8607
a=e0.05*0.25=1.0126, pu=0.5115, pd=0.4860, pdef=0.0025
At the three default nodes the stock price is zero and the bond price is 40.
Consider first the final nodes. At nodes G and H the bond should be converted  
and is worth twice the stock price. At nodes I and J the bond should not be  
converted and is worth 100.
Moving back through the tree enables the value to be calculated at earlier  
nodes. Consider, for example, node E. The value, if the bond is converted,  
is 2*50=$100. If it is not converted, then there is (a) a probability 0.5115 that 
it will move to node H, where the bond is worth 116.18, (b) a 0.4860 probability that it will move down to node I, where the bond is worth 100, and (c) a 0.0025 probability that it will default and be worth 40. The value of the bond if it is not converted is therefore
10.5115*116.18+0.4860*100+0.0025*402*e-0.05*0.25=106.78G

This is more than the value of 100 that it would have if converted. We deduce that  
it is not worth converting the bond at node E. Finally, we note that the bond  
issuer would not call the bond at node E because this would be offering 113 for a  
bond worth 106.78.
As another example consider node B. The value of the bond if it is converted is  
2*58.09=116.18. If it is not converted a similar calculation to that just given 
for node E gives its value as 119.54. The convertible bond holder will therefore 
choose not to convert. However, at this stage the bond issuer will call the bond for  
113 and the bond holder will then decide that converting is better than being called. The value of the bond at node B is therefore 116.18. A similar argument is  
used to arrive at the value at node D. With no conversion the value is 135.08. However, the bond is called, forcing conversion and reducing the value at the node to 134.99.
The value of the convertible is its value at the initial node A, or 107.44.
When interest is paid on the debt, it must be taken into account. At each node, when valuing the bond on the assumption that it is not converted, the present value of any interest payable on the bond in the next time step should be included. The risk-neutral hazard rate 
l can be estimated from either bond prices or credit default swap spreads.  
In a more general implementation, l, s, and r are functions of time. This can be  
handled using a trinomial rather than a binomial tree (see Section 21.4).
One disadvantage of the model we have presented is that the probability of default is  
independent of the stock price. This has led some researchers to suggest an implicit finite difference method implementation of the model where the hazard rate 
l is a 
function of the stock price as well as time.22
22 See, e.g., L. B. G. Andersen and D. Buffum, “Calibration and Implementation of Convertible Bond  
Models,” Journal of Computational Finance, 7, 1 (Winter 2003/04), 1–34. These authors suggest assuming that  
the hazard rate is inversely proportional to Sa, where S is the stock price and a is a positive constant.27.5 PATH-DEPENDENT DERIVATIVES
A path-dependent derivative (or history-dependent derivative) is a derivative where the  
payoff depends on the path followed by the price of the underlying asset, not just its  
final value. Asian options and lookback options are examples of path-dependent  
derivatives. As explained in Chapter 26, the payoff from an Asian option depends on the average price of the underlying asset; the payoff from a lookback option depends on  
its maximum or minimum price. One approach to valuing path-dependent options when analytic results are not available is Monte Carlo simulation, as discussed in  
Chapter 21. A sample value of the derivative can be calculated by sampling a random  
path for the underlying asset in a risk-neutral world, calculating the payoff, and  
discounting the payoff at the risk-free interest rate. An estimate of the value of the derivative is found by obtaining many sample values of the derivative in this way and calculating their mean.
The main problem with Monte Carlo simulation is that the computation time  
necessary to achieve the required level of accuracy can be unacceptably high. Also, American-style path-dependent derivatives (i.e., path-dependent derivatives where one  
side has exercise opportunities or other decisions to make) cannot easily be handled. In  
M27_HULL0654_11_GE_C27.indd   653 30/04/2021   17:45654 CHAPTER 27
this section, we show how the binomial tree methods presented in Chapter 21 can be 
extended to cope with some path-dependent derivatives.23 The procedure can handle 
American-style path-dependent derivatives and is computationally more efficient than Monte Carlo simulation for European-style path-dependent derivatives.
For the procedure to work, two conditions must be satisfied:
1. The payoff from the derivative must depend on a single function, F, of the path followed by the underlying asset.
2. It must be possible to calculate the value of F at time 
t+∆t from the value of F 
at time t and the value of the underlying asset at time t+∆t.
First we construct a tree for the underlying asset’s price in the usual way. The next 
step is to work forward through the tree establishing the maximum and minimum  
values of the path function at each node. Because the value of the path function at time 
t+∆t depends only on the value of the path function at time t and the value of  
the underlying variable at time t+∆t, the maximum and minimum values of the path 
function for the nodes at time t+∆t can be calculated in a straightforward way from 
those for the nodes at time t. The second stage is to choose representative values of the  
path function at each node. There are a number of approaches. A simple rule is to choose the representative values as the maximum value, the minimum value, and a  
number of other values that are equally spaced between the maximum and the  
minimum. As we roll back through the tree, we value the derivative for each of the representative values of the path function. When the value of the derivative is needed for other values of the path function, it is calculated by interpolation.
To illustrate the nature of the calculation, consider the problem of valuing the  
average price call option in Example 26.3 of Section 26.13 when the payoff depends  
on the arithmetic average stock price. The initial stock price is 50, the strike price is 50,  
the risk-free interest rate is 10%, the stock price volatility is 40%, and the time to  
maturity is 1 year. For 20 time steps, the binomial tree parameters are 
∆t=0.05,  
u=1.0936, d=0.9144, p=0.5056, and 1-p=0.4944. The path function is the 
arithmetic average of the stock price.
Figure 27.3 shows the calculations that are carried out in one small part of the tree. 
Node X is the central node at time 0.2 year (at the end of the fourth time step). Nodes Y  
and Z are the two nodes at time 0.25 year that are reachable from node X. The stock price at node X is 50. Forward induction shows that the maximum average stock price that is achievable in reaching node X is 53.83. The minimum is 46.65. (The initial and final stock prices are included when calculating the average.) From node X, the tree branches to one of the two nodes Y and Z. At node Y, the stock price is 54.68 and the bounds for the average are 47.99 and 57.39. At node Z, the stock price is 45.72 and the bounds for the average stock price are 43.88 and 52.48.
Suppose that the representative values of the average are chosen to be four equally 
spaced values at each node. This means that, at node X, averages of 46.65, 49.04, 51.44,  
and 53.83 are considered; at node Y, averages 47.99, 51.12, 54.26, and 57.39 are  
considered; and at node Z, averages 43.88, 46.75, 49.61, and 52.48 are considered. Assume that backward induction has already been used to calculate the value of the option for each of the alternative values of the average at nodes Y and Z. Values are 
23  This approach was suggested in J. C. Hull and A. White, “Efficient Procedures for Valuing European and 
American Path-Dependent Options,” Journal of Derivatives, 1, 1 (Fall 1993): 21–31.

shown in Figure 27.3 (e.g., at node Y when the average is 51.12, the value of the option 
is 8.101).
Consider the calculations at node X for the case where the average is 51.44. If the 
stock price moves up to node Y, the new average will be
5*51.44+54.68
6=51.98
The value of the derivative at node Y for this average can be found by interpolating between the values when the average is 51.12 and when it is 54.26. It is
151.98-51.122*8.635+154.26-51.982*8.101
54.26-51.12=8.247
Similarly, if the stock price moves down to node Z, the new average will be
5*51.44+45.72
6=50.49
and by interpolation the value of the derivative is 4.182.
The value of the derivative at node X when the average is 51.44 is, therefore,
10.5056*8.247+0.4944*4.1822e-0.1*0.05=6.206
The other values at node X are calculated similarly. Once the values at all nodes at  
time 0.2 year have been calculated, the nodes at time 0.15 year can be considered.
The value given by the full tree for the option at time zero is 7.17. As the number of 
time steps and the number of averages considered at each node is increased, the value of  
the option converges to the correct answer. With 60 time steps and 100 averages at each node, the value of the option is 5.58. The analytic approximation for the value of the option, as calculated in Example 26.3, with continuous averaging is 5.62.XY

A key advantage of the method described here is that it can handle American 
options. The calculations are as we have described them except that we test for early 
exercise at each node for each of the alternative values of the path function at the  
node. (In practice, the early exercise decision is liable to depend on both the value of  
the path function and the value of the underlying asset.) Consider the American  
version of the average price call considered here. The value calculated using the 20-step tree and four averages at each node is 7.77; with 60 time steps and 100 averages, the value is 6.17.
The approach just described can be used in a range of different situations. The two 
conditions that must be satisfied were listed at the beginning of this section. Efficiency is  
improved somewhat if quadratic rather than linear interpolation is used at each node.
27.6 BARRIER OPTIONS
Chapter 26 presented analytic results for standard barrier options. This section con-siders numerical procedures that can be used for barrier options when there are no analytic results.
In principle, many barrier options can be valued using the binomial and trinomial 
trees discussed in Chapter 21. Consider an up-and-out option. A simple approach is to  
value this in the same way as a regular option except that, when a node above the  
barrier is encountered, the value of the option is set equal to zero.
Trinomial trees work better than binomial trees, but even for them convergence is 
very slow when the simple approach is used. A large number of time steps are required to obtain a reasonably accurate result. The reason for this is that the barrier being assumed by the tree is different from the true barrier.
24 Define the inner barrier as the 
barrier formed by nodes just on the inside of the true barrier (i.e., closer to the center of  
the tree) and the outer barrier as the barrier formed by nodes just outside the true barrier (i.e., farther away from the center of the tree). Figure 27.4 shows the inner and 
outer barrier for a trinomial tree on the assumption that the true barrier is horizontal. The usual tree calculations implicitly assume that the outer barrier is the true barrier because the barrier conditions are first used at nodes on this barrier. When the time step is 
∆t, the vertical spacing between the nodes is of order 2∆t. This means that errors 
created by the difference between the true barrier and the outer barrier also tend to be  
of order 2∆t.
One approach to overcoming this problem is to:
1. Calculate the price of the derivative on the assumption that the inner barrier is the  
true barrier.
2. Calculate the value of the derivative on the assumption that the outer barrier is the  
true barrier.
3. Interpolate between the two prices.
Another approach is to ensure that nodes lie on the barrier. Suppose that the initial stock price is 
S0 and that the barrier is at H. In a trinomial tree, there are three possible 
24  For a discussion of this, see P. P. Boyle and S. H. Lau, “Bumping Up Against the Barrier with the  
Binomial Method,” Journal of Derivatives, 1, 4 (Summer 1994): 6–14.
M27_HULL0654_11_GE_C27.indd   656 30/04/2021   17:45More on Models and Numerical Procedures 657
movements in the asset’s price at each node: up by a proportional amount u; stay the 
same; and down by a proportional amount d, where d=1>u. We can always choose u 
so that nodes lie on the barrier. The condition that must be satisfied by u is
H=S0uN
or
ln H=ln S0+N ln u
for some positive or negative N.
When discussing trinomial trees in Section 21.4, the value suggested for u was es23∆t, 
so that ln u=s23∆t. In the situation considered here, a good rule is to choose ln u as  
close as possible to this value, consistent with the condition given above. This means that
ln u=ln H-ln S0
N
where
N=intcln H-ln S0
s23∆t+0.5d
and int1x2 is the integral part of x.
This leads to a tree of the form shown in Figure 27.5. The probabilities pu, pm, and 
pd on the upper, middle, and lower branches of the tree are chosen to match the first Outer barrier

The methods presented so far work reasonably well when the initial asset price is not 
close to the barrier. When the initial asset price is close to a barrier, the adaptive mesh model, which was introduced in Section 21.4, can be used.
25 The idea behind the model 
is that computational efficiency can be improved by grafting a fine tree onto a coarse tree to achieve a more detailed modeling of the asset price in the regions of the tree where it is needed most. To value a barrier option, it is computationally efficient to have a fine tree close to barriers with nodes on the barriers.

27.7 OPTIONS ON TWO CORRELATED ASSETS
Another tricky numerical problem is that of valuing American options dependent on two assets whose prices are correlated. A number of alternative approaches have been suggested. This section will explain three of these.
M27_HULL0654_11_GE_C27.indd   658 30/04/2021   17:45More on Models and Numerical Procedures 659
Transforming Variables
It is relatively easy to construct a tree in three dimensions to represent the movements  
of two uncorrelated variables. The procedure is as follows. First, construct a two- 
dimensional tree for each variable, and then combine these trees into a single three- dimensional tree. The probabilities on the branches of the three-dimensional tree are the product of the corresponding probabilities on the two-dimensional trees. Suppose, for example, that the variables are stock prices, 
S1 and S2. Each can be represented in 
two dimensions by a Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein binomial tree. Assume that S1 has a 
probability p1 of moving up by a proportional amount u1 and a probability 1-p1 of  
moving down by a proportional amount d1. Suppose further that S2 has a  
probability p2 of moving up by a proportional amount u2 and a probability 1-p2  
of moving down by a proportional amount d2. In the three-dimensional tree there are 
four branches emanating from each node. The probabilities are:
p1p2: S1 increases; S2 increases
p111-p22: S1 increases; S2 decreases
11-p12p2: S1 decreases; S2 increases
  11-p1211-p22: S1 decreases; S2 decreases
Consider next the situation where S1 and S2 are correlated. Suppose that the risk- 
neutral processes are:
dS1=1r-q12S1 dt+s1S1 dz1
dS2=1r-q22S2 dt+s2S2 dz2
and the instantaneous correlation between the Wiener processes, dz1 and dz2, is r. This 
means that
d ln S1=1r-q1-s2
1>22 dt+s1 dz1
d ln S2=1r-q2-s2
2>22 dt+s2 dz2
Two new uncorrelated variables can be defined:26
x1=s2 ln S1+s1 ln S2
x2=s2 ln S1-s1 ln S2
These variables follow the processes
 dx1=3s21r-q1-s2
1>22+s11r-q2-s22>224 dt+s1s22211+r2 dzA
 dx2=3s21r-q1-s2
1>22-s11r-q2-s22>224 dt+s1s22211-r2 dzB
where dzA and dzB are uncorrelated Wiener processes.
The variables x1 and x2 can be modeled using two separate binomial trees. In time ∆t,  
xi has a probability pi of increasing by hi and a probability 1-pi of decreasing by hi .  
The variables hi and pi are chosen so that the tree gives correct values for the first two 
moments of the distribution of x1 and x2. Because they are uncorrelated, the two trees  
can be combined into a single three-dimensional tree, as already described. At each  
26  This idea was suggested in J. C. Hull and A. White, “Valuing Derivative Securities Using the Explicit 
Finite Difference Method,” Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 25 (1990): 87–100.

node of the tree, S1 and S2 can be calculated from x1 and x2 using the inverse  
relationships
S1=expcx1+x2
2s2d and S2=expcx1-x2
2s1d
The procedure for rolling back through a three-dimensional tree to value a derivative is  
analogous to that for a two-dimensional tree.
Using a Nonrectangular Tree
Rubinstein has suggested a way of building a three-dimensional tree for two correlated  
stock prices by using a nonrectangular arrangement of the nodes.27 From a  
node 1S1, S22, where the first stock price is S1 and the second stock price is S2, there  
is a 0.25 chance of moving to each of the following:
1S1u1, S2A2, 1S1u1, S2B2, 1S1d1, S2C2, 1S1d1, S2D2
where
 u1=exp31r-q1-s2
1>22 ∆t+s12∆t4
 d1=exp31r-q1-s2
1>22 ∆t-s12∆t4
and
 A=exp31r-q2-s2
2>22∆t+s22∆t1r+21-r224
 B=exp31r-q2-s2
2>22∆t+s22∆t1r-21-r224
 C=exp31r-q2-s2
2>22∆t-s22∆t1r-21-r224
 D=exp31r-q2-s2
2>22∆t-s22∆t1r+21-r224
When the correlation is zero, this method is equivalent to constructing separate trees for  
S1 and S2 using the alternative binomial tree construction method in Section 21.4.
Adjusting the Probabilities
A third approach to building a three-dimensional tree for S1 and S2 involves first  
assuming no correlation and then adjusting the probabilities at each node to reflect the 
correlation.28 The alternative binomial tree construction method for each of S1 and S2 in  
Section 21.4 is used. This method has the property that all probabilities are 0.5. When the  
two binomial trees are combined on the assumption that there is no correlation, the  
probabilities are as shown in Table 27.2. When the probabilities are adjusted to reflect the  
correlation, they become those shown in Table 27.3.
27  See M. Rubinstein, “Return to Oz,” Risk, November (1994): 67–70.
28  This approach was suggested in the context of interest rate trees in J. C. Hull and A. White, “Numerical 
Procedures for Implementing Term Structure Models II: Two-Factor Models,” Journal of Derivatives, Winter  
(1994): 37–48.27.8 MONTE CARLO SIMULATION AND AMERICAN OPTIONS
Monte Carlo simulation is well suited to valuing path-dependent options and options where there are many stochastic variables. Trees and finite difference methods are well  
M27_HULL0654_11_GE_C27.indd   660 30/04/2021   17:45More on Models and Numerical Procedures 661
suited to valuing American-style options. What happens if an option is both path 
dependent and American? What happens if an American option depends on several stochastic variables? Section 27.5 explained a way in which the binomial tree approach can be modified to value path-dependent options in some situations. A number of researchers have adopted a different approach by searching for a way in which Monte Carlo simulation can be used to value American-style options.
29 This section explains 
two alternative ways of proceeding.
The Least-Squares Approach
In order to value an American-style option it is necessary to choose between exercising and continuing at each early exercise point. The value of exercising is normally easy to determine. A number of researchers including Longstaff and Schwartz provide a way of  Table 27.3  Combination of binomials assuming 
correlation of r.

determining the value of continuing when Monte Carlo simulation is used.30 Their 
approach involves using a least-squares analysis to determine the best-fit relationship 
between the value of continuing and the values of relevant variables at each time an early exercise decision has to be made. The approach is best illustrated with a numerical example. We use the one in the Longstaff–Schwartz paper.
Consider a 3-year American put option on a non-dividend-paying stock that can be 
exercised at the end of year 1, the end of year 2, and the end of year 3. The risk-free rate is 6% per annum (continuously compounded). The current stock price is 1.00 and the strike price is 1.10. Assume that the eight paths shown in Table 27.4 are sampled for the stock price. (This example is for illustration only; in practice many more paths would be sampled.) If the option can be exercised only at the 3-year point, it provides a cash flow 
equal to its intrinsic value at that point. This is shown in the last column of Table 27.5.
If the put option is in the money at the 2-year point, the option holder must decide 
whether to exercise. Table 27.4 shows that the option is in the money at the 2-year point 
for paths 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7. For these paths, we assume an approximate relationship:
V=a+bS+cS2
where S is the stock price at the 2-year point and V is the value of continuing,  
discounted back to the 2-year point. Our five observations on S are: 1.08, 1.07, 0.97,  
0.77, and 0.84. From Table 27.5 the corresponding values for V are: 0.00, 0.07e-0.06*1, 
0.18e-0.06*1, 0.20e-0.06*1, and 0.09e-0.06*1. The values of a, b, and c that minimize
a5
i=11Vi-a-bSi-cS2
i22
where Si and Vi are the ith observation on S and V, respectively, are a=-1.070, 
b=2.983 and c=-1.813, so that the best-fit relationship is
V=-1.070+2.983S-1.813S2
This gives the value at the 2-year point of continuing for paths 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7 of 0.0369, 
0.0461, 0.1176, 0.1520, and 0.1565, respectively. From Table 27.4 the value of exercising Table 27.5  Cash flows if exercise only possible at 3-year point.

is 0.02, 0.03, 0.13, 0.33, and 0.26. This means that we should exercise at the 2-year point 
for paths 4, 6, and 7. Table 27.6 summarizes the cash flows assuming exercise at either the 2-year point or the 3-year point for the eight paths.
Consider next the paths that are in the money at the 1-year point. These are paths 1,  
4, 6, 7, and 8. From Table 27.4 the values of S for the paths are 1.09, 0.93, 0.76, 0.92,  
and 0.88, respectively. From Table 27.6, the corresponding continuation values  
discounted back to 
t=1 are 0.00, 0.13e-0.06*1, 0.33e-0.06*1, 0.26e-0.06*1, and 0.00, 
respectively. The least-squares relationship is

This gives the value of continuing at the 1-year point for paths 1, 4, 6, 7, 8 as 0.0139, 0.1092, 0.2866, 0.1175, and 0.1533, respectively. From Table 27.4 the value of exercising is 0.01, 0.17, 0.34, 0.18, and 0.22, respectively. This means that we should exercise at the  
1-year point for paths 4, 6, 7, and 8. Table 27.7 summarizes the cash flows assuming  
that early exercise is possible at all three times. The value of the option is determined by  
discounting each cash flow back to time zero at the risk-free rate and calculating the mean of the results. It is

Since this is greater than 0.10, it is not optimal to exercise the option immediately.Table 27.6  Cash flows if exercise only possible at 2- and 3-year point.

This method can be extended in a number of ways. If the option can be exercised at  
any time we can approximate its value by considering a large number of exercise points 
(just as a binomial tree does). The relationship between V and S can be assumed to be  
more complicated. For example we could assume that V is a cubic rather than a  
quadratic function of S. The method can be used where the early exercise decision depends on several state variables. A functional form for the relationship between V and the variables is assumed and the parameters are estimated using the least-squares approach, as in the example just considered.
The Exercise Boundary Parameterization Approach
A number of researchers, such as Andersen, have proposed an alternative approach where the early exercise boundary is parameterized and the optimal values of the parameters are determined iteratively by starting at the end of the life of the option and working backward.
31 To illustrate the approach, we continue with the put option 
example and assume that the eight paths shown in Table 27.4 have been sampled. In 
this case, the early exercise boundary at time t can be parameterized by a critical value of 
S, S*1t2. If the asset price at time t is below S*1t2 we exercise at time t; if it is above 
S*1t2 we do not exercise at time t. The value of S*132 is 1.10. If the stock price is above 
1.10 when t=3 (the end of the option’s life) we do not exercise; if it is below 1.10 we 
exercise. We now consider the determination of S*122.
Suppose that we choose a value of S*122 less than 0.77. The option is not exercised at 
the 2-year point for any of the paths. The value of the option at the 2-year point for the eight paths is then 0.00, 0.00, 
0.07e-0.06*1, 0.18e-0.06*1, 0.00, 0.20e-0.06*1, 0.09e-0.06*1, 
and 0.00, respectively. The average of these is 0.0636. Suppose next that S*122=0.77.  
The value of the option at the 2-year point for the eight paths is then 0.00, 0.00, 
0.07e-0.06*1, 0.18e-0.06*1, 0.00, 0.33, 0.09e-0.06*1, and 0.00, respectively. The average  
of these is 0.0813. Similarly when S*122 equals 0.84, 0.97, 1.07, and 1.08, the average 
value of the option at the 2-year point is 0.1032, 0.0982, 0.0938, and 0.0963, respectively.  
This analysis shows that the optimal value of S*122 (i.e., the one that maximizes the  
average value of the option) is 0.84. (More precisely, it is optimal to choose 
0.84…S*12260.97.) When we choose this optimal value for S*122, the value of the 
option at the 2-year point for the eight paths is 0.00, 0.00, 0.0659, 0.1695, 0.00, 0.33, 0.26, and 0.00, respectively. The average value is 0.1032.
We now move on to calculate 
S*112. If S*11260.76 the option is not exercised at the  
1-year point for any of the paths and the value at the option at the 1-year point is 
0.1032e-0.06*1=0.0972. If S*112=0.76, the value of the option for each of the eight  
paths at the 1-year point is 0.00, 0.00, 0.0659e-0.06*1, 0.1695e-0.06*1, 0.0, 0.34,  
0.26e-0.06*1, and 0.00, respectively. The average value of the option is 0.1008. Similarly 
when S*112 equals 0.88, 0.92, 0.93, and 1.09 the average value of the option is 0.1283, 
0.1202, 0.1215, and 0.1228, respectively. The analysis therefore shows that the optimal value of 
S*112 is 0.88. (More precisely, it is optimal to choose 0.88…S*11260.92.) The  
value of the option at time zero with no early exercise is 0.1283e-0.06*1=0.1208. This is  
greater than the value of 0.10 obtained by exercising at time zero.
In practice, tens of thousands of simulations are carried out to determine the early 
exercise boundary in the way we have described. Once the early exercise boundary has

been obtained, the paths for the variables are discarded and a new Monte Carlo  
simulation using the early exercise boundary is carried out to value the option. Our 
American put option example is simple in that we know that the early exercise  
boundary at a time can be defined entirely in terms of the value of the stock price at that time. In more complicated situations it is necessary to make assumptions about how the early exercise boundary should be parameterized.
Upper Bounds
The two approaches we have outlined tend to underprice American-style options because they assume a suboptimal early exercise boundary. This has led Andersen and Broadie to propose a procedure that provides an upper bound to the price.
32 This 
procedure can be used in conjunction with any algorithm that generates a lower bound and pinpoints the true value of an American-style option more precisely than the  
algorithm does by itself.
SUMMARY
A number of models have been developed to fit the volatility smiles that are observed in  
practice. The constant elasticity of variance model leads to a volatility smile similar to that  
observed for equity options. The jump–diffusion model leads to a volatility smile similar to that observed for currency options. Variance-gamma and stochastic volatility models are more flexible in that they can lead to either the type of volatility smile observed for  
equity options or the type of volatility smile observed for currency options. The implied volatility function model provides even more flexibility than this. It is designed to provide  
an exact fit to any pattern of European option prices observed in the market.
The natural technique to use for valuing path-dependent options is Monte Carlo 
simulation. This has the disadvantage that it is fairly slow and unable to handle  
American-style derivatives easily. Luckily, trees can be used to value many types of path-dependent derivatives. The approach is to choose representative values for the underlying path function at each node of the tree and calculate the value of the derivative  
for each of these values as we roll back through the tree.
The binomial tree methodology can be extended to value convertible bonds. Extra 
branches corresponding to a default by the company are added to the tree. The roll-back calculations then reflect the holder’s option to convert and the issuer’s option to call.
Trees can be used to value many types of barrier options, but the convergence of the 
option value to the correct value as the number of time steps is increased tends to be slow. One approach for improving convergence is to arrange the geometry of the tree so  
that nodes always lie on the barriers. Another is to use an interpolation scheme to  
adjust for the fact that the barrier being assumed by the tree is different from the true  
barrier. A third is to design the tree so that it provides a finer representation of  
movements in the underlying asset price near the barrier.
One way of valuing options dependent on the prices of two correlated assets is to 
apply a transformation to the asset price to create two new uncorrelated variables. 
32 See L. B. G. Andersen and M. Broadie, “A Primal-Dual Simulation Algorithm for Pricing Multi- 
Dimensional American Options,” Management Science, 50, 9 (2004), 1222–34.
M27_HULL0654_11_GE_C27.indd   665 30/04/2021   17:45666 CHAPTER 27
These two variables are each modeled with trees and the trees are then combined to  
form a single three-dimensional tree. At each node of the tree, the inverse of the  
transformation gives the asset prices. A second approach is to arrange the positions  
of nodes on the three-dimensional tree to reflect the correlation. A third approach is to 
start with a tree that assumes no correlation between the variables and then adjust the probabilities on the tree to reflect the correlation.
Monte Carlo simulation is not naturally suited to valuing American-style options, but  
there are two ways it can be adapted to handle them. The first uses a least-squares analysis  
to relate the value of continuing (i.e, not exercising) to the values of relevant variables. The second involves parameterizing the early exercise boundary and determining it iteratively by working back from the end of the life of the option to the beginning.

 27.19. A new European-style floating lookback call option on a stock index has a maturity of 9  
months. The current level of the index is 400, the risk-free rate is 6% per annum, the

Assume that the domestic and foreign risk-free rates are 5% per annum and the current  
exchange rate is 1.00. Consider a bull spread that consists of a long position in a

volatility of 20%), and T=1. Show how the volatility smile varies with r for (a) v=0.6 
and (b) v=1.2. Consider value of r equal to 0.4, 0.2, 0, -0.2, -0.4 and values of the 
strike price equal to 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0.
 27.24. A 3-year convertible bond with a face value of $100 has been issued by company ABC. It  
pays a coupon of $5 at the end of each year. It can be converted into ABC’s equity at the  
end of the first year or at the end of the second year. At the end of the first year, it can be  
exchanged for 3.6 shares immediately after the coupon date. At the end of the second 
year, it can be exchanged for 3.5 shares immediately after the coupon date. The current stock price is $25 and the stock price volatility conditional on no default is 25%. No  
dividends are paid on the stock. The risk-free interest rate is 5% with continuous  
compounding. The yield on bonds issued by ABC is 7% with continuous compounding and the recovery rate is 30%.
(a) Use a three-step tree to calculate the value of the bond.
(b) How much is the conversion option worth?
(c) What difference does it make to the value of the bond if the bond is callable for $115 
immediately before the coupon payment at the end of years 1 and 2?
(d) Explain how your analysis would change if there were a dividend payment of $1 on the equity at the 6-month, 18-month, and 30-month points. Detailed calculations are not required.
(Hint: Use equation (24.2) to estimate the average hazard rate.)
 27.25. Show that, if there is no recovery from the bond in the event of default, a convertible 
bond can be valued by assuming that (a) both the expected return and discount rate are 
r+l and (b) there is no chance of default.

Martingales and 
Measures
Up to now interest rates have been assumed to be constant when valuing options. In 
this chapter, this assumption is relaxed in preparation for valuing interest rate deriva-tives in Chapters 29 to 34.
The risk-neutral valuation principle states that a derivative can be valued by (a) cal-
culating the expected payoff on the assumption that the expected return from the  
underlying asset equals the risk-free interest rate and (b) discounting the expected payoff   
at the risk-free interest rate. When interest rates are constant, risk-neutral valuation provides a well-defined and unambiguous valuation tool. When interest rates are  
stochastic, it is less clear-cut. What does it mean to assume that the expected return  
on the underlying asset equals to the risk-free rate? Does it mean (a) that each day the expected return is the one-day risk-free rate, or (b) that each year the expected return is  
the 1-year risk-free rate, or (c) that over a 5-year period the expected return is the 5-year  
rate at the beginning of the period? What does it mean to discount expected payoffs at the risk-free rate? Can we, for example, discount an expected payoff realized in year 5 at  
today’s 5-year risk-free rate?
In this chapter we explain the theoretical underpinnings of risk-neutral valuation 
when interest rates are stochastic and show that there are many different risk-neutral worlds that can be assumed in any given situation. We first define a parameter known as the market price of risk and show that the excess return over the risk-free interest rate 
earned by any derivative in a short period of time is linearly related to the market prices of risk of the underlying stochastic variables. What we will refer to as the traditional risk-neutral world assumes that all market prices of risk are zero, but we will find that other assumptions about the market price of risk are useful in some situations.
Martingales and measures are critical to a full understanding of risk neutral valua-
tion. A martingale is a zero-drift stochastic process. A measure is the unit in which we  
value security prices. A key result in this chapter will be the equivalent martingale  
measure result. This states that if we use the price of a traded security as the unit of measurement then there is a market price of risk for which all security prices follow martingales.
This chapter illustrates the power of the equivalent martingale measure result by using  
it to extend Black’s model (see Section 18.7) to the situation where interest rates are stochastic and to value options to exchange one asset for another. Chapter 29 uses the result to understand the standard market models for valuing interest rate derivatives, 28 CHAPTER  
M28_HULL0654_11_GE_C28.indd   670 30/04/2021   17:46Martingales and Measures 671
We start by considering the properties of derivatives dependent on the value of a single 
variable u. Assume that the process followed by u is
 du
u=m dt+s dz (28.1)
where dz is a Wiener process. The parameters m and s are the expected growth rate in u  
and the volatility of u, respectively. We assume that they depend only on u and time t. 
The variable u need not be the price of an investment asset. It could be something as far  
removed from financial markets as the temperature in the center of New Orleans.
Suppose that f1 and f2 are the prices of two derivatives dependent only on u and t. 
These can be options or other instruments that provide a payoff in the future equal to some function of 
u. Assume that during the time period under consideration f1 and f2 
provide no income.1
Suppose that the processes followed by f1 and f2 are
d f1
f1=m1 dt+s1 dz
and
d f2
f2=m2 dt+s2 dz
where m1, m2, s1, and s2 are functions of u and t. The “dz” in these processes must be 
the same dz as in equation (28.1) because it is the only source of the uncertainty in the prices of 
f1 and f2.
The prices f1 and f2 can be related using an analysis similar to the Black–Scholes 
analysis described in Section 15.6. The discrete versions of the processes for f1 and f2 are
 ∆f1=m1f1 ∆t+s1f1 ∆z (28.2)
 ∆f2=m2f2 ∆t+s2f2 ∆z (28.3)
We can eliminate the ∆z by forming an instantaneously riskless portfolio consisting of 
s2f2 of the first derivative and -s1f1 of the second derivative. If Π is the value of the 
portfolio, then
 Π=1s2f22f1-1s1f12f2 (28.4)
and
 ∆Π=s2f2 ∆f1-s1f1 ∆f2
Substituting from equations (28.2) and (28.3), this becomes
 ∆Π=1m1s2f1f2-m2s1f1f22∆t (28.5)Chapter 30 uses it to value some nonstandard derivatives, and Chapter 33 uses it to 
develop the LIBOR market model.
1  The analysis can be extended to derivatives that provide income (see Problem 28.7).28.1 THE MARKET PRICE OF RISK
M28_HULL0654_11_GE_C28.indd   671 30/04/2021   17:46672 CHAPTER 28
Because the portfolio is instantaneously riskless, it must earn the risk-free rate. Hence,
∆Π=rΠ ∆t
Substituting into this equation from equations (28.4) and (28.5) gives
m1s2-m2s1=rs2-rs1
or
 m1-r
s1=m2-r
s2 (28.6)
Note that the left-hand side of equation (28.6) depends only on the parameters of the 
process followed by f1 and the right-hand side depends only on the parameters of the 
process followed by f2. Define l as the value of each side in equation (28.6), so that
m1-r
s1=m2-r
s2=l
Dropping subscripts, equation (28.6) shows that if f is the price of a derivative dependent  
only on u and t with
 d f
f=m dt+s dz (28.7)
then
 m-r
s=l (28.8)
The parameter l is known as the market price of risk of u. (In the context of portfolio 
performance measurement, it is known as the Sharpe ratio.) It can be dependent on 
both u and t, but it is not dependent on the nature of the derivative f. Our analysis  
shows that, for no arbitrage, 1m-r2>s must at any given time be the same for all 
derivatives that are dependent only on u and t.
The market price of risk of u measures the trade-offs between risk and return that are  
made for securities dependent on u. Equation (28.8) can be written
 m-r=ls (28.9)
The variable s can be loosely interpreted as the quantity of u-risk present in f. On the  
right-hand side of the equation, the quantity of u-risk is multiplied by the price of  
u-risk. The left-hand side is the expected return, in excess of the risk-free interest rate, 
that is required to compensate for this risk. Equation (28.9) is analogous to the capital asset pricing model, which relates the expected excess return on a stock to its risk. This chapter will not be concerned with the measurement of the market price of risk. This will be discussed in Chapter 36 when the evaluation of real options is considered.
It is natural to assume that 
s, the coefficient of dz, in equation (28.7) is the volatility 
of f. In fact, s can be negative. This will be the case when f is negatively related to u  
(so that 0f>0u is negative). It is the absolute value ∙s∙ of s that is the volatility of f. One  
way of understanding this is to note that the process for f has the same statistical  
properties when we replace dz by -dz.
Chapter 5 distinguished between investment assets and consumption assets. An 
investment asset is an asset that is bought or sold purely for investment purposes by some investors. Consumption assets are held primarily for consumption. Equation (28.8)  
M28_HULL0654_11_GE_C28.indd   672 30/04/2021   17:46Martingales and Measures 673
is true for all investment assets that provide no income and depend only on u. If the 
variable u itself happens to be such an asset, then
m-r
s=l
But, in other circumstances, this relationship is not necessarily true.
Example 28.1
Consider a derivative whose price is positively related to the price of oil and  
depends on no other stochastic variables. Suppose that it provides an expected 
return of 12% per annum and has a volatility of 20% per annum. Assume that the risk-free interest rate is 8% per annum. It follows that the market price of risk of oil is
0.12-0.08
0.2=0.2
Note that oil is a consumption asset rather than an investment asset, so its market price of risk cannot be calculated from equation (28.8) by setting 
m equal to the 
expected return from an investment in oil and s equal to the volatility of oil prices.
Example 28.2
Consider two securities, both of which are positively dependent on the 90-day interest rate. Suppose that the first one has an expected return of 3% per annum and a volatility of 20% per annum, and the second one has a volatility of 30% per annum. Assume that the instantaneous risk-free rate of interest is 6% per annum. The market price of interest rate risk is, using the expected return and volatility for the first security,
0.03-0.06
0.2=-0.15
From a rearrangement of equation (28.9), the expected return from the second security is, therefore,
0.06-0.15*0.3=0.015
or 1.5% per annum.
Alternative Worlds
The process followed by derivative price f is
d f=m f dt+s f dz
The value of m depends on the risk preferences of investors. In a world where the  
market price of risk is zero, l equals zero. From equation (28.9) m=r, so that the 
process followed by f is
d f=r f dt+s f dz
We will refer to this as the traditional risk-neutral world.
Other assumptions about the market price of risk, l, enable other worlds that are 
internally consistent to be defined. From equation (28.9),
m=r+ls
M28_HULL0654_11_GE_C28.indd   673 30/04/2021   17:46674 CHAPTER 28
so that
 d f=1r+ls2 f dt+s f dz (28.10)
The market price of risk of a variable determines the growth rates of all securities 
dependent on the variable. As we move from one market price of risk to another, the expected growth rates of security prices change, but their volatilities remain the same. This is Girsanov’s theorem, which we illustrated for the binomial model in Section 13.7. Choosing a particular market price of risk is also referred to as defining the probability measure. Some value of the market price of risk corresponds to the “real world” and the growth rates of security prices that are observed in practice.
28.2 SEVERAL STATE VARIABLES
Suppose that n variables, u1, u2, c, un, follow stochastic processes of the form
 dui
ui=mi dt+si dzi (28.11)
for i=1, 2, c, n, where the dzi are Wiener processes. The parameters mi and si are  
expected growth rates and volatilities and may be functions of the ui and time.  
Equation (14A.10) in the appendix to Chapter 14 provides a version of Itô’s lemma that covers functions of several variables. It shows that the process for the price f of a security that is dependent on the 
ui has n stochastic components. It can be written
 d f
f=m dt+an
i=1si dzi (28.12)
In this equation, m is the expected return from the security and si dzi is the component 
of the risk of this return attributable to ui. Both m and the si are potentially dependent 
on the ui and time.
Technical Note 30 at www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/∼hull/TechnicalNotes shows that
 m-r=an
i=1lisi (28.13)
where li is the market price of risk for ui. This equation relates the expected excess return  
that investors require on the security to the li and si. Equation (28.9) is the particular  
case of this equation when n=1. The term lisi on the right-hand side measures the 
extent that the excess return required by investors on a security is affected by the dependence of the security on 
ui. If lisi=0, there is no effect; if lisi70, investors 
require a higher return to compensate them for the risk arising from ui; if lisi60, the 
dependence of the security on ui causes investors to require a lower return than would 
otherwise be the case. The lisi60 situation occurs when the variable has the effect of 
reducing rather than increasing the risks in the portfolio of a typical investor.
Example 28.3
A stock price depends on three underlying variables: the price of oil, the price of 
gold, and the performance of a stock index. Suppose that the market prices of risk for these variables are 0.2, 
-0.1, and 0.4, respectively. Suppose also that the si in 
M28_HULL0654_11_GE_C28.indd   674 30/04/2021   17:46Martingales and Measures 675
equation (28.12) corresponding to the three variables have been estimated as 0.05, 
0.1, and 0.15, respectively. The excess return on the stock over the risk-free rate is
0.2*0.05-0.1*0.1+0.4*0.15=0.06
or 6.0% per annum. If variables other than those considered affect the stock  
price, this result is still true provided that the market price of risk for each of  
these other variables is zero.
Equation (28.13) is closely related to arbitrage pricing theory, developed by Stephen 
Ross in 1976.2 The continuous-time version of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) 
can be regarded as a particular case of the equation. CAPM (see appendix to Chapter 3)  
argues that an investor requires excess returns to compensate for any risk that is  
correlated to the risk in the return from the stock market, but requires no excess return for other risks. Risks that are correlated with the return from the stock market are referred to as systematic; other risks are referred to as nonsystematic. If CAPM is true, then 
li is proportional to the correlation between changes in ui and the return from the 
market. When ui is uncorrelated with the return from the market, li is zero.
3  More formally, a sequence of random variables X0, X1, c is a martingale if E1Xi∙Xi-1, Xi-2, c, X02 =
Xi-1, for all i70, where E denotes expectation.2 See S. A. Ross, “The Arbitrage Theory of Capital Asset Pricing,” Journal of Economic Theory, 13  
(December 1976): 343–62.
4  Problem 28.8 extends the analysis to situations where the securities provide income.28.3 MARTINGALES
A martingale is a zero-drift stochastic process.3 A variable u follows a martingale if its 
process has the form
du=s dz
where dz is a Wiener process. The variable s may itself be stochastic. It can depend on u  
and other stochastic variables. A martingale has the convenient property that its expected value at any future time is equal to its value today. This means that
E1uT2=u0
where u0 and uT denote the values of u at times zero and T, respectively. To understand  
this result, note that over a very small time interval the change in u is normally  
distributed with zero mean. The expected change in u over any very small time interval 
is therefore zero. The change in u between time 0 and time T is the sum of its changes 
over many small time intervals. It follows that the expected change in u between time 0  
and time T must also be zero.
The Equivalent Martingale Measure Result
Suppose that f and g are the prices of traded securities dependent on a single source of  
uncertainty. Assume that the securities provide no income during the time period under  
consideration and define f=f>g.4 The variable f is the relative price of f with respect 
to g. It can be thought of as measuring the price of f in units of g rather than dollars. 
The security price g is referred to as the numeraire.
M28_HULL0654_11_GE_C28.indd   675 30/04/2021   17:46676 CHAPTER 28
The equivalent martingale measure result shows that, when there are no arbitrage 
opportunities, f is a martingale for some choice of the market price of risk. What is 
more, for a given numeraire security g, the same choice of the market price of risk 
makes f a martingale for all securities f. This choice of the market price of risk is the 
volatility of g. In other words, when the market price of risk is set equal to the volatility of g, the ratio 
f>g is a martingale for all security prices f. (Note that the market price  
of risk has the same dimension as volatility. Both are “per square root of time.” Setting the market price of risk equal to a volatility is therefore dimensionally valid.)
To prove this result, suppose that the volatilities of f and g are 
sf and sg and r is the  
instantaneous risk-free rate. (These variables can depend on the single source of  
uncertainty that is being assumed.) From equation (28.10), in a world where the market price of risk is 
sg,
 d f=1r+sgsf2 f dt+sf f dz
 dg=1r+s2
g2g dt+sgg dz
Using Itô’s lemma gives
 d ln f=1r+sgsf-s2
f>22 dt+sf dz
 d ln g=1r+s2
g>22 dt+sg dz
so that
d1ln f-ln g2=1sgsf-s2
f>2-s2
g>22 dt+1sf-sg2 dz
or
dalnf
gb=-1sf-sg22
2dt+1sf-sg2 dz
Itô’s lemma can be used to determine the process for f>g from the process for ln1f>g2:
 daf
gb=1sf-sg2 f
g dz (28.14)
This shows that f>g is a martingale and proves the equivalent martingale measure result.
From now on, we will use the phrase “world defined by numeraire g” to mean a world  
where sg, the volatility of g, is the market price of risk. Because f>g is a martingale in 
this world, it follows from the result at the beginning of this section that
f0
g0=Eg afT
gTb
or
 f0=g0Eg afT
gTb (28.15)
where Eg denotes the expected value in a world defined by numeraire g.
28.4 ALTERNATIVE CHOICES FOR THE NUMERAIRE
We now present a number of examples of the equivalent martingale measure result. The  
first example shows that it is consistent with the traditional risk-neutral valuation result 
used in earlier chapters. The other examples prepare the way for the valuation of bond options, interest rate caps, and swap options in Chapter 29.
M28_HULL0654_11_GE_C28.indd   676 30/04/2021   17:46Martingales and Measures 677
Money Market Account as the Numeraire
The dollar money market account is a security that is worth $1 at time zero and earns 
the instantaneous risk-free rate r at any given time.5 The variable r may be stochastic. If  
we set g equal to the money market account, it grows at rate r so that
 dg=rg dt (28.16)
The drift of g is stochastic, but the volatility of g is zero. It follows from the results in 
Section 28.3 that f>g is a martingale in a world where the market price of risk is zero. 
This is the world we defined earlier as the traditional risk-neutral world. From equa-tion ( 28.15),
 f
0=g0 En afT
gTb (28.17)
where En denotes expectations in the traditional risk-neutral world.
In this case, g0=1 and
gT=e3T
0r dt
so that equation (28.17) reduces to
 f0=En1e-3T
0r dtfT2 (28.18)
or
 f0=En1e-rT fT2 (28.19)
where r is the average value of r between time 0 and time T. This equation shows that 
one way of valuing an interest rate derivative is to simulate the short-term interest rate r  
in the traditional risk-neutral world. On each trial the payoff is calculated and  
discounted at the average value of the short rate on the sampled path.
When the short-term interest rate r is assumed to be constant, equation (28.19) 
reduces to
f0=e-rTEn1fT2
or the risk-neutral valuation relationship used in earlier chapters.
Zero-Coupon Bond Price as the Numeraire
Define P1t, T2 as the price at time t of a risk-free zero-coupon bond that pays off $1 at  
time T. We now explore the implications of setting the numeraire g equal to P1t, T2. Let 
ET denote expectations in a world defined by this numeraire. Because gT=P1T, T2=1 
and g0=P10, T2, equation (28.15) gives
 f0=P10, T2ET 1fT2 (28.20)
Notice the difference between equations (28.20) and (28.19). In equation (28.19), the 
discounting is inside the expectations operator. In equation (28.20), the discounting, as 
5  The money market account is the limit as ∆t approaches zero of the following security. For the first short 
period of time of length ∆t, it is invested at the initial ∆t period rate; at time ∆t, it is reinvested for a further 
period of time ∆t at the new ∆t period rate; at time 2∆t, it is again reinvested for a further period of time ∆t 
at the new ∆t period rate; and so on. The money market accounts in other currencies are defined analogously 
to the dollar money market account.
M28_HULL0654_11_GE_C28.indd   677 30/04/2021   17:46678 CHAPTER 28
represented by the P10, T2 term, is outside the expectations operator. The use of P1t, T2 
as the numeraire therefore considerably simplifies things for a security that provides a 
payoff solely at time T.
Consider any variable u that is not an interest rate.6 A forward contract on u with 
maturity T is defined as a contract that pays off uT-K at time T, where uT is the value u  
at time T. Define f as the value of this forward contract. From equation (28.20),
f0=P10, T23ET1uT2-K4
The forward price, F, of u is the value of K for which f0 equals zero. It therefore  
follows that
P10, T23ET1uT2-F4=0
or
 F=ET1uT2 (28.21)
Equation (28.21) shows that the forward price of any variable (except an interest rate) is  
its expected future spot price in a world defined by the numeraire P1t, T2. Note the  
difference here between forward prices and futures prices. The argument in Section 18.6  
shows that the futures price of a variable is the expected future spot price in the  
traditional risk-neutral world.
To summarize, equation (28.20) shows that any security that provides a payoff at  
time T can be valued by calculating its expected payoff in a world defined by the 
numeraire that is a bond maturing at time T and discounting at the current risk-free rate  
for maturity T. Equation (28.21) shows that it is correct to assume that the expected 
value of the underlying variables equal their forward values when computing the 
expected payoff.
Forward Interest Rates
For the next result, define F1t2 as the forward interest rate as seen at time t for the 
period between T and T * expressed with a compounding period of T *-T. (For  
example, if T *-T=0.5, the interest rate is expressed with semiannual compounding;  
if T *-T=0.25, it is expressed with quarterly compounding; and so on.)
Define R as the realized rate between T  and T * expressed with the same compound-  
ing frequency. From the definition of a forward interest rate, a forward rate agreement  
paying off F1t2-R at time T * is worth zero at time t. From the result in equa- 
tion (28.21), it follows that
P10, T *2ET *1F1t2-R2=0
so that
 ET *1R2=F1t2 (28.22)
Note that in this result F1t2 and R can be calculated from any yield curve. In the case of 
the risk-free yield curve calculated from overnight interest rates, R is not known until 
time T *. For other yield curves, R is known at time T. Equation (28.22) applies in both 
cases. The results we just have produced will be useful in explaining the valuation of interest rate caps and floors in the next chapter.
6  The analysis given here does not apply to interest rates because forward contracts for interest rates are 
defined slightly differently from forward contracts for other variables, as will be seen shortly.
M28_HULL0654_11_GE_C28.indd   678 30/04/2021   17:46Martingales and Measures 679
Annuity Factor as the Numeraire
For the next application of equivalent martingale measure arguments, consider a  
floating-for-fixed swap starting at a future time T  with payment dates at times T1,
T2, c, TN. In the swap, a fixed rate of interest is exchanged for the floating rate. Define  
T0=T. Assume that the notional principal is $1. Suppose that the forward swap rate 
(i.e., the interest rate on the fixed side that makes the forward swap have a value of zero)  
is s(t) at time t 1t…T2. The value of the fixed side of the swap is
s1t2A1t2
where
A1t2=aN-1
i=01Ti+1-Ti2P1t, Ti+12
Define the value of the floating side as V1t2. Equating the values of the fixed and floating  
sides gives
s1t2A1t2=V1t2
or
 s1t2=V1t2
A1t2 (28.23)
The equivalent martingale measure result can be applied by setting f equal to V1t2  
and g equal to A1t2. This leads to
 s1t2=EA3s1T24 (28.24)
where EA denotes expectations in a world that is defined by the numeraire A1t2. There-
fore, in a world defined by this numeraire, the expected future swap rate is the current 
forward swap rate.
The result in equation (28.15) shows that
 V102=A102EAcV1T2
A1T2d (28.25)
This result, when combined with the result in equation (28.24), will be critical to an understanding of the standard market model for European swap options in the next chapter. Note that in this result 
V1t2 can be calculated from any yield curve, whereas 
A1t2 is calculated from the risk-free zero curve. For example, the swap can be a LIBOR-
for-fixed swap, while the risk-free rate is calculated from the OIS zero curve.
7  The independence condition is not critical. If factors are not independent they can be orthogonalized.28.5 EXTENSION TO SEVERAL FACTORS
The results presented in Sections 28.3 and 28.4 can be extended to cover the situation  
when there are many independent factors.7 Assume that there are n independent factors  
M28_HULL0654_11_GE_C28.indd   679 30/04/2021   17:46680 CHAPTER 28
and that the processes for f and g in the traditional risk-neutral world are
d f=r f dt+an
i=1sf, i  f dzi
and
dg=rg dt+an
i=1sg, i g dzi
It follows from Section 28.2 that other internally consistent worlds can be defined by 
setting
d f=cr+an
i=1li sf, id
 f dt+an
i=1sf, i  f dzi
and
dg=cr+an
i=1li sg, id
 g dt+an
i=1sg, i g dzi
where the li 11…i…n2 are the n market prices of risk. One of these other worlds is the  
real world.
We now extend our earlier terminology. A “world defined by numeraire g” is a world 
where li=sg,i for all i. It can be shown from Itô’s lemma, using the fact that the dzi  
are uncorrelated, that the process followed by f>g in this world has zero drift (see 
Problem 28.12). The rest of the results in the last two sections (from equation (28.15) 
onward) are therefore still true.
28.6 BLACK’S MODEL REVISITED
Section 18.8 explained that Black’s model is a popular tool for pricing European  
options in terms of the forward or futures price of the underlying asset when interest  
rates are constant. We are now in a position to relax the constant interest rate  
assumption and show that Black’s model can be used to price European options in terms of the forward price of the underlying asset when interest rates are stochastic.
Consider a European call option on an asset with strike price K that lasts until time T.  
From equation (28.20), the option’s price is given by
 
c=P10, T2ET3max1ST-K, 024 (28.26)
where ST is the asset price at time T and ET denotes expectations in a world defined by 
numeraire P1t, T2. Define F0 and FT as the forward price of the asset at time 0 and time 
T for a contract maturing at time T. Because ST=FT,
c=P10, T2ET3max1FT-K, 024
Assume that FT is lognormal in the world being considered, with the standard deviation 
of ln1FT2 equal to sF2T. This could be because the forward price follows a stochastic 
process with volatility sF. Equation (15A.1) shows that
 ET3max1FT-K, 024=ET1FT2N1d12-KN1d22 (28.27)
M28_HULL0654_11_GE_C28.indd   680 30/04/2021   17:46Martingales and Measures 681
where
 d1=ln3ET1FT2>K4+s2
FT>2
sF2T
 d2=ln3ET1FT2>K4-s2
FT>2
sF2T
From equation (28.21), ET1FT2=ET1ST2=F0. Hence,
 c=P10, T23F0N1d12-K N1d224 (28.28)
where
 d1=ln3F0>K4+s2
FT>2
sF2T
 d2=ln3F0>K4-s2
FT>2
sF2T
Similarly,
 p=P10, T23K N1-d22-F0N1-d124 (28.29)
where p is the price of a European put option on the asset with strike price K and time 
to maturity T. This is Black’s model. It applies to both investment and consumption 
assets and, as we have just shown, is true when interest rates are stochastic provided that  
F0 is the forward asset price for a contract with the same maturity as the option. The 
variable sF can be interpreted as the volatility of the forward asset price.
28.7 OPTION TO EXCHANGE ONE ASSET FOR ANOTHER
Consider next an option to exchange an investment asset worth U for an investment asset worth V. This has already been discussed in Section 26.14. Suppose that the  
volatilities of U  and V  are 
sU and sV and the coefficient of correlation between them is r.
Assume first that the assets provide no income and choose the numeraire security to 
be U. Setting f=V in equation (28.15) gives
 V0=U0EU aVT
UTb (28.30)
where EU denotes expectations in a world defined by the numeraire U. (We are here 
using the multifactor extension of equation (28.15) because V and U may depend on different Wiener processes.)
The variable f in equation (28.15) can be set equal to the value of the option under 
consideration, so that 
fT=max1VT-UT, 02. It follows that
f0=U0 EUcmax1VT-UT, 02
UTd
or
 f0=U0 EUcmax aVT
UT-1, 0bd (28.31)
M28_HULL0654_11_GE_C28.indd   681 30/04/2021   17:46682 CHAPTER 28
The volatility of V>U is sn (see Problem 28.13), where
sn2=s2
U+s2V-2rsUsV
From equation (15A.1), equation (28.31) becomes
f0=U0cEU aVT
UTbN1d12-N1d22d
where
d1=ln1V0>U02+sn2T>2
sn2T and d2=d1-sn2T
Substituting from equation (28.30) gives
 f0=V0N1d12-U0N1d22 (28.32)
This is the value of an option to exchange one asset for another when the assets provide 
no income.
Problem 28.8 shows that, when f  and g  provide income at rate qf and qg, equa-
tion (28.15) becomes
f0=g0e1qf-qg2TEg afT
gTb
This means that equations (28.30) and (28.31) become
EU aVT
UTb=e1qU-qV2T V0
U0
and
f0=e-qUTU0EUcmax aVT
UT-1, 0bd
and equation (28.32) becomes
f0=e-qVTV0N1d12-e-qUTU0N1d22
with d1 and d2 being redefined as
d1=ln1V0>U02+1qU-qV+sn2>22T
sn2T and d2=d1-sn2T
This is the result given in equation (26.5) for the value of an option to exchange one asset for another.
28.8 CHANGE OF NUMERAIRE
In this section, we consider the impact of a change in numeraire on the process followed by a market variable. Suppose first that the variable is the price of a traded security, f.
M28_HULL0654_11_GE_C28.indd   682 30/04/2021   17:46Martingales and Measures 683
In a world where the market price of dzi risk is li ,
d f=cr+an
i=1lisf,id
  f dt+an
i=1sf,i f dzi
Similarly, when it is l*
i ,
d f=cr+an
i=1l*
isf, id
  f dt+an
i=1sf, i f dzi
The effect of moving from the first world to the second is therefore to increase the 
expected growth rate of the price of any traded security f by
an
i=11l*
i-li2sf,i
Consider next a variable v that is not the price of a traded security. As shown in 
Technical Note 20 at www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull/TechnicalNotes, the expected growth rate of v responds to a change in the market price of risk in the same way as the expected growth rate of the prices of traded securities. It increases by
 a
v=an
i=11l*
i-li2sv,i (28.33)
where sv,i is the ith component of the volatility of v.
When we move from a numeraire of g  to a numeraire of h , li=sg,i and l*
i=sh,i . 
Define w=h>g and sw, i as the ith component of the volatility of w. From Itô’s  
lemma (see Problem 28.13),
sw,i=sh,i-sg,i
so that equation (28.33) becomes
 av=an
i=1sw,i sv,i (28.34)
We will refer to w as the numeraire ratio. Equation (28.34) is equivalent to
 av=rsvsw (28.35)
where sv is the total volatility of v, sw is the total volatility of w, and r is the  
instantaneous correlation between changes in v and w.8
This is a surprisingly simple result. The adjustment to the expected growth rate of a  
variable v when we change from one numeraire to another is the instantaneous  
covariance between the percentage change in v and the percentage change in the 
8  To see this, note that the changes ∆v and ∆w in v and w in a short period of time ∆t are given by
 ∆v=g+asv, ivPi2∆t
 ∆w=g+asw, iwPi2∆t
Since the dzi are uncorrelated, it follows that E1Pi Pj2=0 when i≠j. Also, from the definition of r, we have
rvsvwsw=E1∆v ∆w2-E1∆v2E1∆w2
When terms of higher order than ∆t are ignored this leads to
rsvsw=asw,i sv,i
M28_HULL0654_11_GE_C28.indd   683 30/04/2021   17:46684 CHAPTER 28
numeraire ratio. This result will be used when timing and quanto adjustments are  
considered in Chapter 30.
A particular case of the results in this section is when we move from the real world to  
the traditional risk-neutral world (where all the market prices of risk are zero). From 
equation (28.33), the growth rate of v changes by -an
i=1lisv,i. This corresponds to the 
result in equation (28.13) when v is the price of a traded security. We have shown that it  
is also true when v is not the price of a traded security. In general, the way that we move from one world to another for variables that are not the prices of traded securities is the  
same as for those that are.
A Final Point
In this chapter we have expressed the processes for variables in terms of their expected returns and volatilities. The results if we use drifts and standard deviations are much the  
same. Suppose
d f=m f dt+s f dz
and we write the process as
d f=m* dt+s* dz
(so that m*=mf and s*=sf). Suppose further that these processes reflect a market  
price of risk of l1. The impact of changing the market price to l2 is, as we have  
explained, to change the process to
d f=1m+l2s-l1s2 f dt+s f dz
This is the same as
d f=1m*+l2s*-l1s*2 dt+s* dz
SUMMARY
The market price of risk of a variable defines the trade-offs between risk and return for traded securities dependent on the variable. When there is one underlying variable, a derivative’s excess return over the risk-free rate equals the market price of risk multiplied  
by the derivative’s volatility. When there are many underlying variables, the excess return  
is the sum of the market price of risk multiplied by the volatility for each variable.
A powerful tool in the valuation of derivatives is risk-neutral valuation. This was  
introduced in Chapters 13 and 15. The principle of risk-neutral valuation shows that, if  
we assume that the world is risk neutral when valuing derivatives, we get the right answer— not just in a risk-neutral world, but in all other worlds as well. In the  
traditional risk-neutral world, the market price of risk of all variables is zero. This  
chapter has extended the principle of risk-neutral valuation. It has shown that, when interest rates are stochastic, there are many interesting and useful alternatives to the traditional risk-neutral world.
A martingale is a zero drift stochastic process. Any variable following a martingale 
has the simplifying property that its expected value at any future time equals its value today. The equivalent martingale measure result shows that, if g is a security price, there is a world in which the ratio 
f>g is a martingale for all security prices f. It turns out  
that, by appropriately choosing the numeraire security g, the valuation of many interest 
rate dependent derivatives can be simplified.
M28_HULL0654_11_GE_C28.indd   684 30/04/2021   17:46Martingales and Measures 685
This chapter has used the equivalent martingale measure result to extend Black’s 
model to the situation where interest rates are stochastic and to value an option to 
exchange one asset for another. In Chapters 29 to 34, it will be useful in valuing interest rate derivatives.

Interest Rate 
Derivatives:  
The Standard 
Market Models
Interest rate derivatives are instruments whose payoffs are dependent in some way on the 
level of interest rates. Since the 1980s, the volume of trading in interest rate derivatives in  
both the over-the-counter and exchange-traded markets has increased rapidly. Many new  
products have been developed to meet particular needs of end users. A key challenge for  
derivatives traders has been to find good, robust procedures for pricing and hedging these  
products. Interest rate derivatives are more difficult to value than equity and foreign exchange derivatives for the following reasons:
1. The behavior of an individual interest rate is more complicated than that of a  
stock price or an exchange rate.
2. For the valuation of many products it is necessary to develop a model describing the behavior of the entire zero-coupon yield curve.
3. The volatilities of different points on the yield curve are different.
4. Interest rates are used for discounting the derivative as well as defining its payoff.
This chapter considers the three most popular over-the-counter interest rate option products: bond options, interest rate caps/floors, and swap options. It explains how  
the products work and the standard market models used to value them.29 CHAPTER  
29.1 BOND OPTIONS
A bond option is an option to buy or sell a particular bond by a particular date for a particular price. In addition to trading in the over-the-counter market, bond options  
are frequently embedded in bonds when they are issued to make them more attractive to  
either the issuer or potential purchasers.
Embedded Bond Options
One example of a bond with an embedded bond option is a callable bond. This is a  
bond that contains provisions allowing the issuing firm to buy back the bond at a  
M29_HULL0654_11_GE_C29.indd   688 30/04/2021   17:47Interest Rate Derivatives: The Standard Market Models 689
predetermined price at certain times in the future. The holder of such a bond has sold  
a call option to the issuer. The strike price or call price in the option is the  
predetermined price that must be paid by the issuer to the holder. Callable bonds  
cannot usually be called for the first few years of their life. (This is known as the lock-  
out period.) After that, the call price is usually a decreasing function of time. For 
example, in a 10-year callable bond, there might be no call privileges for the first  
2 years. After that, the issuer might have the right to buy the bond back at a price of 110 in years 3 and 4 of its life, at a price of 107.5 in years 5 and 6, at a price of 106 in years 7 and 8, and at a price of 103 in years 9 and 10. The value of the call option is reflected in the quoted yields on bonds. Bonds with call features generally offer higher yields than bonds with no call features.
Another type of bond with an embedded option is a puttable bond. This contains 
provisions that allow the holder to demand early redemption at a predetermined price at certain times in the future. The holder of such a bond has purchased a put option on the bond as well as the bond itself. Because the put option increases the value of the bond to the holder, bonds with put features provide lower yields than bonds with no put features. A simple example of a puttable bond is a 10-year bond where the holder has the right to be repaid at the end of 5 years. (This is sometimes referred to as a retractable bond.)
Loan and deposit instruments also often contain embedded bond options. For  
example, a 5-year fixed-rate deposit with a financial institution that can be redeemed without penalty at any time contains an American put option on a bond. (The deposit instrument is a bond that the investor has the right to put back to the financial  
institution at its face value at any time.) Prepayment privileges on loans and mortgages are similarly call options on bonds.
Finally, a loan commitment made by a bank or other financial institution is a put 
option on a bond. Consider, for example, the situation where a bank quotes a 5-year interest rate of 3% per annum to a potential borrower and states that the rate is good for the next 2 months. The client has, in effect, obtained the right to sell a 5-year bond with a 3% coupon to the financial institution for its face value any time within the next 2 months. The option will be exercised if rates increase.
European Bond Options
Many over-the-counter bond options and some embedded bond options are European.  
The assumption made in the standard market model for valuing European bond  
options is that the forward bond price has a volatility sB. This allows Black’s model  
in Section 28.6 to be used. In equations (28.28) and (28.29), sF is set equal to sB and F0 
is set equal to the forward bond price FB, so that
  c=P10, T23FBN1d12-K N1d224 (29.1)
  p=P10, T23K N1-d22-FBN1-d124 (29.2)
where
d1=ln1FB>K2+s2
BT>2
sB2T and d2=d1-sB2T
In these equations, K is the strike price of the bond option, T is its time to maturity, and 
P10, T2 is the (risk-free) discount factor for maturity T.
M29_HULL0654_11_GE_C29.indd   689 30/04/2021   17:47690 CHAPTER 29
From Section 5.5, FB can be calculated using the formula
 FB=B0-I
P10, T2 (29.3)
where B0 is the bond price at time zero and I is the present value of the coupons that  
will be paid during the life of the option. In this formula, both the spot bond price and 
the forward bond price are cash prices rather than quoted prices. The relationship between cash and quoted bond prices is explained in Section 6.1.
The strike price K in equations (29.1) and (29.2) should be the cash strike price. In  
choosing the correct value for K, the precise terms of the option are therefore  
important. If the strike price is defined as the cash amount that is exchanged for the bond when the option is exercised, K should be set equal to this strike price. If, as is  
more common, the strike price is the quoted price applicable when the option is  
exercised, K should be set equal to the strike price plus accrued interest at the expiration  
date of the option. Traders refer to the quoted price of a bond as the clean price and the  
cash price as the dirty price.
Example 29.1
Consider a 10-month European call option on a 9.75-year bond with a face  
value of $1,000. (When the option matures, the bond will have 8 years and  
11 months remaining.) Suppose that the current cash bond price is $960, the  
strike price is $l,000, the 10-month risk-free interest rate is 10% per annum, and 
the volatility of the forward bond price for a contract maturing in 10 months is  
9% per annum. The bond pays a coupon of 10% per year (with payments made semiannually). Coupon payments of $50 are expected in 3 months and 9 months. (This means that the accrued interest is $25 and the quoted bond price is $935.) We suppose that the 3-month and 9-month risk-free interest rates are 9.0% and 9.5% per annum, respectively. The present value of the coupon payments is,  
therefore,
50e-0.25*0.09+50e-0.75*0.095=95.45
or $95.45. The bond forward price is from equation (29.3) given by
FB=1960-95.452e0.1*0.8333=939.68
(a)  If the strike price is the cash price that would be paid for the bond on exercise,  
the parameters for equation (29.1) are FB=939.68, K=1000, P10, T2 =
e-0.1*110>122=0.9200, sB=0.09, and T=10>12. The price of the call option 
is $9.49.
(b)  If the strike price is the quoted price that would be paid for the bond on 
exercise, 1 month’s accrued interest must be added to K because the maturity of the option is 1 month after a coupon date. This produces a value for K of
1,000+100*0.08333=1,008.33
The values for the other parameters in equation (29.1) are unchanged (i.e., 
FB=939.68, P10, T2=0.9200, sB=0.09, and T=0.8333). The price of the 
option is $7.97.
Figure 29.1 shows how the standard deviation of the logarithm of a bond’s price  
M29_HULL0654_11_GE_C29.indd   690 30/04/2021   17:47Interest Rate Derivatives: The Standard Market Models 691
changes as we look further ahead. The standard deviation is zero today because there is  
no uncertainty about the bond’s price today. It is also zero at the bond’s maturity 
because we know that the bond’s price will equal its face value at maturity. Between today and the maturity of the bond, the standard deviation first increases and then decreases.
The volatility 
sB that should be used when a European option on the bond is valued is
Standard deviation of logarithm of bond price at maturity of option
2Time to maturity of option
What happens when, for a particular underlying bond, the life of the option is increased? Figure 29.2 shows a typical pattern for 
sB as a function of the life of the option, with sB 
declining as the life of the option increases.

Yield Volatilities
The volatilities that are quoted for bond options are often yield volatilities rather than 
price volatilities. The duration concept, introduced in Chapter 4, is used by the market to convert a quoted yield volatility into a price volatility. Suppose that D is the modified  
duration of the bond underlying the option at the option maturity, as defined in  
Chapter 4. The relationship between the change 
∆FB in the forward bond price FB  
and the change ∆yF in the forward yield yF is
∆FB
FB≈-D∆yF
or
∆FB
FB≈-DyF ∆yF
yF
Volatility is a measure of the standard deviation of percentage changes in the value of a variable. This equation therefore suggests that the volatility of the forward bond price 
sB used in Black’s model can be approximately related to the volatility of the forward 
bond yield sy by
 sB=Dy0sy (29.4)
where y0 is the initial value of yF. When a yield volatility is quoted for a European bond 
option, the implicit assumption is usually that it will be converted to a price volatility using equation (29.4), and that this volatility will then be used in conjunction with  
equation (29.1) or (29.2) to obtain the option’s price. Suppose that the bond underlying a  
call option will have a modified duration of 5 years at option maturity, the forward yield  
is 8%, and the forward yield volatility quoted by a broker is 20%. This means that the market price of the option corresponding to the broker quote is the price given by equation (29.1) when the volatility variable 
sB is
5*0.08*0.2=0.08
or 8% per annum. Figure 29.2 shows that forward bond volatilities depend on the option considered. Forward yield volatilities as we have just defined them are more constant. This is why traders prefer them.
The Bond_Options worksheet of the software DerivaGem accompanying this book 
can be used to price European bond options using Black’s model by selecting Black- European as the Pricing Model. The user inputs a yield volatility, which is handled in the way just described. The strike price can be the cash or quoted strike price.
Example 29.2
Consider a European put option on a 10-year bond with a principal of 100. The 
coupon is 8% per year payable semiannually. The life of the option is 2.25 years and the strike price of the option is 115. The forward yield volatility is 20%. The zero curve is flat at 5% with continuous compounding. The DerivaGem software accompanying this book shows that the quoted price of the bond is 122.82. The price of the option when the strike price is a quoted price is $2.36. When the strike price is a cash price, the price of the option is $1.74. (See Problem 29.16 for the manual calculation.)
M29_HULL0654_11_GE_C29.indd   692 30/04/2021   17:47Interest Rate Derivatives: The Standard Market Models 693
An interest rate cap is a series of call options on interest rates. It can be understood by 
considering a floating-rate note where the interest rate is reset every three months.1 The  
interest rate for each three-month period is based on a three-month reference interest rate, applicable to the period, that is observed in the market. (For example, the interest rate on the floating-rate note could be the reference interest rate plus 25 basis points.) If  
a company borrows $10 million for five years using the floating-rate note and enters into a cap with a notional principal of $10 million and a strike price of 3% per annum, the company has ensured that the effective reference interest rate determining its loan interest payments will never be more than 3% per annum. If the reference interest rate for a particular quarter is less than 3%, there is no payoff for the quarter, but when this interest rate is greater than 3% there is a payoff designed to bring the effective reference  
interest rate down to 3% per annum. For example, if the reference interest rate for a period is 4%, the cap will provide a payoff of
0.25*$10,000,000*10.04-0.032=$25,000
to reduce the effective reference rate for the quarter to 3% per annum.
Similarly an interest rate floor is a series of put options on interest rates. A company 
that owns a $10 million floating-rate bond with quarterly resets might buy a floor with a  
strike price of 2% per annum. This would ensure that the reference interest rate each quarter determining the interest payments received is at least 2% per annum. If the reference interest rate in the market for a particular quarter is greater than 2%, there is  
no payoff for the quarter, but if this interest rate is less than 2%, there is a payoff  designed to bring the effective reference interest rate up to 2% per annum. For example,  
if the reference interest rate is 1.5% per annum, the floor will provide a payoff of
0.25*$10,000,000*10.02-0.0152=$12,500
LIBOR has traditionally been the most common reference rate in interest rate caps 
and floors. As LIBOR is phased out, it is likely that caps and floors based on reference rates calculated from overnight rates will become more popular (see Section 4.2). Here we present results for caps and floors where the reference rate is (like LIBOR) set in advance of a period. We then discuss possible adjustments to the models for reference rates based on overnight rates.
The Cap as a Portfolio of Interest Rate Options
Consider a cap with a total life of T, a principal of L, and a cap rate of RK. Suppose that  
the reset dates are t1, t2, c, tn and define tn+1=T. Define Rk as the floating interest 
rate for the period between time tk and tk+1 observed at time tk 11…k…n2. The cap 
leads to a payoff at time tk+1 1k=1, 2, c, n2 of
 Ldk max1Rk-RK, 02 (29.5)
where dk=tk+1-tk.2 Both Rk and RK are expressed with a compounding frequency 
equal to the frequency of resets.29.2 INTEREST RATE CAPS AND FLOORS
1  The time between resets (three months in this example) is known as the tenor.
2  Day count issues are discussed at the end of this section.
M29_HULL0654_11_GE_C29.indd   693 30/04/2021   17:47694 CHAPTER 29
Expression (29.5) is the payoff from a call option on the floating rate observed at time tk  
with the payoff occurring at time tk+1. The cap is a portfolio of n such options. Rates are  
observed at times t1, t2, t3, c, tn and the corresponding payoffs occur at  
times t2, t3, t4, c, tn+1. The n call options underlying the cap are known as caplets.
A Cap as a Portfolio of Bond Options
An interest rate cap can also be characterized as a portfolio of put options on zero- 
coupon bonds with payoffs on the puts occurring at the time they are calculated. The payoff in expression (29.5) at time 
tk+1 is equivalent to
Ldk
1+Rkdk max1Rk-RK, 02
at time tk. A few lines of algebra show that this reduces to
 maxcL-L11+RKdk2
1+Rkdk , 0d (29.6)
The expression
L11+RKdk2
1+Rkdk
is the value at time tk of a zero-coupon bond that pays off L11+RKdk2 at time tk+1. The  
expression in (29.6) is therefore the payoff from a put option with maturity tk on a zero- 
coupon bond with maturity tk+1 when the face value of the bond is L11+RKdk2 and the  
strike price is L. It follows that an interest rate cap can be regarded as a portfolio of European put options on zero-coupon bonds.
Floors and Collars
An interest rate floor is a portfolio of put options on interest rates or a portfolio of call  
options on zero-coupon bonds. Each of the individual options comprising a floor is known as a floorlet. A collar is an instrument designed to guarantee that the interest rate  
on an underlying floating-rate note always lies between two levels. A collar is a  
combination of a long position in a cap and a short position in a floor. It is usually  
constructed so that the price of the cap is initially equal to the price of the floor. The cost of entering into the collar is then zero.
Business Snapshot 29.1 gives the put–call parity relationship between caps and floors.
Valuation of Caps and Floors
As shown in equation (29.5), the caplet corresponding to the rate observed at time tk 
provides a payoff at time tk+1 of
Ldk max1Rk-RK, 02
Under the standard market model, the value of the caplet is
 LdkP10, tk+123Fk N1d12-RK N1d224 (29.7)
M29_HULL0654_11_GE_C29.indd   694 30/04/2021   17:47Interest Rate Derivatives: The Standard Market Models 695
Business Snapshot 29.1 Put–Call Parity for Caps and Floors
There is a put–call parity relationship between the prices of caps and floors. This is
Value of cap=Value of floor+Value of swap
In this relationship, the cap and floor have the same strike price, RK. The swap is an 
agreement to receive a floating rate, R, and pay a fixed rate of RK with no exchange of  
payments on the first reset date. All three instruments have the same life and the same  
frequency of payments.
To see that the result is true, consider a long position in the cap combined with a 
short position in the floor. The cap provides a cash flow of R-RK for periods when  
R is greater than RK. The short floor provides a cash flow of -1RK-R2=R-RK for  
periods when R is less than RK. There is therefore a cash flow of R-RK in all  
circumstances. This is the cash flow on the swap. It follows that the value of the cap 
minus the value of the floor must equal the value of the swap.
Note that LIBOR-for-fixed swaps are usually structured so that LIBOR at time 
zero determines a payment on the first reset date. LIBOR-based caps and floors are  
usually structured so that there is no payoff on the first reset date. The formula therefore needs adjustment when R is a LIBOR rate.
where
 d1=ln1Fk>RK2+s2
ktk>2
sk1tk
 d2=ln1Fk>RK2-s2
k tk>2
sk1tk=d1-sk1tk
Here, Fk is the forward interest rate at time 0 for the period between time tk and  
tk+1, and sk is the volatility of this forward interest rate. This is a natural extension of 
Black’s model. The volatility sk is multiplied by 1tk because the interest rate Rk is 
observed at time tk, but the risk-free discount factor P10, tk+12 reflects the fact that the 
payoff is at time tk+1, not time tk. The value of the corresponding floorlet is
 Ldk P10, tk+123RK N1-d22-Fk N1-d124 (29.8)
Example 29.3
Consider a contract that caps an interest rate on $10 million at 8% per annum  
(with quarterly compounding) for 3 months starting in 1 year. The interest rate is observed at time 1 year and paid at time 1.25 years. This is a caplet and could be  
one element of a cap. Suppose that the forward interest rate for the period covered by the caplet is 7% per annum with quarterly compounding and the volatility of  
this forward rate is 20% per annum. The continuously compounded risk-free  
zero rate for all maturities is 6.5%. In equation (29.7), 
Fk=0.07, dk=0.25, 
L=10, RK=0.08, tk=1.0, tk+1=1.25, P10, tk+12=e-0.065*1.25=0.9220,  
and sk=0.20. Also,
 d1=ln10.07>0.082+0.22*1>2
0.20*1=-0.5677
 d2=d1-0.20=-0.7677
M29_HULL0654_11_GE_C29.indd   695 30/04/2021   17:47696 CHAPTER 29
so that the caplet price (in $ millions) is
0.25*10*0.922030.07N1-0.56772-0.08N1-0.767724=0.00519
This result can also be obtained using the DerivaGem software accompanying 
this book.
Each caplet of a cap must be valued separately using equation (29.7). Similarly, each floorlet of a floor must be valued separately using equation (29.8). One approach is to use  
a different volatility for each caplet (or floorlet). The volatilities are then referred to as spot volatilities. An alternative approach is to use the same volatility for all the caplets (floorlets) comprising any particular cap (floor) but to vary this volatility according to the life of the cap (floor). The volatilities used are then referred to as flat volatilities.
3 Flat  
volatilities are akin to cumulative averages of spot volatilities and are therefore less variable as a function of maturity. The volatilities quoted in the market are usually flat volatilities. However, many traders like to estimate spot volatilities because this allows them to identify underpriced and overpriced caplets (floorlets).
There is a smile or skew in the implied volatilities calculated from caplet/floorlet prices. 
Some analysts choose to model this with the SABR model which was introduced in  
Section 27.2. This can be useful in managing the risks associated with smile movements.
Theoretical Justification for the Model
The extension of Black’s model used to value a caplet can be shown to be internally  
consistent by considering a world defined by a numeraire equal to a risk-free zero-coupon  
bond maturing at time tk+1. Section 28.4 shows that:
1. The current value of any security is its expected value at time tk+1 in this world  
multiplied by the price of a zero-coupon bond maturing at time tk+1 (see  
equation (28.20)).
2. The expected value of a risk-free interest rate lasting between times tk and tk+1 
equals the forward interest rate in this world (see equation (28.22)).
The first of these results shows that, with the notation introduced earlier, the price of a caplet that provides a payoff at time 
tk+1 is
 Ldk P10, tk+12Ek+13max1Rk-RK, 024 (29.9)
where Ek+1 denotes expected value in a world defined by a numeraire equal to a zero- 
coupon bond maturing at time tk+1. When the forward interest rate underlying the cap  
(initially Fk) is assumed to have a constant volatility sk, Rk is lognormal in the world we  
are considering, with the standard deviation of ln1Rk2 equal to sk1tk. From  
equation (15A.1), the caplet price in equation (29.9) becomes
LdkP10, tk+123Ek+11Rk2N1d12-RK N1d224
where
 d1=ln3Ek+11Rk2>RK4+s2
ktk>2
sk1tk
 d2=ln3Ek+11Rk2>RK4-s2
ktk>2
sk1tk=d1-sk1tk
3  Flat volatilities can be calculated from spot volatilities and vice versa (see Problem 29.20).
M29_HULL0654_11_GE_C29.indd   696 30/04/2021   17:47Interest Rate Derivatives: The Standard Market Models 697
The second result implies that
Ek+11Rk2=Fk
which leads to the result in equation (29.7). Note that the results we have used from 
Section 28.4 are correct when any yield curve is used to define Rk and Fk. (It does not 
have to be the risk-free yield curve underlying P10, tk+12.)
Use of DerivaGem
The software DerivaGem accompanying this book can be used to price interest rate caps and floors using Black’s model. In the Cap_and_Swap_Options worksheet select Cap/Floor as the Underlying Type and Black-European as the Pricing Model. Forward  
rates for the underlying floating reference rate are input with a compounding frequency  
corresponding to the tenor. These are used to determine the 
Fk. Continuously  
compounded OIS rates are input to determine the discount factor P10, tk+12. The inputs 
include the start and end date of the period covered by the cap, the flat volatility, and the  
cap settlement frequency (i.e., the tenor). The software calculates the payment dates by  
working back from the end of period covered by the cap to the beginning. The initial caplet/floorlet is assumed to cover a period of length between 0.5 and 1.5 times a regular  
period. Suppose, for example, that the period covered by the cap is 1.22 years to 2.80  
years and the settlement frequency is quarterly. There are six caplets covering the periods  
2.55 to 2.80 years, 2.30 to 2.55 years, 2.05 to 2.30 years, 1.80 to 2.05 years, 1.55 to  
1.80 years, and 1.22 to 1.55 years.
The Impact of Day Count Conventions
The formulas we have presented so far in this section do not reflect day count  
conventions (see Section 6.1 for an explanation of day count conventions). Suppose 
that the cap rate RK is expressed with an actual >360 day count (as would be normal in  
the United States). This means that the time interval dk in the formulas should be 
replaced by ak, the accrual fraction for the time period between tk and tk+1. Suppose, for  
example, that tk is May 1 and tk+1 is August 1. Under actual >360 there are 92 days 
between these payment dates so that ak=92>360=0.2556. The forward rate Fk must 
be expressed with an actual >360 day count. This means that we must set it by solving
1+akFk=P10, tk2
P10, tk+12
The impact of all this is much the same as calculating dk on an actual/actual basis  
converting RK from actual >360 to actual/actual, and calculating Fk on an actual/actual 
basis by solving
1+dkFk=P10, tk2
P10, tk+12
Negative Rates
Negative interest rates became a feature of financial markets in 2014. By the end of the  
first half of 2016, interest rates were negative for the Swedish krona, Danish krone, Japanese yen, euro, and Swiss franc. It was then estimated that more than $10 trillion of  
government bonds worldwide had negative yields.
M29_HULL0654_11_GE_C29.indd   697 30/04/2021   17:48698 CHAPTER 29
From an economics perspective, negative rates make no sense. (Why pay an entity to  
have use of your funds?) They also present a challenge to modelers. The standard  
market model for valuing caps and floors assumes that the relevant future interest rate 
is lognormal so that it cannot become negative. One quick fix is to use what is known as the shifted lognormal model. In this, a future interest rate plus a spread, 
a, is assumed to  
be lognormal. Caps and floors can then be valued using equations (29.7) and (29.8)  
with Fk replaced by Fk+a and RK replaced by RK+a. The shift a, when used with flat  
volatilities, sometimes depends on the cap/floor maturity. The SABR model can be adjusted in a similar way to become a shifted SABR model.
An alternative is to use the Bachelier normal model. In a world defined by the 
numeraire 
P10, tk+12, the process for the forward rate underlying a caplet on the 
1tk, tk+12 rate in the standard market model is assumed to be
dFk=skFk dz
where dz is a Wiener process. In the Bachelier normal model, it is
dFk=s*
k dz
Consistent with the equivalent martingale measure results in Chapter 28, both  
processes are martingales. The Bachelier model leads to a normal rather than  
lognormal distribution for the underlying rate and so allows rates to become negative. Equation (29.7) for a caplet becomes
LdkP10, tk+1231Fk-RK2N1d2+s*
k1tk N/uni20321d24
and equation (29.8) for a floorlet becomes
LdkP10, tk+1231RK-Fk2N1-d2+s*
k1tk N/uni20321d24
where
d=Fk-RK
s*
k1tk
and N/uni20321x2 is the normal distribution’s density function (see equation (19.2)). Note that  
the volatility parameters, sk and s*
k, in the two models are quite different. For  
example, when the forward interest rate is 3%, sk might be 33% while s*
k is about 1%. 
Both the Bachelier normal and shifted lognormal models are implemented for caps, floors, and swaptions in DerivaGem 4.00.
Backward-Looking Reference Rates
The analysis so far has assumed that the reference rate underlying a cap or floor is observed at the beginning of a period and paid at the end of the period. This is not the case for reference rates based on overnight rates (see Section 4.2). A “quick and dirty” way of adjusting the models we have presented in (29.7) and (29.8) to value caps and floors for these reference rates is to:
• Define 
Fk as the forward rate calculated from the OIS zero curve for the period 
between tk and tk+1.
• Replace tk by 0.51tk+tk+12 in the definitions of d1 and d2.
M29_HULL0654_11_GE_C29.indd   698 30/04/2021   17:48Interest Rate Derivatives: The Standard Market Models 699
This reflects the fact that the underlying one-day rates are, on average, observed halfway  
through the accrual period.
When there is less than one accrual period until the reset date, some overnight rates 
that will comprise the next settlement rate have already been observed. These should be  
reflected in Fk and tk should be replaced by the average of the times until the remaining 
one-day rates will be observed.
29.3 EUROPEAN SWAP OPTIONS
Swap options, or swaptions, are options on interest rate swaps and are another popular  
type of interest rate option. They give the holder the right to enter into a certain interest  
rate swap at a certain time in the future. (The holder does not, of course, have to  
exercise this right.) Many large financial institutions that offer interest rate swap  
contracts to their corporate clients are also prepared to sell them swaptions or buy 
swaptions from them. As shown in Business Snapshot 29.2, a swaption can be viewed as  
a type of bond option.
To give an example of how a swaption might be used, consider a company that knows 
that in 6 months it will enter into a 5-year floating-rate loan agreement and knows that it  
will wish to swap the floating interest payments for fixed interest payments to convert the  
loan into a fixed-rate loan (see Chapter 7 for a discussion of how swaps can be used in  
this way). At a cost, the company could enter into a swaption giving it the right to receive the 6-month floating rate and pay a certain fixed rate of interest, say 3% per annum, for a 5-year period starting in 6 months. If the fixed rate exchanged for floating  
on a regular 5-year swap in 6 months turns out to be less than 3% per annum, the  
company will choose not to exercise the swaption and will enter into a swap agreement  
in the usual way. However, if it turns out to be greater than 3% per annum, the  
company will choose to exercise the swaption and will obtain a swap at more favorable terms than those available in the market.
Swaptions, when used in the way just described, provide companies with a guarantee  
that the fixed rate of interest they will pay on a loan at some future time will not exceed  
some level. They are an alternative to forward swaps (sometimes called deferred swaps).  
Forward swaps involve no up-front cost but have the disadvantage of obligating the  
company to enter into a swap agreement. With a swaption, the company is able to benefit  
from favorable interest rate movements while acquiring protection from unfavorable interest rate movements. The difference between a swaption and a forward swap is analogous to the difference between an option on a foreign currency and a forward contract on the currency.
Valuation of European Swaptions
As explained in Chapter 7, the swap rate for a particular maturity at a particular time is  
the (mid-market) fixed rate that would be exchanged for the floating rate in a newly issued swap with that maturity. The model usually used to value a European option on  
a swap assumes that the underlying swap rate at the maturity of the option is  
lognormal. Consider a swaption where the holder has the right to pay a rate 
sK and 
receive the floating rate on a swap that will last n years starting in T years. We suppose that there are m payments per year under the swap and that the notional principal is L.
M29_HULL0654_11_GE_C29.indd   699 30/04/2021   17:48700 CHAPTER 29
Chapter 7 showed that day count conventions may lead to the fixed payments under a  
swap being slightly different on each payment date. For now we will ignore the effect of  
day count conventions and assume that each fixed payment on the swap is the fixed rate  
times L>m. The impact of day count conventions is considered at the end of this  
section.
Suppose that the swap rate for an n-year swap starting at time T proves to be sT. By 
comparing the cash flows on a swap where the fixed rate is sT to the cash flows on a swap 
where the fixed rate is sK, it can be seen that the payoff from the swaption consists of a 
series of cash flows equal to
L
m max1sT-sK, 02
The cash flows are received m times per year for the n years of the life of the swap.  
Suppose that the swap payment dates are T1, T2, c, Tmn, measured in years from today.  
(It is approximately true that Ti=T+i>m.) Each cash flow is the payoff from a call 
option on sT with strike price sK.
Whereas a cap is a portfolio of options on interest rates, a swaption is a single option 
on the swap rate with repeated payoffs. The standard market model gives the value of a  
swaption where the holder has the right to pay sK as
amn
i=1L
m P10, Ti23sF N1d12-sK N1d224
where
 d1=ln1sF>sK2+s2T>2
s2T
 d2=ln1sF>sK2-s2T>2
s2T=d1-s2T
sF is the forward swap rate at time zero, and s is the volatility of the forward swap rate (so  
that s2T is the standard deviation of ln sT).
This is a natural extension of Black’s model. The volatility s is multiplied by 2T.  
The amn
i=1P10, Ti2 term is the discount factor for the mn payoffs. Defining A  as the value 
of a contract that pays 1>m at times Ti 11…i…mn2, the value of the swaption becomes
 LA3sF N1d12-sK N1d224 (29.10)Business Snapshot 29.2  Swaptions and Bond Options
As explained in Chapter 7, an interest rate swap can be regarded as an agreement to  
exchange a fixed-rate bond for a floating-rate bond. At the start of a swap, the value 
of the floating-rate bond always equals the principal amount of the swap. A swaption  
can therefore be regarded as an option to exchange a fixed-rate bond for the principal  
amount of the swap—that is, a type of bond option.
If a swaption gives the holder the right to pay fixed and receive floating, it is a put 
option on the fixed-rate bond with strike price equal to the principal. If a swaption gives the holder the right to pay floating and receive fixed, it is a call option on the fixed-rate bond with a strike price equal to the principal.

where
A=1
mamn
i=1P10, Ti2
If the swaption gives the holder the right to receive a fixed rate of sK instead of paying it,  
the payoff from the swaption is
L
m max1sK-sT, 02
This is a put option on sT. As before, the payoffs are received at times Ti 11…i…mn2.  
The standard market model gives the value of the swaption as
 LA3sK N1-d22-sF N1-d124 (29.11)
DerivaGem can be used to value swaptions using Black’s model. In the Cap_and_
Swap_Options worksheet, select Swap Options as the Underlying Type and Black- 
European as the pricing model. Inputs are similar to those for caps. Forward rates are used to determine the forward swap rate. If this forward swap rate is known, the forward  
rates can be input as flat and equal to the known value.
Example 29.4
Suppose that the risk-free zero curve is flat at 6% per annum with continuous 
compounding. Consider a swaption that gives the holder the right to pay 6.2% in a 3-year swap starting in 5 years. Payments are made semiannually and the principal  
is $100 million. The forward swap rate is 6.1% with continuous compounding, which translates as 6.194% with semiannual compounding. The volatility of the forward swap rate is 20%. In this case,
A=1
21e-0.06*5.5+e-0.06*6+e-0.06*6.5+e-0.06*7+e-0.06*7.5+e-0.06*82=2.0035
Also, sF=0.06194, sK=0.062, T=5, and s=0.2, so that
 d1=ln10.06194>0.0622+0.22*5>2
0.225=0.2214
 d2=d1-0.225=-0.2258
From equation (29.10), the value of the swaption (in $ millions) is
100*2.0035*30.06194*N10.22142-0.062*N1-0.225824=2.19
(This is in agreement with the price given by DerivaGem.)
Theoretical Justification for the Swaption Model
The extension of Black’s model used for swaptions can be shown to be internally  
consistent by considering a world defined by a numeraire equal to the annuity A. The analysis in Section 28.4 shows that:
1. The current value of any security is the current value of the annuity multiplied by the expected value of
Security price at time T
Value of the annuity at time T
in this world (see equation (28.25)).
M29_HULL0654_11_GE_C29.indd   701 30/04/2021   17:48702 CHAPTER 29
2. The expected value of the swap rate at time T in this world equals the forward 
swap rate (see equation (28.24)).
The first result shows that the value of the swaption is
LAEA3max1sT-sK, 024
From equation (15A.1), this is
LA3EA1sT2N1d12-sK N1d224
where
d1=ln3EA1sT2>sK4+s2T>2
s2T
 d2=ln3EA1sT2>sK4-s2T>2
s2T=d1-s2T
The second result shows that EA1sT2 equals sF. The results lead to the swap option pricing  
formula in equation (29.10). They show that interest rates can be treated as constant for  
the purposes of discounting provided that the expected swap rate is set equal to the  
forward swap rate. Note that the results in Section 28.4 show that this theoretical result is  
valid when the floating rate in the underlying swap is not the same as the risk-free rate.
The Impact of Day Count Conventions
The above formulas can be made more precise by considering day count conventions. The fixed rate for the swap underlying the swap option is expressed with a day count  
convention such as actual
>365 or 30 >360. Suppose that T0=T and that, for the  
applicable day count convention, the accrual fraction corresponding to the time period  
between Ti-1 and Ti is ai. (For example, if Ti-1 corresponds to March 1 and Ti  
corresponds to September 1 and the day count is actual >365, ai=184>365=0.5041.)  
The formulas that have been presented are then correct with the annuity factor A being defined as
A=amn
i=1aiP10, Ti2
Negative Rates
The shifted lognormal model can be used to handle the possibility of negative interest rates when swaptions are valued. Equations (29.10) and (29.11) are used with with 
sF 
replaced by sF+a and sK replaced by sK+a. The shift, a, in practice often depends on  
both the life of the option and the life of the underlying swap. The Bachelier normal model can also be used. When the holder has the right to pay 
sK, equation (29.10)  
becomes
LA31sF-sK2N1d2+s*2TN/uni20321d24
and when the holder has the right to receive sK, equation (29.11) becomes
LA31sK-sF2N1-d2+s*2TN/uni20321d24
where s*2T is the standard deviation of sT and

This section discusses how the material on Greek letters in Chapter 19 can be extended 
to cover interest rate derivatives.
In the context of interest rate derivatives, delta risk is the risk associated with a shift 
in the zero curve. Because there are many ways in which the zero curve can shift, many deltas can be calculated. Some alternatives are:
1. Calculate the impact of a 1-basis-point parallel shift in the zero curve. This is sometimes termed a DV01.
2. Calculate the impact of small changes in the quotes for each of the instruments 
used to construct the zero curve.
3. Divide the zero curve (or the forward curve) into a number of sections (or  
buckets). Calculate the impact of shifting the rates in one bucket by 1 basis point, keeping the rest of the initial term structure unchanged. (This is described in  
Business Snapshot 6.3.)
4. Carry out a principal components analysis as outlined in Section 22.9. Calculate a 
delta with respect to the changes in each of the first few factors. The first delta then measures the impact of a small, approximately parallel, shift in the zero curve; the second delta measures the impact of a small twist in the zero curve; and so on.
In practice, traders tend to prefer the second approach. They argue that the only way the zero curve can change is if the quote for one of the instruments used to compute the zero curve changes. They therefore feel that it makes sense to focus on the exposures arising from changes in the prices of these instruments.
When several delta measures are calculated, there are many possible gamma measures.  
Suppose that 10 instruments are used to compute the zero curve and that deltas are  
calculated by considering the impact of changes in the quotes for each of these. Gamma is a second partial derivative of the form 
02Π>0xi 0xj, where Π is the portfolio value.  
There are 10 choices for xi and 10 choices for xj and a total of 55 different gamma  
measures. This may be “information overload”. One approach is ignore cross-gammas and focus on the 10 partial derivatives where 
i=j. Another is to calculate a single  
gamma measure as the second partial derivative of the value of the portfolio with respect  
to a parallel shift in the zero curve. A further possibility is to calculate gammas with respect to the first two factors in a principal components analysis.
The vega of a portfolio of interest rate derivatives measures its exposure to volatility 
changes. One approach is to calculate the impact on the portfolio of making the same small change to the Black volatilities of all caps and European swap options. However, this assumes that one factor drives all volatilities and may be too simplistic. A better idea is to carry out a principal components analysis on the volatilities of caps and swap options and calculate vega measures corresponding to the first two or three factors.
SUMMARY
Black’s model and its extensions provide a popular approach for valuing European- style interest rate options. The essence of Black’s model is that the value of the variable  
underlying the option is assumed to be lognormal at the maturity of the option. In the 29.4 HEDGING INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES
M29_HULL0654_11_GE_C29.indd   703 30/04/2021   17:48704 CHAPTER 29
case of a European bond option, Black’s model assumes that the underlying bond price 
is lognormal at the option’s maturity. For a cap, the model assumes that the interest rates underlying each of the constituent caplets are lognormally distributed. In the case  
of a swap option, the model assumes that the underlying swap rate is lognormally  
distributed.
The models presented in this chapter are not consistent with each other. For example,  
when future bond prices are lognormal, future interest rates and swap rates are not lognormal; when future interest rates are lognormal, future bond prices and swap rates are not lognormal. The models cannot easily be extended to value instruments such as American swap options. Chapters 32 and 33 present more general interest rate models, which, although more complex, can be used for a much wider range of products.
Black’s model involves calculating the expected payoff based on the assumption that  
the expected value of a variable equals its forward value and then discounting the expected payoff at the zero rate observed in the market today. This is the correct  
procedure for the “plain vanilla” instruments we have considered in this chapter.  
However, as we shall see in the next chapter, it is not correct in all situations.

Practice Questions
 29.1. A company caps a 3-month floating rate at 2% per annum. The principal amount is $20 million. On a reset date, the floating rate is 4% per annum. What payment would this lead to under the cap? When would the payment be made?
 29.2. Explain why a swap option can be regarded as a type of bond option.
 29.3. Use the Black’s model to value a 1-year European put option on a 10-year bond. Assume that the current cash price of the bond is $125, the strike price is $110, the 1-year risk-free interest rate is 10% per annum, the bond’s forward price volatility is 8% per annum, and the present value of the coupons to be paid during the life of the option is $10.

 29.6. A bank uses Black’s model to price European bond options. Suppose that an implied price volatility for a 5-year option on a bond maturing in 10 years is used to price a 9-year option  
on the bond. Would you expect the resultant price to be too high or too low? Explain your  
answer.
M29_HULL0654_11_GE_C29.indd   704 30/04/2021   17:48Interest Rate Derivatives: The Standard Market Models 705
 29.7. Calculate the value of a 4-year European call option on bond that will mature 5 years 
from today using Black’s model. The 5-year cash bond price is $105, the cash price of a 4-year bond with the same coupon is $102 and both bonds have a principal of $100. The strike price of the option is $100, the 4-year risk-free interest rate is 10% per annum with continuous compounding, and the forward bond price volatility for the bond underlying the option is 2% per annum.
 29.8. If the yield volatility for a 5-year put option on a bond maturing in 10 years time is  
specified as 22%, how should the option be valued? Assume that, based on today’s  
interest rates the modified duration of the bond at the maturity of the option will be  
4.2 years and the forward yield on the bond is 7%.

 29.12. Explain why there is an arbitrage opportunity if the implied Black (flat) volatility of a 
cap is different from that of a floor.
 29.13. When a bond’s price is lognormal can the bond’s yield be negative? Explain your answer.
 29.14. What is the value of a European swap option that gives the holder the right to enter into  
a 3-year annual-pay swap in 4 years where a fixed rate of 5% is paid and floating is 
received? The swap principal is $10 million. Assume that the volatility of the swap rate is  
20%, all swap rates are are 5%, and all OIS rates are 4.7%. Compare your answer with that given by DerivaGem.
 29.15. Suppose that the yield R on a zero-coupon bond follows the process
dR=mdt+sdz
where m and s are functions of R and t, and dz is a Wiener process. Use Itô’s lemma to 
show that the volatility of the zero-coupon bond price declines to zero as it approaches 
maturity.
 29.16. Carry out a manual calculation to verify the option prices in Example 29.2.
 29.17. Suppose that all risk-free (OIS) zero rates are 6.5% (continuously compounded). The 
price of a 5-year semiannual cap on LIBOR with a principal of $100 and a cap rate of 8% (semiannually compounded) is $3. Use DerivaGem to determine:
(a) The implied 5-year flat volatility for caps and floors
(b) The floor rate in a zero-cost 5-year collar when the cap rate is 8%.
Assume that all 6-month LIBOR forward rates are 6.7% with semiannual compounding.
 29.18. Show that 
V1+f=V2, where V1 is the value of a swaption to pay a fixed rate of sK and 
receive floating between times T1 and T2, f is the value of a forward swap to receive a  
fixed rate of sK and pay floating between times T1 and T2, and V2 is the value of a  
swaption to receive a fixed rate of sK between times T1 and T2. Deduce that V1=V2 when  
sK equals the current forward swap rate.
 29.19. Suppose that risk-free zero rates and LIBOR forward rates are as in Problem 29.17. Use 
DerivaGem to determine the value of an option to pay a fixed rate of 6% and receive LIBOR on a 5-year swap starting in 1 year. Assume that the principal is $100 million, payments are exchanged semiannually, and the swap rate volatility is 21%.
M29_HULL0654_11_GE_C29.indd   705 30/04/2021   17:48706 CHAPTER 29
 29.20. Describe how you would (a) calculate cap flat volatilities from cap spot volatilities and 
(b) calculate cap spot volatilities from cap flat volatilities.
 29.21. Consider an 8-month European put option on a Treasury bond that currently has 14.25 
years to maturity. The current cash bond price is $910, the exercise price is $900, and the  
volatility for the bond price is 10% per annum. A coupon of $35 will be paid by the bond in 3 months. The risk-free interest rate is 8% for all maturities up to 1 year. Use Black’s model to determine the price of the option. Consider both the case where the strike price corresponds to the cash price of the bond and the case where it corresponds to the quoted price.
 29.22. A swaption gives the holder the right to receive 7.6% in a 5-year swap starting in 4 years. 
Payments are made annually. The forward swap rate is 8% with annual compounding and its volatility is 25% per annum. The principal is $1 million and risk-free (OIS) rates for all maturities are 7.8% (with continuous compounding). Use Black’s model to price the swaption. Compare your answer to that given by DerivaGem.
 29.23. Use the DerivaGem software to value a 5-year collar that guarantees that the maximum 
and minimum interest rates on a LIBOR-based loan (with quarterly resets) are 7%  
and 5%, respectively. All 3-month LIBOR forward rates are 6% per annum (with  
quarterly compounding). The flat volatility is 20%. Assume that the principal is $100  
and the risk-free (OIS) term structure is flat at 5.8%.
 29.24. Use the DerivaGem software to value a European swaption that gives you the right in  
2 years to enter into a 5-year swap in which you pay a fixed rate of 6% and receive  
floating. Cash flows are exchanged semiannually on the swap. The continuously  
compounded 1-year, 2-year, 5-year, and 10-year risk-free (OIS) zero rates are 5%,  
6%, 6.5%, and 7%, respectively. Assume a principal of $100. The forward swap rate  
is 7% (compounded semiannually) and its volatility is 15% per annum. Give an example 
of how the swaption might be used by a corporation. What bond option is equivalent to the swaption?

Convexity,

Adjustments30 CHAPTER  
A popular two-step procedure for valuing a European-style derivative is:
1. Calculate the expected payoff by assuming that the expected value of each 
 underlying variable equals its forward value
2. Discount the expected payoff at the risk-free rate applicable for the time period 
between the valuation date and the payoff date.
We first used this procedure when valuing FRAs and swaps. Chapter 4 shows that an  
FRA can be valued by calculating the payoff on the assumption that the forward  interest rate will be realized and then discounting the payoff at the risk-free rate. 
 Similarly, Chapter 7 extends this, showing that swaps can be valued by calculating 
cash flows on the assumption that forward rates will be realized and discounting the cash flows at risk-free rates. Chapters 18 and 28 show that Black’s model provides a general approach to valuing a wide range of European options—and Black’s model is an application of the two-step procedure. The models presented in Chapter 29 for bond options, caps/floors, and swap options are all examples of the two-step procedure.
This raises the issue of whether it is always correct to value European-style interest 
rate derivatives by using the two-step procedure. The answer is no! For nonstandard interest rate derivatives, it is sometimes necessary to modify the two-step procedure so that an adjustment is made to the forward value of the variable in the first step. This chapter considers three types of adjustments: convexity adjustments, timing adjust-ments, and quanto adjustments.
30.1 CONVEXITY ADJUSTMENTS
Consider first an instrument that provides a payoff dependent on a bond yield observed at the time of the payoff.
Usually the forward value of a variable S is calculated with reference to a forward 
contract that pays off 
ST-K at time T. It is the value of K that causes the contract to 
M30_HULL0654_11_GE_C30.indd   707 30/04/2021   17:49708 CHAPTER 30
have zero value. Forward yields are defined differently. A forward bond yield is the yield 
implied by the forward bond price.
Suppose that BT is the price of a bond at time T, yT is its yield, and the (bond pricing) 
relationship between BT and yT is
BT=G1yT2
Define BF as the forward bond price at time zero for a transaction maturing at time T 
and yF as the forward bond yield at time zero. The definition of a forward bond yield 
means that
BF=G1yF2
The function G is nonlinear. This means that, when the expected future bond price equals the forward bond price (so that we are in a world defined by a numeraire equal to a zero-coupon bond maturing at time T), the expected future bond yield does not equal the forward bond yield.
This is illustrated in Figure 30.1, which shows the relationship between bond prices 
and bond yields at time T. For simplicity, suppose that there are only three  possible  
bond prices, 
B1, B2, and B3 and that they are equally likely in a world defined by 
numeraire P1t, T2. Assume that the bond prices are equally spaced, so that B 2 - B1 =  
B3 - B2. The forward bond price is the expected bond price B2. The bond prices 
 translate into three equally likely bond yields: y1, y2, and y3. These are not equally 
spaced. The variable y2 is the forward bond yield because it is the yield corresponding 
to the forward bond price. The expected bond yield is the average of y1, y2, and y3 and 
is clearly greater than y2.
Consider a derivative that provides a payoff dependent on the bond yield at time T.  
From equation (28.20), it can be valued by (a) calculating the expected payoff in a 
world defined by a numeraire equal to a zero-coupon bond maturing at time T and  
(b) discounting at the current risk-free rate for maturity T. We know that the expected bond price equals the forward price in the world being considered. We therefore need to know the value of the expected bond yield when the expected bond price equals the 
Figure 30.1 Relationship between bond prices and bond yields at time T.

forward bond price. The analysis in the appendix at the end of this chapter shows that 
an approximate expression for the required expected bond yield is
 ET1yT2=yF-1
2y2
F s2yTG/uni20331yF2
G/uni20321yF2 (30.1)
where G/uni2032 and G/uni2033 denote the first and second partial derivatives of G, ET denotes 
expectations in a world that is defined by numeraire P1t, T2, and sy is the forward yield 
volatility. It follows that the expected payoff can be discounted at the current risk-free 
rate for maturity T provided the expected bond yield is assumed to be
yF-1

rather than yF. The difference between the expected bond yield and the forward bond

is known as a convexity adjustment. It corresponds to the difference between y2 and the 
expected yield in Figure 30.1. (The convexity adjustment is positive because G/uni20321yF260 
and G/uni20331yF270.)
In addition to valuing a derivative dependent on a bond yield, equation (30.1) can be 
used to value a derivative dependent on a swap rate. We make the approximation that 
the N-year swap rate at time T equals the yield at that time on an N-year bond with a 
coupon equal to today’s forward swap rate.
Example 30.1
Consider an instrument that provides a payoff in 3 years equal to the 3-year swap 
rate at that time multiplied by $100. Suppose that payments are made  annually 
on the swap, the swap rate for all maturities is 6% per annum with annual  compounding, the volatility for the forward swap rate (implied from swap option 
prices) is 22%. The 3-year risk-free zero rate is 5% with annual compounding. When the swap rate is approximated as the yield on a 6% bond, the relevant function G(y) is
G1y2=0.06
1+y+0.06
11+y22+1.06
11+y23
G/uni20321y2=-0.06
11+y22-0.12
11+y23-3.18
11+y24
G/uni20331y2=0.12
11+y23+0.36
11+y24+12.72
11+y25
In this case the forward yield yF is 0.06, so that G/uni20321yF2=-2.6730 and 
G/uni20331yF2=9.8910. From equation (30.1),
ET1yT2=0.06+1
2*0.062*0.222*3*9.8910
2.6730=0.06097
M30_HULL0654_11_GE_C30.indd   709 30/04/2021   17:49710 CHAPTER 30
A forward swap rate of 6.097% rather than 6% should therefore be assumed 
when valuing the instrument. The instrument is worth
100*0.06097
1.053=5.27
or $5.27. (This compares with a price of $5.18 obtained without any convexity adjustment.)
30.2 TIMING ADJUSTMENTS
In this section consider the situation where a market variable V is observed at time T and its value is used to calculate a payoff that occurs at a later time 
T *. Define:
VT:  Value of V at time T
ET1VT2:  Expected value of VT in a world defined by numeraire P1t, T2
ET *1VT2:  Expected value of VT in a world defined by numeraire P1t, T *2.
The numeraire ratio when we move from the P1t, T2 numeraire to the P1t, T *2 numeraire 
(see Section 28.8) is
W=P1t, T *2
P1t, T2
This is the forward price of a zero-coupon bond lasting between times T and T *. Define:
sV:  Volatility of V
sW:  Volatility of W
rVW:  Correlation between V and W.
From equation (28.35), the change of numeraire increases the growth rate of V  by aV, 
where
 aV=rVWsVsW (30.2)
This result can be expressed in terms of the forward interest rate between times T  and T *. 
Define:
RF:   Forward interest rate for period between T  and T *, expressed with a compound-
ing frequency of m
sR:  Volatility of RF.
The relationship between W and RF is
W=1
11+RF>m2m1T *-T2
The relationship between the volatility of W and the volatility of RF can be calculated 
from Itô’s lemma as
sWW=sRRF 0W
0RF=-sRRF1T *-T2
11+RF>m2m1T *-T2+1
M30_HULL0654_11_GE_C30.indd   710 30/04/2021   17:49Convexity, Timing, and Quanto Adjustments 711
so that
sW=-sRRF1T *-T2
1+RF>m
Hence equation (30.2) becomes1
aV=-rVRsVsRRF1T *-T2
1+RF>m
where rVR=-rVW is the instantaneous correlation between V and RF. As an approxi-
mation, it can be assumed that RF remains constant at its initial value and that the 
volatilities and correlation in this expression are constant to get, at time zero,
 ET*1VT2=ET1VT2expc-rVRsVsRRF1T *-T2
1+RF>mTd (30.3)
Example 30.2
Consider a derivative that provides a payoff in 6 years equal to the value of a stock 
index observed in 5 years. Suppose that 1,200 is the forward value of the stock index for a contract maturing in 5 years. Suppose that the volatility of the index is 20%, the volatility of the forward risk-free interest rate between years 5 and 6 is  
18%, and the correlation between the two is 
-0.4. Suppose further that the risk-
free zero curve is flat at 8% with annual compounding. The results just produced can be used with V  defined as the value of the index, 
T=5, T *=6, m=1, 
RF=0.08, rVR=-0.4, sV=0.20, and sR=0.18, so that
ET *1VT2=ET1VT2expc--0.4*0.20*0.18*0.08*1
1+0.08*5d
or ET *1VT2=1.00535ET1VT2. From the arguments in Chapter 28, ET1VT2 is the 
forward price of the index, or 1,200. It follows that ET *1VT2=1,200*1.00535 = 
1,206.42. Using again the arguments in Chapter 28, it follows from equation (28.20) that the value of the derivative is 
1,206.42*P10, 62. In this case, P10, 62 = 
1>1.086=0.6302, so that the value of the derivative is 760.25.
1  Variables RF and W  are negatively correlated. We can reflect this by setting sW=-sRRF1T *-T2>11+RF>m2,  
which is a negative number, and setting rVW=rVR. Alternatively we can change the sign of sW so that it is 
positive and set rVW=-rVR. In either case, we end up with the same formula for aV.30.3 QUANTOS
A quanto or cross-currency derivative is an instrument where two currencies are 
involved. The payoff is defined in terms of a variable that is measured in one of the currencies and the payoff is made in the other currency. One example of a quanto is the CME futures contract on the Nikkei discussed in Business Snapshot 5.3. The market variable underlying this contract is the Nikkei 225 index (which is measured in yen), but the contract is settled in U.S. dollars.
Consider a quanto that provides a payoff in currency X at time T. Assume that the 
payoff depends on the value V of a variable that is observed in currency Y at time T.
M30_HULL0654_11_GE_C30.indd   711 30/04/2021   17:49712 CHAPTER 30
Define:
PX1t, T2:   Value at time t in currency X of a zero-coupon bond paying off 1 unit of 
currency X at time T
PY1t, T2:    Value at time t in currency Y of a zero-coupon bond paying off 1 unit of 
currency Y at time T
VT:   Value of V at time T
EX1VT2:  Expected value of VT in a world defined by numeraire PX1t, T2
EY1VT2:  Expected value of VT in a world defined by numeraire PY1t, T2.
The numeraire ratio when we move from the PY1t, T2 numeraire to the PX1t, T2 
numeraire is
W1t2=PX1t, T2
PY1t, T2S1t2
where S1t2 is the spot exchange rate (units of Y per unit of X) at time t. It follows from 
this that the numeraire ratio W1t2 is the forward exchange rate (units of Y  per unit of X ) 
for a contract maturing at time T. Define:
sW:  Volatility of W
sV:    Volatility of V
rVW:  Instantaneous correlation between V and W.
From equation (28.35), the change of numeraire increases the growth rate of V  by aV, 
where
 aV=rVWsVsW (30.4)
If it is assumed that the volatilities and correlation are constant, this means that
 EX1VT2=EY1VT2erVWsVsWT (30.5)
or as an approximation 
EX1VT2=EY1VT211+rVWsVsWT2 (30.6)
These equations can be used to value diff swaps where interest in one currency is 
applied to a principal in another currency.
Example 30.3
Suppose that the current value of the Nikkei stock index is 15,000 yen, the 1-year 
dollar risk-free rate is 5%, the 1-year yen risk-free rate is 2%, and the Nikkei  dividend yield is 1%. The forward price of the Nikkei for a 1-year contract  
denominated in yen can be calculated in the usual way from equation (5.8) as
15,000e10.02-0.012*1=15,150.75
Suppose that the volatility of the index is 20%, the volatility of the 1-year forward 
yen per dollar exchange rate is 12%, and the correlation between the two is 0.3. In  
this case EY1VT2=15,150.75, sV=0.20, sW=0.12 and r=0.3. From equa-
tion ( 30.5), the expected value of the Nikkei in a world defined by a numeraire 
equal to a dollar bond maturing in 1 year is
15,150.75e0.3*0.2*0.12*1=15,260.23
M30_HULL0654_11_GE_C30.indd   712 30/04/2021   17:49Convexity, Timing, and Quanto Adjustments 713
This is the forward price of the Nikkei for a contract that provides a payoff in 
dollars rather than yen. (As an approximation, it is also the futures price of such a contract.)
Using Traditional Risk-Neutral Measures
The numeraire-based measures we have been using work well when payoffs occur at only  
one time. In other situations, it is often more appropriate to use the traditional risk-  
neutral measure. Suppose the process followed by a variable V  in the traditional 
 currency-Y  risk-neutral world is known and we wish to estimate its process in the 
 traditional currency-X  risk-neutral world. Define:
S :  Spot exchange rate (units of Y per unit of X)
sS :  Volatility of S
sV :  Volatility of V
   r :  Instantaneous correlation between S and V.
In this case, the change of numeraire is from the money market account in currency Y to the money market account in currency X (with both money market accounts being denominated in currency X). Define 
gX as the value of the money market account in  
currency X and gY as the value of the money market account in currency Y. The 
numeraire ratio is
gXS>gY
The variables gX1t2 and gY1t2 have a stochastic drift but zero volatility as explained in 
Section 28.4. From Itô’s lemma it follows that the volatility of the numeraire ratio is sS.  
The change of numeraire therefore involves increasing the expected growth rate of V  by
 rsVsS (30.7)
The market price of risk changes from zero to rsS. This result enables what is known as 
Siegel’s paradox to be understood (see Business Snapshot 30.1).
Example 30.4
A 2-year American option provides a payoff of S-K pounds sterling where S is  
the level of the S&P 500 at the time of exercise and K is the strike price. The 
current level of the S&P 500 is 1,200. The risk-free interest rates in sterling and dollars are both constant at 5% and 3%, respectively, the correlation between the  
dollar/sterling exchange rate and the S&P 500 is 0.2, the volatility of the S&P 500 is 25%, and the volatility of the exchange rate is 12%. The dividend yield on the S&P 500 is 1.5%.
This option can be valued by constructing a binomial tree for the S&P 500 
using as the numeraire the money market account in the U.K. (i.e., using the  traditional risk-neutral world as seen from the perspective of a U.K. investor). 
From equation (30.7), the change in numeraire from the U.S. to U.K. money market account leads to an increase in the expected growth rate in the S&P 500 of
0.2*0.25*0.12=0.006
or 0.6%. The growth rate of the S&P 500 using a U.S. dollar numeraire is 
3%-1.5%=1.5%. The growth rate using the sterling numeraire is therefore  
M30_HULL0654_11_GE_C30.indd   713 30/04/2021   17:49714 CHAPTER 30
2.1%. The risk-free interest rate in sterling is 5%. The S&P 500 therefore behaves 
like an asset providing a dividend yield of 5%-2.1%=2.9% under the sterling  
numeraire. Using the parameter values of S=1,200, K=1,200, r=0.05, 
q=0.029, s=0.25, and T=2 with 100 time steps, DerivaGem estimates the 
value of the option as £179.83.
SUMMARY
When valuing a derivative providing a payoff at a particular future time it is natural to  
assume that the variables underlying the derivative equal their forward values and  discount at the rate of interest applicable from the valuation date to the payoff date. 
This chapter has shown that this is not always the correct procedure.
When a payoff depends on a bond yield y observed at time T the expected yield 
should be assumed to be higher than the forward yield as indicated by equation (30.1). This result can be adapted for situations where a payoff depends on a swap rate. When  Business Snapshot 30.1 Siegel’s Paradox
Consider two currencies, X  and Y . Suppose that the interest rates in the two  currencies, 
rX and rY, are constant. Define S  as the number of units of currency Y  per unit of 
 currency X. As explained in Chapter 5, a currency is an asset that provides a yield at the  
foreign risk-free rate. The traditional risk-neutral process for S  is therefore
dS=1rY-rX2S dt+sSS dz
From Itô’s lemma, this implies that the process for 1>S is
d11>S2=1rX-rY+s2
S211>S2 dt-sS11>S2 dz
This leads to what is known as Siegel’s paradox. Since the expected growth rate of S is 
rY-rX in a risk-neutral world, symmetry suggests that the expected growth rate 
of 1>S should be rX-rY rather than rX-rY+s2
S.
To understand Siegel’s paradox it is necessary to appreciate that the process we 
have given for S  is the risk-neutral process for S  in a world where the numeraire is the 
money market account in currency Y . The process for 1>S, because it is deduced from 
the process for S , therefore also assumes that this is the numeraire. Because 1>S is the 
number of units of X per unit of Y, to be symmetrical we should measure the process for 
1>S in a world where the numeraire is the money market account in currency X. 
Equation (30.7) shows that when we change the numeraire, from the money market account in currency Y to the money market account in currency X, the growth rate of a variable V increases by 
rsVsS, where r is the correlation between S and V. In this 
case, V=1>S, so that r=-1 and sV=sS. It follows that the change of numeraire 
causes the growth rate of 1>S to increase by -s2
S. This neutralizes the +s2
S in the 
process given above for 1>S. The process for 1>S in a world where the numeraire is 
the money market account in currency X is therefore
d11>S2=1rX-rY211>S2 dt-sS11>S2 dz
This is symmetrical with the process we started with for S. The paradox is resolved!

a variable is observed at time T  but the payoff occurs at a later time T * the forward 
value of the variable should be adjusted as indicated by equation (30.3). When a 
 variable is observed in one currency but leads to a payoff in another currency the 
 forward value of the variable should also be adjusted. In this case the adjustment is 
shown in equation (30.5).
These results can be used when nonstandard swaps are valued.

Practice Questions
 30.1. The payoff from a forward contract is delayed by two years. Explain how the impact of 
the delay on value is affected by the correlation between the price of the underlying asset and interest rates.
 30.2. Explain whether any convexity or timing adjustments are necessary when:
(a) We wish to value a spread option that pays off every quarter the excess (if any) of the 
5-year swap rate over the 3-month compounded SOFR applied to a principal of $100. The payoff occurs 90 days after the rates are observed.
(b) We wish to value a derivative that pays off every quarter the 3-month compounded SOFR minus the 3-month Treasury bill rate. The payoff occurs 90 days after the rates  
are observed.
 30.3. Suppose that in Example 29.3 of Section 29.2 the payoff occurs after 1 year (i.e., when the interest rate is observed) rather than in 15 months. What difference does this make to the inputs to Black’s model?
 30.4. The OIS zero curve is flat at 10% per annum with annual compounding. Calculate the value of an instrument where, in 5 years’ time, the 2-year OIS swap rate (with annual  payments and compounding) is received and a fixed rate of 10% is paid. Both are 
applied to a notional principal of $100. Assume that the volatility of the forward swap rate is 20%. Explain why the value of the instrument is different from zero.
 30.5. What difference does it make in Problem 30.4 if the swap rate is observed in 5 years but the  
exchange of payments takes place in (a) 6 years, and (b) 7 years? Assume that the  volatilities of all forward rates are 20% and also that the forward swap rate for the period  
between years 5 and 7 has a correlation of 0.8 with the forward interest rate between years 
5 and 6 and a correlation of 0.95 with the forward interest rate between years 5 and 7.
 30.6. The price of a bond at time T, measured in terms of its yield, is 
G1yT2. Assume geometric 
Brownian motion for the forward bond yield y in a world that is defined by a numeraire equal to a bond maturing at time T. Suppose that the growth rate of the forward bond 
yield is 
a and its volatility is sy :
M30_HULL0654_11_GE_C30.indd   715 30/04/2021   17:49716 CHAPTER 30
(a) Use Itô’s lemma to calculate the process for the forward bond price in terms of a, 
sy, y, and G (y).
(b) The forward bond price should follow a martingale in the world considered. Use 
this fact to calculate an expression for a.
(c) Show that the expression for a is, to a first approximation, consistent with  
equation (30.1).
 30.7.  The variable S is an investment asset providing income at rate q measured in currency A. 
It follows the process
dS=mSS dt+sSS dz
in the real world. Defining new variables as necessary, give the process followed by S , 
and the corresponding market price of risk, in:
(a) A world that is the traditional risk-neutral world for currency A
(b) A world that is the traditional risk-neutral world for currency B
(c) A world that is defined by a numeraire equal to a zero-coupon currency A bond 
maturing at time T
(d) A world that is defined by a numeraire equal to a zero-coupon currency B bond maturing at time T.
 30.8. A call option provides a payoff at time T of 
max1ST-K, 02 yen, where ST is the dollar 
price of gold at time T and K is the strike price. Assuming that the storage costs of gold are zero and defining other variables as necessary, calculate the value of the contract.
 30.9. A Canadian equity index is 400. The Canadian dollar is currently worth 0.70 U.S.  dollars. The risk-free interest rates in Canada and the U.S. are constant at 6% and 4%, 
respectively. The dividend yield on the index is 3%. Define Q  as the number of Canadian 
dollars per U.S. dollar and S  as the value of the index. The volatility of S  is 20%, the 
volatility of Q  is 6%, and the correlation between S  and Q  is 0.4. Use DerivaGem to 
determine the value of a 2-year American-style call option on the index if:
(a) It pays off in Canadian dollars the amount by which the index exceeds 400.
(b) It pays off in U.S. dollars the amount by which the index exceeds 400.
 30.10. Consider an instrument that will pay off S dollars in 2 years, where S is the value of the 
Nikkei index. The index is currently 20,000. The yen/dollar exchange rate is 100 (yen per 
dollar). The correlation between the exchange rate and the index is 0.3 and the dividend yield on the index is 1% per annum. The volatility of the Nikkei index is 20% and the volatility of the yen/dollar exchange rate is 12%. The interest rates (assumed constant) in the U.S. and Japan are 4% and 2%, respectively.
(a) What is the value of the instrument?
(b) Suppose that the exchange rate at some point during the life of the instrument is Q 
and the level of the index is S. Show that a U.S. investor can create a portfolio that 
changes in value by approximately 
∆S dollar when the index changes in value by 
∆S yen by investing S dollars in the Nikkei and shorting SQ yen.
(c) Confirm that this is correct by supposing that the index changes from 20,000  
to 20,050 and the exchange rate changes from 100 to 99.7.
(d) How would you delta hedge the instrument under consideration?
 30.11. Suppose that the risk-free yield curve is flat at 8% (with continuous compounding). The 
payoff from a derivative occurs in 4 years. It is equal to the 5-year rate minus the 2-year  
rate at this time, applied to a principal of $100 with both rates being continuously  compounded. (The payoff can be positive or negative.) Calculate the value of the 
M30_HULL0654_11_GE_C30.indd   716 30/04/2021   17:49Convexity, Timing, and Quanto Adjustments 717
 derivative. Assume that the volatility for all rates is 25%. What difference does it make  
if the payoff occurs in 5 years instead of 4 years? Assume all rates are perfectly  
correlated.
 30.12. Suppose that the payoff from a derivative will occur in 10 years and will equal the 3-year 
U.S. dollar swap rate for a semiannual-pay swap observed at that time applied to a  
certain principal. Assume that the swap yield curve is flat at 8% (semiannually  compounded) per annum in dollars and 3% (semiannually compounded) in yen. The  
forward swap rate volatility is 18%, the volatility of the 10-year “yen per dollar”  
forward exchange rate is 12%, and the correlation between this exchange rate and 
U.S. dollar interest rates is 0.25. What is the value of the derivative if the swap rate is applied to a principal of (a) $100 million with a dollar payoff and (b) 100 million yen with a yen payoff? Assume that risk-free rates are 2% in yen and 6% in dollars (both semiannually compounded).

APPENDIX 
PROOF OF THE CONVEXITY ADJUSTMENT FORMULA
This appendix calculates a convexity adjustment for forward bond yields. Suppose  
that the payoff from a derivative at time T depends on a bond yield observed at that 
time. Define:
yF : Forward bond yield observed today for a forward contract with maturity T
yT : Bond yield at time T
BT : Price of the bond at time T
sy : Volatility of the forward bond yield.
Suppose that the relationship between a bond price and its yield is
BT=G1yT2
Expanding G1yT2 in a Taylor series about yT=yF yields the following approximation:
BT=G1yF2+1yT-yF2G/uni20321yF2+0.51yT-yF22G/uni20331yF2
where G/uni2032 and G/uni2033 are the first and second partial derivatives of G . Taking expectations in 
a world defined by a numeraire equal to a zero-coupon bond maturing at time T gives
ET1BT2=G1yF2+ET1yT-yF2G/uni20321yF2+1
2ET31yT-yF224G/uni20331yF2
where ET denotes expectations in this world. The expression G1yF2 is by definition the 
forward bond price. Also, because of the particular world we are working in, ET1BT2 
equals the forward bond price. Hence ET 1BT2=G1yF2, so that
ET 1yT-yF2G/uni20321yF2+1
2ET31yT-yF224G/uni20331yF2=0
The expression ET31yT-yF224 is approximately s2
yy2FT. Hence it is approximately true 
that
ET 1yT2=yF-1
2 y2
F s2yT G/uni20331yF2
G/uni20321yF2
This shows that, to obtain the expected bond yield in a world defined by a numeraire 
equal to a zero-coupon bond maturing at time T, the term
-1
2 y2
F s2yT G/uni20331yF2
G/uni20321yF2
should be added to the forward bond yield. This is the result in equation (30.1). For an 
alternative proof, see Problem 30.6.

Equilibrium 
Models of the 
Short Rate31 CHAPTER  
In this chapter, we consider how models of the term structure of risk-free interest rates 
can be constructed in both the real world and the risk-neutral world. We first show that  
when a Markov process for the short rate has been specified in the traditional risk- neutral world all rates can, at least in theory, be calculated at all times as a function of  
the short rate. We will spend some time studying two popular one-factor Markov models of the short rate: the Vasicek model and the Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross model. These are relatively simple models which lead to analytic formulas for determining bond prices.
The difference between the behavior of the short rate in the real world and the risk-  
neutral world is determined by the market price of interest rate risk. We explained the meaning of the term “market price of risk” in Section 28.1. The market price of risk for a bond is positive. Since interest rates and bond prices are negatively related, the market price of risk for an interest rate is negative. This means that the drift of an interest rate is greater in the risk-neutral world than in the real world. The expected future value of an interest rate is therefore greater in the risk-neutral world than in the real world.
The equilibrium models considered in this chapter can approximately match the 
today’s term structure of interest rates, but they do not provide an exact match.  However, when Monte Carlo simulation is being carried out over a long period of 
time for the purposes of scenario analysis, the models can be useful tools. For  example, 
a pension fund or an insurance company that is interested in the performance of its investments over the next 20 years is likely to feel that an approximate fit to today’s term structure is adequate.
In the next chapter, we extend the material in this chapter to consider short-rate 
models that are designed to exactly fit today’s term structure of interest rates. These are used to value interest rate derivatives. In Chapter 33, we consider models of forward rates that also provide an exact fit to today’s term structure.
31.1 BACKGROUND
The risk-free short rate, r, at time t is the rate that applies to an infinitesimally short 
period of time at time t. It is sometimes referred to as the instantaneous short rate. Bond prices, option prices, and other derivative prices depend only on the process followed by r  
M31_HULL0654_11_GE_C31.indd   719 30/04/2021   17:49720 CHAPTER 31
in the traditional risk-neutral world. As explained in Chapter 28, the traditional risk-  
neutral world is a world where, in a very short time period between t  and t+∆t, investors 
earn on average r1t2∆t. All risk-neutral processes for r that will be considered in this 
chapter are processes in this traditional risk-neutral world.
From equation (28.19), the value at time t  of an interest rate derivative that provides a 
payoff of fT at time T is
 En3e-r1T-t2 fT4 (31.1)
where r is the average value of r in the time interval between t and T, and En denotes 
expected value in the traditional risk-neutral world.
As usual, define P1t, T2 as the price at time t  of a risk-free zero-coupon bond that pays 
off $1 at time T. From equation (31.1),
 P1t, T2=En3e-r1T-t24 (31.2)
If R1t, T2 is the continuously compounded risk-free interest rate at time t for a term of 
T-t, then
P1t, T2=e-R1t, T21T-t2
so that
 R1t, T2=-1
T-t ln P1t, T2 (31.3)
and, from equation (31.2), 
R1t, T2=-1
T-t ln En3e-r1T-t24 (31.4)
This equation enables the term structure of interest rates at any given time to be 
obtained from the risk-neutral process for r. It shows that, once the process for r has been defined, everything about the initial zero curve and its evolution through time can be determined.
Suppose the risk-neutral process for r is Markov with one factor:
dr=m1r, t2 dt+s1r, t2 dz
From Itô’s lemma, any derivative dependent on r follows the process
df=a0 f
0 t+m0 f
0 r+1
2s20 2f
0 r2b dt+s0 f
0 r dz
Because we are working in the traditional risk-neutral world, if the derivative provides no income, this process must have the form
d f=r f dt+g
so that
0  f
0 t+m0  f
0 r+1
2s20 2 f
0 r2=r f
This is the equivalent of the Black–Scholes–Merton differential equation for interest rate derivatives. One particular solution to the equation must be the zero-coupon bond price 
P1t, T2.
M31_HULL0654_11_GE_C31.indd   720 30/04/2021   17:49Equilibrium Models of the Short Rate 721
Hence
 0  P1t, T2
0  t+m0  P1t, T2
0  r+1
2s20  2P1t, T2
0  r2=rP1t, T2 (31.5)
It is tempting to suggest a simple model where the term structure is always flat. All zero- 
coupon interest rates are then r , so that P1t, T2=e-r1t21T-t2 at all times. However, this is 
not a valid stochastic model for bond prices because it cannot satisfy equation (31.5) for all T unless m and s are both zero.
31.2 ONE-FACTOR MODELS
Equilibrium models usually start with assumptions about economic variables and derive a process for the short rate, r. They then explore what the process for r implies about bond prices and option prices.
In a one-factor equilibrium model, the process for r involves only one source of 
uncertainty. Usually the process for the short rate is assumed to be stationary in the sense that the parameters of the process are not functions of time. This means that the process we considered earlier can be written as
dr=m1r2 dt+s1r2 dz
The assumption of a single factor is not as restrictive as it might appear. A one-factor 
model implies that all rates move in the same direction over any short time interval, but not that they all move by the same amount. The shape of the zero curve can therefore change with the passage of time.
This section considers three one-factor equilibrium models:
m1r2=mr; s1r2=sr (Rendleman and Bartter model)
m1r2=a1b-r2; s1r2=s (Vasicek model)
m1r2=a1b-r2; s1r2=s1r (Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross model)
The Rendleman and Bartter Model
In Rendleman and Bartter’s model, the risk-neutral process for r is1
dr=mr dt+sr dz
where m and s are constants. This means that r  follows geometric Brownian motion. The 
process for r  is of the same type as that assumed for a stock price in Chapter 15. It can be 
represented using a binomial tree similar to the one used for stocks in Chapter 13.
The assumption that the short-term interest rate behaves like a stock price is a  natural 
starting point but is less than ideal. One important difference between interest rates and stock prices is that interest rates appear to be pulled back to some long-run average level  
over time. This phenomenon is known as mean reversion. When r  is high, mean 
 reversion tends to cause it to have a negative drift; when r is low, mean reversion tends 
to cause it to have a positive drift. Mean reversion is illustrated in Figure 31.1. The Rendleman and Bartter model does not incorporate mean reversion.
1 See R. Rendleman and B. Bartter, “The Pricing of Options on Debt Securities,” Journal of Financial and 
Quantitative Analysis, 15 (March 1980): 11–24.
M31_HULL0654_11_GE_C31.indd   721 30/04/2021   17:49722 CHAPTER 31
There are compelling economic arguments in favor of mean reversion. When rates are  
high, the economy tends to slow down and there is low demand for funds from  
 borrowers. As a result, rates decline. When rates are low, there tends to be a high demand 
for funds on the part of borrowers and rates tend to rise.
The Vasicek Model
In Vasicek’s model, the risk-neutral process for r is
dr=a1b-r2 dt+s dz
where a, b, and s are nonnegative constants.2 This model incorporates mean reversion. 
The short rate is pulled to a “reversion level” b at “reversion rate” a. Superimposed upon this pull is a normally distributed stochastic term 
s dz.
Zero-coupon bond prices in Vasicek’s model are given by
 P1t, T2=A1t, T2e-B1t, T2r1t2 (31.6)
where

To see this, note that m=a1b-r2 and s=s in differential equation (31.5), so that
0  P1t, T2
0  t+a1b-r20  P1t, T2
0  r+1
2s20  2P1t, T2
0  r2=rP1t, T2
By substitution, we see that P1t, T2=A1t, T2e-B1t, T2r satisfies this differential equation 
when
Bt-aB+1=0
and
At-abAB+1
2s2AB2=0
where subscripts denote derivatives. The expressions for A1t, T2 and B1t, T2 in equa- 
tions (31.7) and (31.8) are solutions to these equations. What is more, because  
A1T, T2=1 and B1T, T2=0, the boundary condition P1T, T2=1 is satisfied.
The Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross Model
Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (CIR) have proposed the following alternative model:3
dr=a1b-r2 dt+s1r dz
where a, b, and s are nonnegative constants. This has the same mean-reverting drift as 
Vasicek, but the standard deviation of the change in the short rate in a short period of  
time is proportional to 1r. This means that, as the short-term interest rate increases, the 
standard deviation increases.
Bond prices in the CIR model have the same general form as those in Vasicek’s 
model,
P1t, T2=A1t, T2e-B1t, T2r1t2
but the functions B1t, T2 and A1t, T2 are different:
B1t, T2=21eg1T-t2-12
1g+a21eg1T-t2-12+2g
and
A1t, T2=c2ge1a+g21T-t2>2
1g+a21eg1T-t2-12+2gd2ab>s2
with g=2a2+2s2.
To see this result, substitute m=a1b-r2 and s=s1r into differential equation (31.5) 
to get
0   P1t, T2
0  t+a1b-r20   P1t, T2
0  r+1
2s2r0  2 P1t, T2
0  r2=r P1t, T2
As in the case of Vasicek’s model, we can prove the bond-pricing result by substituting 
P1t, T2=A1t, T2e-B1t, T2r into the differential equation. In this case, A1t, T2 and B1t, T2 
are solutions of
Bt-aB-1
2s2B2+1=0, At-abAB=0
Furthermore, the boundary condition P1T, T2=1 is satisfied.

Properties of Vasicek and CIR
The A1t, T2 and B1t, T2 functions are different for Vasicek and CIR, but for both 
 models
P1t, T2=A1t, T2e-B1t, T2r1t2
so that
 0   P1t, T2
0  r1t2=-B1t, T2P1t, T2 (31.9)
From equation (31.3), the zero rate at time t for a period of T-t is
 R1t, T2=-1
T-t ln A1t, T2+1
T-t B1t, T2r1t2 (31.10)
This shows that the entire term structure at time t can be determined as a function of 
r(t) once a, b, and s have been chosen. The rate R1t, T2 is linearly dependent on r(t). 
This means that the value of r(t) determines the level of the term structure at time t. As shown in Figure 31.2, the shape at a particular time can be upward sloping, downward sloping, or slightly “humped.”
One difference between Vasicek and CIR is that in Vasicek the short rate, r(t), can 
become negative whereas in CIR this is not possible. If 
2abÚs2 in CIR, r(t) is never 
zero; otherwise it occasionally touches zero.

From Chapter 4, the duration D of a bond that has a price of Q is given by
D=-1
Q0  Q
0  y so that ∆Q
Q=-D ∆y
where y is the continuously compounded bond yield. An alternative duration measure 
Dn, which can be used in conjunction with Vasicek or CIR, is defined as follows:
Dn=-1
Q0  Q
0  r so that ∆Q
Q=-Dn ∆r
Here we are measuring the sensitivity of the bond price to the short rate rather than to its 
yield. Equation (31.9) shows that when we consider a T -maturity zero-coupon bond so 
that Q=P1t, T2, the alternative duration measure, Dn, is equal to B1t, T2.
Example 31.1
Consider a zero-coupon bond lasting 4 years. In this case, D = 4, so that a 10-basis- 
point (0.1% or 0.001) increase in the bond’s yield leads to a decrease of approxi-mately 0.4% in the bond price. If Vasicek’s model is used with 
a=0.1,
Dn=B10, 42=11-e-0.1*42
0.1=3.30
This means that a 10-basis-point increase in the short rate leads to a decrease in the bond price that is approximately 0.33%. The change in the bond price from a  
certain movement in the short rate is less than that from the same movement in its yield because of the impact of mean reversion.
When Q is the price of a coupon-bearing bond that provides a cash flow 
ci at time Ti,
Dn=-1
Q0   Q
0  r=-1
Qan
i=1ci0  P1t, Ti2
0  r=an
i=1ciP1t, Ti2
Q Dni
where Dni=B1t, Ti2 is the Dn for P1t, Ti2. This shows that the Dn for a coupon-bearing 
bond can be calculated as a weighted average of the Dn’s for the underlying zero-coupon 
bonds, similarly to the way the usual duration measure D is calculated (see Table 4.6). This analysis can be extended to cover convexity measures (see Problem 31.11).
The Bond Price Process
The expected growth rate of P1t, T2 in the traditional risk-neutral world at time t is r(t) 
because P1t, T2 is the price of a traded security that provides no income. Since P1t, T2 is a 
function of r(t), the coefficient of dz(t) in the process for P1t, T2 can be calculated from  
Itô’s lemma as s0  P1t, T2>0  r1t2 for Vasicek and s2r1t20   P1t, T2>0  r1t2 for CIR. Substitut-
ing from equation (31.9), the processes for P1t, T2 in a risk-neutral world are therefore
 Vasicek: d P1t, T2=r1t2 P1t, T2 dt-sBvas1t, T2 P1t, T2 dz1t2 (31.11)
 CIR: d P1t, T2=r1t2 P1t, T2 dt-s2r1t2 Bcir1t, T2 P1t, T2 dz1t2 (31.12)
where the subscripts to B indicate the model it applies to.
To compare the term structure of interest rates given by Vasicek and CIR for a 
particular value of r, it makes sense to use the same a and b. However, the Vasicek s  
M31_HULL0654_11_GE_C31.indd   725 30/04/2021   17:49726 CHAPTER 31
Bonds have a positive market price of risk (i.e., positive systematic risk), so investors 
require an extra return over the risk-free rate for investing in bonds. Interest rates are negatively related to bond prices and therefore have negative market prices of risk.
Suppose that 
l is the (negative) market price of risk of the short rate, r. If the risk- 
neutral process for r is
dr=m1r2 dt+s1r2 dz
the real-world process, from Chapter 28, is
dr=3m1r2+ls1r24 dt+s1r2 dz
In the case of Vasicek’s model, the risk-neutral process is
dr=a1b-r2 dt+s dz
so that the real-world process is
dr=3a1b-r2+ls4 dt+s dz
Assuming l is constant, this process is
 dr=3a1b*-r24 dt+s dz (31.13)
where b*=b+ls>a. The real-world process is therefore the same as the risk-neutral 
process except that the reversion level is lower (because l is negative).
In the case of CIR, the risk-neutral process is
dr=a1b-r2 dt+s1r dz
It is convenient to assume that l=k1r, where k is a (negative) constant, so that the 
real-world process is
dr=3a1b-r2+ksr4 dt+s1r dz
In this case,
dr=a*1b*-r2 dt+s1r dz
where a*=a-ks and b*=ab>a*. The real-world process is therefore the same as the  
risk-neutral process except that the reversion rate is higher and the reversion level is lower.
Next, consider bonds. Equation (31.11) gives the risk-neutral process in Vasicek’s 
model for a zero-coupon bond. When the market price of risk of the short rate is 
l, the 
real-world process is
d P1t, T2=3r1t2-lsBvas1t, T24 P1t, T2 dt-sBvas1t, T2 P1t, T2 dz1t2
Equation (31.12) gives the risk-neutral process in the CIR model for a zero-coupon should be chosen to be approximately equal to the CIR s times 2r1t2. For example, if  
r is 4% and s is 0.01 in Vasicek, an appropriate value for s in CIR would be 
0.01>20.04=0.05. Software for experimenting with the models can be found at 
www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull/VasicekCIR.
31.3 REAL-WORLD VS. RISK-NEUTRAL PROCESSES
M31_HULL0654_11_GE_C31.indd   726 30/04/2021   17:49Equilibrium Models of the Short Rate 727
We will illustrate the estimation of parameters with Vasicek’s model. The discrete 
 version of the model in the real world is, from equation (31.13),
∆r=a1b*-r2∆t+sP2∆t
where P is a random sample from a standard normal distribution. Define r i as the rate 
on day i. Daily data on 3-month Treasury rates in the United States between January 4, 
1982, and August 23, 2016, together with a worksheet for the analysis in this section, is  
on www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull/VasicekCIR. When we use this data to regress 
ri+1-ri against ri, we obtain
ri+1-ri=0.00000915-0.000545ri
with a standard error of 0.000754.
We have about 250 observations per year, so that ∆t=1>250. Because 0.00000915 = 
0.00229>250, 0.000545 = 0.136>250, and 0.000754=0.0119>2250, the regression result 
is equivalent to
∆r=10.00229-0.136r2∆t+0.0119P2∆t
or
∆r=0.13610.0168-r2∆t+0.0119P2∆t
indicating that the best-fit parameters are a=0.136, b*=0.0168 (or 1.68%), and 
s=0.0119 (or 1.19%). Problem 31.15 shows that the same results are obtained using 
maximum-likelihood methods.
So far we have estimated the parameters for Vasicek’s model in the real world. If the 
market price of risk is l, the previous section shows that in the risk-neutral world the 
parameters are a=0.136, b=0.168-0.0119l>a, and s=0.0119. For a trial value of 
l, we can use equations (31.7), (31.8), and (31.10) to estimate zero-coupon rates as a 
function of maturity. Solver can then be used to determine the value of l that minimizes 
the sum of squared errors between the zero-coupon rates given by the model and those in the market. This best-fit value of 
l turns out to be -0.175.4 Table 31.1 compares the 
zero-coupon rates given by the model when this best-fit value of l is used with those in 
the market. Problem 31.16 uses the same data for the CIR model.
The two-step estimation procedure we have used is a simple procedure and there has 
been no attempt to fit the term structure of interest rates at times other than today. In  practice, researchers use more sophisticated econometric procedures. The parameters  
we have estimated for Vasicek’s model are reasonable, but this will not always be the case.

31.4 ESTIMATING PARAMETERS
4 Research such as R. Stanton, “A Nonparametric Model of Term Structure Dynamics and the Market Price 
of Interest Rate Risk,” Journal of Finance, 52, 5 (December 1997): 1973–2002, has tried to estimate the market 
price of risk from the average slope of the term structure of interest rates at the short end. As explained in  
J. C. Hull, A. Sokol, and A. White, “Short-Rate Joint-Measure Models,” Risk, 15, 3 (2015): 59–63, this tends to produce values for the market price of risk that are much too negative (typically 
-1.0 or less).
5 As Problem 31.16 shows, the results using the same data for the CIR model are not as reasonable.
M31_HULL0654_11_GE_C31.indd   727 30/04/2021   17:49728 CHAPTER 31
The period of time over which parameters are estimated and the current shape of the 
term structure can have a big effect on the results obtained. Some judgment is necessary to determine the most appropriate data to use when a model such as Vasicek or CIR is estimated in practice.Maturity

31.5 MORE SOPHISTICATED MODELS
The Vasicek and CIR models are simple one-factor Markov models of the short rate. A two-factor Markov model of the short rate that is an extension of Vasicek is
6
 dr=1u-ar2 dt+s1 dz1
 du=-bu dt+s2 dz2
In this model, the reversion level 1= u>a2 is not constant. It follows a stochastic process. 
However, bond prices are analytic:
P1t, T2=A1t, T2e-B1t, T2r-C1t, T2u
where B1t, T2 is the same as in the Vasicek model and
 C1t, T2=1
a1a-b2e-a1T-t2-1
b1a-b2e-b1T-t2+1
ab (31.14)
The function A1t, T2 is more complex (see Technical Note 14 on the author’s website).
Another two-factor model which has analytic bond prices and involves similar 
 processes to CIR was developed by Longstaff and Schwartz.7 Other multifactor models  
are sometimes used in practice to describe the real-world evolution of the term 
 structure. In Chapter 33, we will describe how general risk-neutral models can be 
 developed in terms of forward rates.

SUMMARY
When a Markov model of the (instantaneous) short rate has been specified, the current 
value of the short rate determines the whole term structure of interest rates as a function of the level of the short rate. It is therefore tempting to model the term structure of interest rates by specifying a process for the short rate. Two popular models are the Vasicek and Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (CIR) models. In both models the short rate  
follows a mean-reverting process (i.e., it is pulled back toward a central value) and has some uncertainty superimposed on the mean reversion. In the case of Vasicek, the uncertain component of the change over a short period of time of length 
∆t always 
has zero mean and a constant standard deviation; in CIR, the uncertain component has zero mean and a standard deviation proportional to the square root of the short rate. In  
Vasicek, rates can become negative; in CIR, this is not possible. In both models the bond  
price 
P1t, T2 has the form A1t, T2e-B1t, T2r, but the A1t, T2 and B1t, T2 functions in the two 
models are not the same.
The market price of interest rate risk is negative. If the market price of risk in Vasicek 
is constant, the process followed by the short rate in the real world is the same as that in the risk-neutral world except that the reversion level is lower. If the market price of risk in CIR is proportional to the square root of the short rate, the process in the real world has the same form as that in the risk-neutral world except that the reversion rate is higher and the reversion level is lower.
The models we have considered in this chapter do not provide an exact fit to the 
 current term structure of interest rates but are useful for simulating the behavior of  
interest rates in some situations. When derivatives are being valued it is usually 
 necessary to use a model that provides an exact fit to the current term structure of 
interest rates. Short-rate models that do this are considered in the next chapter and more general models that describe the behavior of forward rates are in Chapter 33.

 process. Derive the relationship between (a) the real-world reversion rate and the risk- 
neutral reversion rate and (b) the real-world reversion level and the risk-neutral  reversion level.

correctly predicts the effect of an increase in r to 1.05%.
 31.9. Suppose that a=0.1 and b=0.1 and in both the Vasicek and the Cox, Ingersoll, Ross 
model. In both models, the initial short rate is 10% and the initial standard deviation of the short-rate change in a short time

models for a zero-coupon bond that matures in year 10.
 31.10. Suppose the short rate r is 4% and its real-world process is dr=0.110.05-r2 dt+0.01 dz,

 31.13.  Suppose that the market price of risk of the short rate is l1>1r+l21r. Show that if the 
real world process for the short rate is the one assumed by CIR, the risk-neutral process  
has the same functional form. Derive the relationship between (a) the real-world

 31.14. In the two-factor extension of Vasicek given in Section 31.5, derive the differential  
equation which must be satisfied by a bond price, P1t, T2. Use this to derive differential  
equations that must be satisfied by A1t, T2, B1t, T2, and C1t, T2 in P1t, T2 = 
A1t, T2e-B1t, T2r-C1t, T2u. Show that the expressions given for B1t, T2 in equation (31.7) 
and C1t, T2 in equation (31.14) satisfy these equations. [Hint: Use equation (14A.10)  
to obtain the drift of P1t, T2 and set this drift equal to rP1t, T2.]
 31.15. Use the result in Problem 31.7 to determine the best fit parameters for the Vasicek  
model using the same data as in Section 31.4 (see www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull/
VasicekCIR). Verify that the regression approach in Section 31.4 and the maximum- likelihood approach give the same answer.
 31.16. What is the result corresponding to that given in Problem 31.7 for the CIR model? Use 
maximum likelihood methods to estimate the a, b, and 
s parameters for the CIR model  
using the same data as that used for the Vasicek model in Section 31.4 (see  
www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull/VasicekCIR). Setting the market price of risk equal  
to k1r use the market data in Table 31.1 to estimate the best fit k.

No-Arbitrage 
Models of the 
Short Rate
The disadvantage of the equilibrium models presented in Chapter 31 is that they do not 
automatically fit today’s term structure of interest rates. By choosing the parameters judiciously, they can be made to provide an approximate fit to many of the term  
structures that are encountered in practice. But the fit is not an exact one. Most traders,  
when they are valuing derivatives, find this unsatisfactory. Not unreasonably, they argue that they can have very little confidence in the price of a bond option when the model used does not price the underlying bond correctly. A 1% error in the price of the  
underlying bond may lead to a 25% error in an option price.
A no-arbitrage model is a model designed to be exactly consistent with today’s term 
structure of interest rates. The essential difference between an equilibrium and a no- arbitrage model is therefore as follows. In an equilibrium model, today’s term structure of interest rates is an output. In a no-arbitrage model, today’s term structure of interest rates is an input.
In an equilibrium model, the drift of the short rate is not usually a function of time. In  
a no-arbitrage model, the drift is, in general, dependent on time. This is because the shape of the initial zero curve governs the average path taken by the short rate in the future in a no-arbitrage model. If the zero curve is steeply upward-sloping for maturities  
between 
t1 and t2, then r has a positive drift between these times; if it is steeply  
downward-sloping for these maturities, then r has a negative drift between these times.32 CHAPTER  
1 See T. S. Y. Ho and S.-B. Lee, “Term Structure Movements and Pricing Interest Rate Contingent Claims,” 
Journal of Finance, 41 (December 1986): 1011–29.It turns out that some equilibrium models can be converted to no-arbitrage models by including a function of time in the drift of the short rate. Here, we consider the Ho–Lee, Hull–White (one- and two-factor), Black–Derman–Toy, and Black–Karasinski models.
The Ho–Lee Model
Ho and Lee proposed the first no-arbitrage model of the term structure in a paper in 1986.
1 They presented the model in the form of a binomial tree of bond prices with two 32.1 EXTENSIONS OF EQUILIBRIUM MODELS
M32_HULL0654_11_GE_C32.indd   732 30/04/2021   17:50No-Arbitrage Models of the Short Rate 733
parameters: the short-rate standard deviation and the market price of risk of the short  
rate. It has since been shown that the continuous-time limit of the model in the 
 traditional risk-neutral world is
 dr=u1t2 dt+s dz (32.1)
where s, the instantaneous standard deviation of the short rate, is constant and u1t2 is a  
function of time chosen to ensure that the model fits the initial term structure. The 
variable u1t2 defines the average direction that r moves at time t. This is independent of 
the level of r. The market price of risk, which determines behavior in the real world, is irrelevant when the model is used to price interest rate derivatives.
Technical Note 31 at www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull/TechnicalNotes shows that
 
u1t2=Ft10, t2+s2t (32.2)
where F10, t2 is the instantaneous forward rate for a maturity t as seen at time zero and 
the subscript t denotes a partial derivative with respect to t. As an approximation, u1t2 
equals Ft10, t2. This means that the average direction that the short rate will be moving in  
the future is approximately equal to the slope of the instantaneous forward curve. The Ho–Lee model is illustrated in Figure 32.1. Superimposed on the average movement in 
the short rate is the normally distributed random outcome.
Technical Note 31 also shows that
 
P1t, T2=A1t, T2e-r1t21T-t2 (32.3)

gives the price of a zero-coupon bond at a future time t in terms of the short rate at  
time t and the prices of bonds today.
The Hull–White One-Factor Model
In a paper published in 1990, Hull and White explored extensions of the Vasicek model 
that provide an exact fit to the initial term structure.2 One version of the extended 
Vasicek model that they consider is
 dr=3u1t2-ar4 dt+s dz (32.4)
or
dr=acu1t2
a-rddt+s dz
where a and s are constants. This is known as the Hull–White model. It can be  
characterized as the Ho–Lee model with mean reversion at rate a. Alternatively, it  
can be characterized as the Vasicek model with a time-dependent reversion level. At 
time t, the short rate reverts to u1t2>a at rate a . The Ho–Lee model is a particular case of 
the Hull–White model with a=0.
The model has the same amount of analytic tractability as Ho–Lee. Technical Note 31 
shows that
 u1t2=Ft10, t2+aF10, t2+s2

The last term in this equation is usually fairly small. If we ignore it, the equation implies 
that the drift of the process for r at time t is Ft10, t2+a3F10, t2-r4. This shows that, on 
average, r follows the slope of the initial instantaneous forward rate curve. When it  
deviates from that curve, it reverts back to it at rate a. The model is illustrated in  
Figure 32.2.
Technical Note 31 shows that bond prices at time t in the Hull–White model are 
given by
 P1t, T2=A1t, T2e-B1t, T2r1t2 (32.6)

As we show in the next section, European bond options can be valued analytically  
using the Ho–Lee and Hull–White models. A method for representing the models in the 
form of a trinomial tree is given later in this chapter. This is useful when American options and other derivatives that cannot be valued analytically are considered.
The Black–Derman–Toy Model
In 1990, Black, Derman, and Toy proposed a binomial-tree model for a lognormal  
short-rate process.3 Their procedure for building the binomial tree is explained in  
Technical Note 23 at www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull/TechnicalNotes. It can be  
shown that the stochastic process corresponding to the model is
d ln r=3u1t2-a1t2 ln r4 dt+s1t2 dz
with
a1t2=-s/uni20321t2
s1t2
where s/uni20321t2 is the derivative of s with respect to t. This model has the property that 
the interest rate cannot become negative. The Wiener process dz can cause ln(r ) to be 
negative, but r  itself is always positive. One disadvan tage of the model is that there 
are no analytic properties. A more serious disadvantage is that the way the tree is con-structed imposes a relationship between the volatility parameter 
s1t2 and the reversion 
rate parameter a(t). The reversion rate is positive only if the volatility of the short rate is a decreasing function of time.
In practice, the most useful version of the model is when 
s1t2 is constant. The  
parameter a is then zero, so that there is no mean reversion and the model reduces to
d ln r=u1t2 dt+s dz
This can be characterized as a lognormal version of the Ho–Lee model.

Treasury Bond Prices,” Financial Analysts Journal, January/February (1990): 33–39.

The Black–Karasinski Model
In 1991, Black and Karasinski developed an extension of the Black–Derman–Toy  
model where the reversion rate and volatility are determined independently of each 
other.4 The most general version of the model is
d ln r=3u1t2-a1t2 ln r4 dt+s1t2 dz
The model is the same as Black–Derman–Toy model except that there is no relation between a(t) and 
s1t2. In practice, a (t) and s1t2 are often assumed to be constant, so that 
the model becomes
 d ln r=3u1t2-a ln r4 dt+s dz (32.9)
As in the case of all the models we are considering, the u1t2 function is determined to  
provide an exact fit to the initial term structure of interest rates. The model has no  
analytic tractability, but later in this chapter we will describe a convenient way of  
simultaneously determining u1t2 and representing the process for r in the form of a 
trinomial tree.
The Hull–White Two-Factor Model
In Section 31.4, we presented a two-factor equilibrium model which is an extension of 
Vasicek’s model. Hull and White show how this model can be converted into a no- arbitrage model by adding 
u1t2 in the drift of r.5
This model provides a richer pattern of term structure movements and a richer  
pattern of volatilities than one-factor models of r. For more information on the  
analytical properties of the model and the way a tree can be constructed for it, see Technical Note 14 at www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull/TechnicalNotes.

Analysts Journal, July/August (1991): 52–59.

Factor Models,” Journal of Derivatives, 2, 2 (Winter 1994): 37–48.Some of the models just presented allow options on zero-coupon bonds to be valued analytically. For the Vasicek, Ho–Lee, and Hull–White one-factor models, the price at time zero of a call option that matures at time T  on a zero-coupon bond maturing at 
time s is
 
LP10, s2N1h2-KP10, T2N1h-sP2 (32.10)

Technical Note 31 shows that, in the case of the Vasicek and Hull–White models,
sP=s
a31-e-a1s-T24B1-e-2aT
2a
and, in the case of the Ho–Lee model,
sP=s1s-T22T
Equation (32.10) is essentially the same as Black’s model for pricing bond options in 
Section 29.1 with the forward bond price volatility equaling sP>1T. As explained in 
Section 29.2, an interest rate cap or floor can be expressed as a portfolio of options on 
zero-coupon bonds. It can, therefore, be valued analytically using the equations just presented.
There are also formulas for valuing options on zero-coupon bonds in the Cox,  
Ingersoll, and Ross model, which we presented in Section 31. 2. These involve integrals 
of the noncentral chi-square distribution.
Options on Coupon-Bearing Bonds
In a one-factor model of r, all zero-coupon bonds move up in price when r decreases  
and all zero-coupon bonds move down in price when r increases. As a result, a one- 
factor model allows a European option on a coupon-bearing bond to be expressed as the sum of European options on zero-coupon bonds. The procedure is as follows:
1. Calculate r
*, the critical value of r for which the price of the coupon-bearing bond 
equals the strike price of the option on the bond at the option maturity T.
2. Calculate prices of European options with maturity T on the zero-coupon bonds 
that comprise the coupon-bearing bond. The strike prices of the options equal the values the zero-coupon bonds will have at time T when r = r
*.
3. Set the price of the European option on the coupon-bearing bond equal to the  
sum of the prices on the options on zero-coupon bonds calculated in Step 2.
This allows options on coupon-bearing bonds to be valued for the Vasicek, Cox,  
Ingersoll, and Ross, Ho–Lee, and Hull–White models. As explained in Business Snap-
shot 29.2, a European swap option can be viewed as an option on a coupon-bearing bond. It can, therefore, be valued using this procedure. For more details on the procedure and a numerical example, see Technical Note 15 at www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull/TechnicalNotes.
The models we have looked at give rise to different volatility environments. Figure 32.3 shows patterns for the volatility of the 3-month forward rate as a function of maturity for  
the Ho–Lee, Hull–White one-factor, and Hull–White two-factor models. The term structure of interest rates is assumed to be flat.
For Ho–Lee the volatility of the 3-month forward rate is the same for all maturities.  
In the one-factor Hull–White model the effect of mean reversion is to cause the  32.3 VOLATILITY STRUCTURES
M32_HULL0654_11_GE_C32.indd   737 30/04/2021   17:50738 CHAPTER 32
volatility of the 3-month forward rate to be a declining function of maturity. In the 
Hull–White two-factor model when parameters are chosen appropriately, the volatility  
of the 3-month forward rate has a “humped” look. The latter is consistent with  
empirical evidence and implied cap volatilities discussed in Section 29.2.Figure 32.3 Volatility of 3-month forward rate as a function of maturity for (a) the 
Ho–Lee model, (b) the Hull–White one-factor model, and (c) the Hull–White two-factor model (when parameters are chosen appropriately).

An interest rate tree is a discrete-time representation of the stochastic process for the short rate in much the same way as a stock price tree is a discrete-time representation of the process followed by a stock price. If the time step on the tree is 
∆t, the rates on the 
tree are the continuously compounded ∆t-period rates. The usual assumption when a 
tree is constructed is that the ∆t-period rate, R, follows the same stochastic process as  
the instantaneous rate, r, in the corresponding continuous-time model. The main  
difference between interest rate trees and stock price trees is in the way that discounting  
is done. In a stock price tree, the discount rate is usually assumed to be the same at  
each node or a function of time. In an interest rate tree, the discount rate depends on r and varies from node to node.
It often proves to be convenient to use a trinomial rather than a binomial tree for 
interest rates. The main advantage of a trinomial tree is that it provides an extra degree of freedom, making it easier for the tree to represent features of the interest rate process  
such as mean reversion. As mentioned in Section 21. 8, using a trinomial tree is  
equivalent to using the explicit finite difference method.
Illustration of Use of Trinomial Trees
To illustrate how trinomial interest rate trees are used to value derivatives, consider the simple example shown in Figure 32.4. This is a two-step tree with each time step equal  
to 1 year in length so that 
∆t=1 year. Assume that the up, middle, and down  
probabilities are 0.25, 0.50, and 0.25, respectively, at each node. The assumed ∆t-period 
rate is shown as the upper number at each node.632.4 INTEREST RATE TREES
6 We explain later how the probabilities and rates on an interest rate tree are determined.
M32_HULL0654_11_GE_C32.indd   738 30/04/2021   17:50No-Arbitrage Models of the Short Rate 739
The tree is used to value a derivative that provides a payoff at the end of the second 
time step of
max31001R-0.11), 04
where R is the ∆t-period rate. The calculated value of this derivative is the lower  
number at each node. At the final nodes, the value of the derivative equals the payoff. 
For example, at node E, the value is 100*10.14-0.112=3. At earlier nodes, the value 
of the derivative is calculated using the rollback procedure explained in Chapters 13 and 21. At node B, the 1 -year interest rate is 12%. This is used for discounting to obtain the value of the derivative at node B from its values at nodes E, F, and G as
30.25*3+0.5*1+0.25*04e-0.12*1=1.11
At node C, the 1 -year interest rate is 10%. This is used for discounting to obtain the  
value of the derivative at node C as
10.25*1+0.5*0+0.25*02e-0.1*1=0.23
At the initial node, A, the interest rate is also 10% and the value of the derivative is
10.25*1.11+0.5*0.23+0.25*02e-0.1*1=0.35
Nonstandard Branching
It sometimes proves convenient to modify the standard trinomial branching pattern that is used at all nodes in Figure 32.4. Three alternative branching possibilities are shown in Figure 32.5. The usual branching is shown in Figure 32.5a. It is “up one/straight along/ 
down one”. One alternative to this is “up two/up one/straight along”, as shown in  Figure 32.4 Example of the use of trinomial interest rate trees. Upper number at each  
node is rate; lower number is value of instrument.

very low. A third branching pattern shown in Figure 32.5c is “straight along/down one/ 
down two”. This is useful for incorporating mean reversion when interest rates are very high. The use of different branching patterns is illustrated in the following section.Figure 32.5 Alternative branching methods in a trinomial tree.

Hull and White have proposed a robust two-stage procedure for constructing trinomial trees to represent a wide range of one-factor models.
7 This section first explains how the 
procedure can be used for the Hull–White model in equation (32.4) and then shows how it can be extended to represent other models, such as Black–Karasinski.
First Stage
The Hull–White model for the instantaneous short rate r is
dr=3u1t2-ar4 dt+s dz
We suppose that the time step on the tree is constant and equal to ∆t.8
Assume that the ∆t rate, R, follows the same process as r.
dR=3u1t2-aR4 dt+s dz
Clearly, this is reasonable in the limit as ∆t tends to zero. The first stage in building a  
tree for this model is to construct a tree for a variable R* that is initially zero and  
follows the process
dR*=-aR* dt+s dz
This process is symmetrical about R*=0. The variable R*1t+∆t2-R*1t2 is normally 
distributed. If terms of higher order than ∆t are ignored, the expected value of 
R*1t+∆t2-R*1t2 is -aR*1t2∆t and the variance of R*1t+∆t2-R*1t2 is s2 ∆t.32.5 A GENERAL TREE-BUILDING PROCEDURE

The spacing between interest rates on the tree, ∆R, is set as
∆R=s13∆t
This proves to be a good choice of ∆R from the viewpoint of error minimization.
The objective of the first stage of the procedure is to build a tree similar to that shown  
in Figure 32.6 for R*. To do this, it is first necessary to resolve which of the three  
branching methods shown in Figure 32.5 will apply at each node. This will determine 
the overall geometry of the tree. Once this is done, the branching probabilities must also be calculated.
Define (i, j) as the node where 
t=i∆t and R*=j∆R. (The variable i is a positive 
integer and j is a positive or negative integer.) The branching method used at a node must lead to the probabilities on all three branches being positive. Most of the time, the branching shown in Figure 32.5a is appropriate. When 
a70, it is necessary to switch 
from the branching in Figure 32.5a to the branching in Figure 32.5c for a sufficiently large j. Similarly, it is necessary to switch from the branching in Figure 32.5a to the 
branching in Figure 32.5b when j is sufficiently negative. Define 
jmax as the value of j 
where we switch from the Figure 32.5a branching to the Figure 32.5c branching and jmin 
as the value of j where we switch from the Figure 32.5a branching to the Figure 32.5b 
branching. Hull and White show that probabilities are always positive if jmax is set equal 
to the smallest integer greater than 0.184>1a ∆t2 and jmin is set equal to -jmax.9 Define 
9 The probabilities are positive for any value of jmax between 0.184>1a ∆t2 and 0.816>1a ∆t2 and for any value 
of jmin between -0.184>1a ∆t2 and -0.816>1a ∆t2. Changing the branching at the first possible node proves to 
be computationally most efficient.
M32_HULL0654_11_GE_C32.indd   741 30/04/2021   17:50742 CHAPTER 32
pu, pm, and pd as the probabilities of the highest, middle, and lowest branches emanating 
from the node. The probabilities are chosen to match the expected change and variance 
of the change in R* over the next time interval ∆t. The probabilities must also sum to 
unity. This leads to three equations in the three probabilities.
As already mentioned, the mean change in R* in time ∆t is -aR*∆t and the variance 
of the change is s2∆t. At node 1i, j2, R*=j∆R. If the branching has the form shown  
in Figure 32.5a, the pu, pm, and pd at node (i, j) must satisfy the following three  
equations to match the mean and standard deviation:
pu∆R-pd∆R=-aj∆R∆t
pu∆R2+pd∆R2=s2∆t+a2j2∆R2∆t2
pu+pm+pd=1
Using ∆R=s23∆t, the solution to these equations is

To illustrate the first stage of the tree construction, suppose that s=0.01, a=0.1,  
and ∆t=1 year. In this case, ∆R=0.0113=0.0173, jmax is set equal to the smallest 
integer greater than 0.184> 0.1, and jmin=-jmax. This means that jmax=2 and  
jmin=-2 and the tree is as shown in Figure 32.6. The probabilities on the branches  
emanating from each node are shown below the tree and are calculated using the  
equations above for pu, pm, and pd.
Note that the probabilities at each node in Figure 32.6 depend only on j. For  
example, the probabilities at node B are the same as the probabilities at node F.  
Furthermore, the tree is symmetrical. The probabilities at node D are the mirror image 
of the probabilities at node B.
Second Stage
The second stage in the tree construction is to convert the tree for R* into a tree for R .  
This is accomplished by displacing the nodes on the R*-tree so that the initial term 
M32_HULL0654_11_GE_C32.indd   742 30/04/2021   17:50No-Arbitrage Models of the Short Rate 743
structure of interest rates is exactly matched. Define
a1t2=R1t2-R*1t2
The a1t2’s that apply as the time step ∆t on the tree becomes infinitesimally small can be 
calculated analytically from equation (32.5).10 However, we want a tree with a finite ∆t to 
match the term structure exactly, so we use an iterative procedure to determine the a’s.
Define ai as a1i ∆t2, the value of R at time i ∆t on the R-tree minus the corresponding 
value of R* at time i ∆t on the R*-tree. Define Qi, j as the present value of a security that 
pays off $1 if node (i, j) is reached and zero otherwise. The ai and Qi,j can be calculated 
using forward induction in such a way that the initial term structure is matched exactly.
Illustration of Second Stage
Suppose that the continuously compounded zero rates in the example in Figure 32.6 are 
as shown in Table 32.1. The value of Q0,0 is 1.0. The value of a0 is chosen to give the  
right price for a zero-coupon bond maturing at time ∆t. That is, a0 is set equal to the  
initial ∆t-period interest rate. Because ∆t=1 in this example, a0=0.03824. This 
defines the position of the initial node on the R-tree in Figure 32.7. The next step is  
to calculate the values of Q1,1, Q1,0, and Q1,-1. There is a probability of 0.1667 that the 
(1, 1) node is reached and the discount rate for the first time step is 3.82%. The value of 
Q1,1 is therefore 0.1667e-0.03824=0.1604. Similarly, Q1,0=0.6417 and Q1, -1=0.1604.
10 To estimate the instantaneous a1t2 analytically, we note that
dR=3u1t2-aR4 dt+s dz and dR*=-aR*dt+s dz
so that da=3u1t2-aa1t24 dt. Using equation (32.7), it can be seen that the solution to this is

and ∆t=1, the price of this bond as seen at node B is e-1a1+0.017322. Similarly, the price as  
seen at node C is e-a1 and the price as seen at node D is e-1a1-0.017322. The price as seen at 
the initial node A is therefore
 Q1,1e-1a1+0.017322+Q1,0e-a1+Q1,-1e-1a1-0.017322 (32.11)
From the initial term structure, this bond price should be e-0.04512*2=0.9137.

The next step is to calculate Q2,2, Q2,1, Q2,0, Q2,-1, and Q2,-2. The calculations can 
be shortened by using previously determined Q values. Consider Q2,1 as an example. 
This is the value of a security that pays off $1 if node F is reached and zero otherwise. 
Node F can be reached only from nodes B and C. The interest rates at these nodes are 6.937% and 5.205%, respectively. The probabilities associated with the B–F and C–F  
branches are 0.6566 and 0.1667. The value at node B of a security that pays $1 at  
node F is therefore 
0.6566e-0.06937. The value at node C is 0.1667e-0.05205. The variable 
Q2,1 is 0.6566e-0.06937 times the present value of $1 received at node B plus  
0.1667e-0.05205 times the present value of $1 received at node C; that is,
Q2,1=0.6566e-0.06937*0.1604+0.1667e-0.05205*0.6417=0.1998
Similarly, Q2,2=0.0182, Q2,0=0.4736, Q2,-1=0.2033, and Q2,-2=0.0189.

The next step in producing the R-tree in Figure 32.7 is to calculate a2. After that, the 
Q3,j’s can then be computed. The variable a3 can then be calculated, and so on.
Formulas for A’s and Q ’s
To express the approach more formally, suppose that the Qi, j have been determined for 
i…m1mÚ02. The next step is to determine am so that the tree correctly prices a zero- 
coupon bond maturing at 1m+12∆t. The interest rate at node (m, j) is am+j∆R, so 
that the price of a zero-coupon bond maturing at time 1m+12∆t is given by
 Pm+1=anm
j=-nmQm, j exp3-1am+j∆R2∆t4 (32.12)
where nm is the number of nodes on each side of the central node at time m ∆t. The 
solution to this equation is
am=lnanm
j=-nmQm, je-j∆R∆t-ln Pm+1
∆t
Once am has been determined, the Qi, j for i=m+1 can be calculated using
Qm+1, j=a
kQm,kq1k, j2 exp3-1am+k ∆R2 ∆t4
where q(k, j) is the probability of moving from node (m, k) to node 1m+1, j2 and the 
summation is taken over all values of k for which this is nonzero.
Extension to Other Models
The procedure that has just been outlined can be extended to more general models of 
the form
 d f1r 2=3u1t2-a f1r24 dt+s dz (32.13)
where f is a monotonic function of r. This family of models has the property that they 
can fit any term structure.11
As before, we assume that the ∆t period rate, R, follows the same process as r:
d f1R 2=3u1t2-af1R 24 dt+s dz
We start by setting x=f1R 2, so that
dx=3u1t2-ax4 dt+s dz
The first stage is to build a tree for a variable x* that follows the same process as x 
except that u1t2=0 and the initial value is zero. The procedure here is identical to the 
procedure already outlined for building a tree such as that in Figure 32.6.
11 Not all no-arbitrage models have this property. For example, the extended-CIR model, considered by Cox, 
Ingersoll, and Ross (1985) and Hull and White (1990), which has the form
dr=3u1t2-ar4 dt+s1r dz
cannot fit yield curves where the forward rate declines sharply. This is because the process is not well defined 
when u1t2 is negative.
M32_HULL0654_11_GE_C32.indd   745 30/04/2021   17:50746 CHAPTER 32
As in Figure 3 2.7, the nodes at time i ∆t are then displaced by an amount ai to provide 
an exact fit to the initial term structure. The equations for determining ai and Qi, j  
inductively are slightly different from those for the f1R 2=R case. The value of Q  at the  
first node, Q0,0, is set equal to 1. Suppose that the Qi, j have been determined for i…m
1mÚ02. The next step is to determine am so that the tree correctly prices an 1m+12∆t 
zero-coupon bond. Define g as the inverse function of f so that the ∆t-period interest 
rate at the jth node at time m ∆t is
g1am+j ∆x2
The price of a zero-coupon bond maturing at time 1m+12∆t is given by
 Pm+1=anm
j=-nmQm, j exp3-g1am+j ∆x2∆t4 (32.14)
This equation can be solved using a numerical procedure such as Newton–Raphson. 
The value a0 of a when m=0, is f1R 1022.
Once am has been determined, the Qi, j for i=m+1 can be calculated using
Qm+1, j=a
kQm,kq1k, j2 exp3-g1am+k ∆x2∆t4
where q(k, j) is the probability of moving from node (m, k) to node 1m+1, j2 and the 
summation is taken over all values of k where this is nonzero.

Figure 32.8 shows the results of applying the procedure to the Black–Karasinski model 
in equation (32.9):
d ln1r2=3u1t2-a ln1r24 dt+s dz
when a=0.22, s=0.25, ∆t=0.5, and the zero rates are as in Table 32.1.
Setting f(r) = r leads to the Hull–White model in equation (32.4); setting f(r) = ln(r)  
leads to the Black–Karasinski model in equation (32.9). The main advantage of the 
f1r2=r model is its analytic tractability.
Negative Rates
Traditionally the main disadvantage of Hull-White has been that it allows interest rates 
to become negative. Some analysts have been reluctant to use a model where there is  
any chance at all of negative rates and have therefore preferred f1r2=ln1r2 even though 
it has no analytic tractability.
This aversion to models that give rise to negative rates has changed somewhat in 
recent years because, as mentioned in earlier chapters, negative interest rates have become a feature of financial markets in some countries. The Ho–Lee and Hull–White models are similar in spirit to the Bachelier normal model discussed in Section 29.2.
12 
They can be used to value nonstandard deals in negative interest rate environments. An alternative is to use a “shifted Black–Karasinski” model. In this, 
r+a rather than r is 
assumed to follow the process in equation (32.9), so that
d ln1r+a2=3u1t2-a ln1r+a24 dt+s dz
The short-term interest rate can then become (almost) as low as -a.
Multiple Yield Curves
The yield curve used for discounting is the risk-free zero curve obtained from the  
overnight indexed swaps (OIS) market. Up to now, we have implicitly assumed that this is also the yield curve determining payoffs on the derivative so that derivatives can be valued by modeling this one yield curve. When the payoffs depend on another yield curve (e.g., the Treasury curve or a curve corresponding to risky borrowing), an analyst has to construct a model incorporating movements in both curves. One approach is to use the methods discussed in this chapter to model the risk-free (OIS) short rate and set  
the spreads between the two rates at future times equal to the spreads between the  
forward rates calculated from the two yield curves today. A more sophisticated  
approach is to use a three-dimensional tree where two short rates are modeled.
13
Using Analytic Results in Conjunction with Trees
When a tree is constructed for the f1r2=r version of the Hull–White model, the  
analytic results in Section 32.1 can be used to provide the complete term structure  
12 There is a slight difference. Suppose that the tenor of the rate being considered is t. In the Bachelier normal 
model, the rate is assumed to be normal when the compounding frequency used to measure the interest rate  
is t. In Ho–Lee and Hull–White, the interest rate is also normal, but with continuous compounding.

and European option prices at each node. It is important to recognize that the interest 
rate on the tree is the ∆t-period rate R. It is not the instantaneous short rate r.
From equations (32.6), (32.7), and (32.8), it can be shown (see Problem 32.15) that
 P1t, T2=An1t, T2e-nB1t, T2R (32.15)
where

(In the case of the Ho–Lee model, we set Bn1t, T2=T-t in these equations.)
Bond prices should therefore be calculated with equation (32.15), and not with  
equation (32.6).
Example 32.1
Suppose zero rates are as in Table 32.2. The rates for maturities between those 
indicated are generated using linear interpolation.
Consider a 3-year 1= 3*365 days2 European put option on a zero-coupon 
bond that will pay 100 in 9 years 1= 9*365 days2. Interest rates are assumed 
to follow the Hull–White 1f1r 2=r2 model. The strike price is 63, a=0.1, and 
s=0.01. A 3-year tree is constructed and zero-coupon bond prices are calculated 
analytically at the final nodes as just described. As shown in Table 32.3, the results from the tree are consistent with the analytic price of the option.

This example provides a good test of the implementation of the model because 
the gradient of the zero curve changes sharply immediately after the expiration of 
the option. Small errors in the construction and use of the tree are liable to have a  
big effect on the option values obtained. (See also Sample Application G of the DerivaGem Applications software.)
Tree for American Bond Options
The DerivaGem software accompanying this book implements the normal and  
the lognormal model for valuing European and American bond options, caps/floors,  
and European swap options. Figure 32.9 shows the tree produced by the software when it is used to value a 1.5-year American call option on a 10-year bond using four time steps and the lognormal (Black–Karasinski) model. The parameters used in the  
lognormal model are 
a=5% and s=20%. The underlying bond lasts 10 years, has  
a principal of 100, and pays a coupon of 5% per annum semiannually. The yield curve is flat at 5% per annum. The strike price is 105. As explained in Section 29.1 the strike price can be a cash strike price or a quoted strike price. In this case it is a quoted strike price. The bond price shown on the tree is the cash bond price. The accrued interest at  
each node is shown below the tree. The cash strike price is calculated as the quoted strike price plus accrued interest. The quoted bond price is the cash bond price minus accrued interest. The payoff from the option is the cash bond price minus the cash strike price. Equivalently it is the quoted bond price minus the quoted strike price.
The tree gives the price of the option as 0.672. A much larger tree with 100 time steps 
gives the price of the option as 0.703. Note that the price of the 10-year bond cannot be computed analytically when the lognormal model is assumed. It is computed numerically by rolling back through a much larger tree than that shown.Steps Tree Analytic

Up to now, we have assumed that the volatility parameters a and s are known. We now 
discuss how they are determined. This is known as calibrating the model.
The volatility parameters are determined from market data on actively traded 
options. These will be referred to as the calibrating instruments. The first stage is to choose a “goodness-of-fit” measure. Suppose there are n calibrating instruments. A 
popular goodness-of-fit measure is 
an
i=11Ui-Vi22, where Ui is the market price of the 32.6 CALIBRATION
M32_HULL0654_11_GE_C32.indd   749 30/04/2021   17:51750 CHAPTER 32
ith calibrating instrument and Vi is the price given by the model for this instrument. The 
objective of calibration is to choose the model parameters so that this goodness-of-fit 
measure is minimized.
The number of volatility parameters should not be greater than the number of  
calibrating instruments. If a and s are constant, there are only two volatility parameters.  
The models can be extended so that a or s, or both, are functions of time. Step functions  
can be used. Suppose, for example, that a is constant and s is a function of time. We 
might choose times t1, t2,c, tn and assume s1t2=s0 for t…t1, s1t2=si for 
ti6t…ti+1 11…i…n-12, and s1t2=sn for t7tn. There would then be a total of 
n+2 volatility parameters: a, s0, s1,c, and sn.
The minimization of the goodness-of-fit measure can be accomplished using the  
Levenberg–Marquardt procedure.14 When a or s, or both, are functions of time, a  Figure 32.9 Tree, produced by DerivaGem, for valuing an American bond option.

penalty function is often added to the goodness-of-fit measure so that the functions are 
“well behaved” . In the example just mentioned, where s is a step function, an appropriate 
objective function is
an
i=11Ui-Vi22+an
i=1w1,i1si-si-122+an-1
i=1w2,i1si-1+si+1-2si22
The second term provides a penalty for large changes in s between one step and the 
next. The third term provides a penalty for high curvature in s. Appropriate values for 
w1,i and w2,i are based on experimentation and are chosen to provide a reasonable level 
of smoothness in the s function.
The calibrating instruments chosen should be as similar as possible to the instrument 
being valued. Suppose, for example, that the model is to be used to value a Bermudan-  
style swap option that lasts 10 years and can be exercised on any payment date between year 5 and year 9 into a swap maturing 10 years from today. The most relevant  
calibrating instruments are 5 *  5, 6 *  4, 7 *  3, 8 *  2, and 9 *  1 European swap options.  
(An 
n*m European swap option is an n-year option to enter into a swap lasting for 
m years beyond the maturity of the option.)
The advantage of making a or s, or both, functions of time is that the models can be 
fitted more precisely to the prices of instruments that trade actively in the market. The disadvantage is that the volatility structure becomes nonstationary. The volatility term structure given by the model in the future is liable to be quite different from that existing in the market today.
15
A somewhat different approach to calibration is to use all available calibrating 
instruments to calculate “global-best-fit” a and s parameters. The parameter a is held  
fixed at its best-fit value. The model can then be used in the same way as Black– Scholes–Merton. There is a one-to-one relationship between options prices and the 
s  
parameter. The model can be used to calculate implied s’s.16 These can be used to  
assess the s most appropriate for pricing the instrument under consideration.
15 For a discussion of the implementation of a model where a and s are functions of time, see Technical  
Note 16 at www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull/TechnicalNotes.
16 Note that in a term structure model the implied s’s are not the same as the implied volatilities calculated 
from Black’s model. The procedure for computing implied s’s is as follows. The Black volatilities are  
converted to prices using Black’s model. An iterative procedure is then used to imply the s parameter in the 
term structure model from the price.Section 29.4 outlined some general approaches to hedging a portfolio of interest rate  
derivatives. These approaches can be used with the term structure models in this  
chapter. The calculation of deltas, gammas, and vegas involves making small changes to either the zero curve or the volatility environment and recomputing the value of the portfolio.
Note that, although one factor is often assumed when pricing interest rate derivatives,  
it is not appropriate to assume only one factor when hedging. For example, the deltas calculated should allow for many different movements in the yield curve, not just those that are possible under the model chosen. The practice of taking account of changes that  32.7 HEDGING USING A ONE-FACTOR MODEL
M32_HULL0654_11_GE_C32.indd   751 30/04/2021   17:51752 CHAPTER 32
cannot happen under the model considered, as well as those that can, is known as  
outside model hedging and is standard practice for traders.17 The reality is that relatively 
simple one-factor models if used carefully usually give reasonable prices for instruments, 
but good hedging procedures must explicitly or implicitly assume many factors.
SUMMARY
When valuing derivatives, it is important that the model used be consistent with the initial term structure observed in the market. No-arbitrage models are designed to have this property. They take the initial term structure as given and define how it can evolve.
This chapter has provided a description of a number of one-factor no-arbitrage  
models of the short rate. These are robust and can be used in conjunction with any set of initial zero rates. The simplest model is the Ho–Lee model. This has the advantage that it is analytically tractable. Its chief disadvantage is that it implies that all rates are equally variable at all times. The Hull–White model is a version of the Ho–Lee model that includes mean reversion. It allows a richer description of the volatility environment  
while preserving its analytic tractability. Lognormal one-factor models avoid the  
possibility of negative interest rates, but have no analytic tractability.

a=0.05, b=0.08, and s=0.015 in Vasicek’s model with the initial short-
term interest rate being 6%. Calculate the price of a 2.1 -year European call option on a bond that will mature in 3 years. Suppose that the bond pays a coupon of 5%  
semiannually. The principal of the bond is 100 and the strike price of the option is 99. The strike price is the cash price (not the quoted price) that will be paid for the bond.
 32.6.  Use the answer to Problem 32.5 and put–call parity arguments to calculate the price of a  
put option that has the same terms as the call option in Problem 32.5.
 32.7. In the Hull–White model, 
a=0.08 and s=0.01. Calculate the price of a 1 -year  
European call option on a zero-coupon bond that will mature in 5 years when the term structure is flat at 10%, the principal of the bond is $100, and the strike price is $68.
 32.8.  Suppose that 
a=0.05 and s=0.015 in the Hull–White model with the initial term 
structure being flat at 6% with semiannual compounding. Calculate the price of a  
2.1 -year European call option on a bond that will mature in 3 years. Suppose that the bond pays a coupon of 5% per annum semiannually. The principal of the bond is 100 and the strike price of the option is 99. The strike price is the cash price (not the quoted price) that will be paid for the bond.
 32.9.  Suppose 
a=0.05, s=0.015, and the term structure is flat at 10%. Construct a  
trinomial tree for the Hull–White model where there are two time steps, each 1 year in length.
 32.10.  Calculate the price of a 2-year zero-coupon bond from the tree in Figure 32.4.
 32.11.  Calculate the price of a 2-year zero-coupon bond from the tree in Figure 32.7 and verify

 32.12.  Calculate the price of an 18-month zero-coupon bond from the tree in Figure 32.8 and 
verify that it agrees with the initial term structure.
 32.13.  What does the calibration of a one-factor term structure model involve?
 32.14.  Prove equations (32.15), (32.16), and (32.17).
 32.15.  A trader wishes to compute the price of a 1 -year American call option on a 5-year bond 
with a face value of 100. The bond pays a coupon of 6% semiannually and the (quoted)  
strike price of the option is $100. The continuously compounded zero rates for  
maturities of 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, and 5 years are 4.5%, 5%,  
5.5%, 5.8%, 6.1%, and 6.3%. The best-fit reversion rate for either the normal or the  
lognormal model has been estimated as 5%.
   A 1 -year European call option with a (quoted) strike price of 100 on the bond is actively  
traded. Its market price is $0.50. The trader decides to use this option for calibration. Use the DerivaGem software with 10 time steps to answer the following questions:
(a) Assuming a normal model, imply the 
s parameter from the price of the European 
option.
(b) Use the s parameter to calculate the price of the option when it is American.
M32_HULL0654_11_GE_C32.indd   753 30/04/2021   17:51754 CHAPTER 32
(c) Repeat (a) and (b) for the lognormal model. Show that the model used does not  
significantly affect the price obtained providing it is calibrated to the known European  
price.
(d) Display the tree for the normal model and calculate the probability of a negative 
interest rate occurring.
(e) Display the tree for the lognormal model and verify that the option price is correctly calculated at the node where, with the notation of Section 32.4, 
i=9 and j=-1.
 32.16.  Verify that the DerivaGem software gives Figure 32.9 for the example considered. Use 
the software to calculate the price of the American bond option for the lognormal and normal models when the strike price is 95, 100, and 105. In the case of the normal model,  
assume that a = 5% and s = 1%. Discuss the results in the context of the heavy-tails  
arguments of Chapter 20.
 32.17. Modify Sample Application G in the DerivaGem Application Builder software to test 
the convergence of the price of the trinomial tree when it is used to price a 2-year call option on a 5-year bond with a face value of 100. Suppose that the strike price (quoted) is 100, the coupon rate is 7% with coupons being paid twice a year. Assume that the zero curve is as in Table 32.2. Compare results for the following cases:
(a) Option is European; normal model with 
s=0.01 and a=0.05
(b) Option is European; lognormal model with s = 0.15 and a=0.05
(c) Option is American; normal model with s=0.01 and a=0.05
(d) Option is American; lognormal model with s=0.15 and a=0.05.

Modeling 
Forward Rates
The interest rate models discussed in Chapter 32 are widely used for pricing instruments 
when the simpler models in Chapter 29 are inappropriate. They are easy to implement and, if used carefully, can ensure that most nonstandard interest rate derivatives are priced consistently with actively traded instruments such as interest rate caps, European swap options, and European bond options. Two limitations of the models are:
1. Most involve only one factor (i.e., one source of uncertainty).
2. They do not give the user complete freedom in choosing the volatility structure.
By making the parameters a  and 
s functions of time, an analyst can use the models so 
that they fit the volatilities observed in the market today, but as mentioned in Section 32.6 the volatility term structure is then nonstationary. The volatility structure in the future is liable to be quite different from that observed in the market today.
This chapter discusses some general approaches to building term structure models 
that give the user more flexibility in specifying the volatility environment and allow several factors to be used.
This chapter also covers the agency mortgage-backed security market in the United 
States and describes how some of the ideas presented in the chapter can be used to price instruments in that market.33 CHAPTER  
33.1 THE HEATH, JARROW, AND MORTON MODEL
In 1990 David Heath, Bob Jarrow, and Andy Morton (HJM) published an important paper describing the no-arbitrage conditions that must be satisfied by a model of the yield curve.
1 To describe their model, we will use the following notation:
P1t, T2:  Price at time t of a risk-free zero-coupon bond with principal $1  maturing at time T
Ωt:  Vector of past and present values of interest rates and bond prices at 
time t that are relevant for determining bond price volatilities at that time
1 See D. Heath, R. A. Jarrow, and A. Morton, “Bond Pricing and the Term Structure of Interest Rates:  
A New Methodology,” Econometrica, 60, 1 (1992): 77–105.
M33_HULL0654_11_GE_C33.indd   755 30/04/2021   17:51756 CHAPTER 33
v1t, T, Ωt2: Volatility of P1t, T2
f1t, T1, T22:  Forward rate as seen at time t  for the period between time T1 and  
time T2
F1t, T2:  Instantaneous forward rate as seen at time t  for a contract maturing at 
time T
r1t2: Short-term risk-free interest rate at time t
dz1t2: Wiener process driving term structure movements.
Processes for Zero-Coupon Bond Prices and Forward Rates
We start by assuming there is just one factor and will use the traditional risk-neutral 
world. A zero-coupon bond is a traded security providing no income. Its return in the traditional risk-neutral world must therefore be r. This means that its stochastic process has the form
 
dP1t, T2=r1t2P1t, T2 dt+v1t, T, Ωt2 P1t, T2 dz1t2 (33.1)
As the argument Ωt indicates, the zero-coupon bond’s volatility v can be, in the most 
general form of the model, any well-behaved function of past and present interest rates 
and bond prices. Because a bond’s price volatility declines to zero at maturity, we must have
2
v1t, t, Ωt2=0
From equation (4.5), the forward rate f1t, T1, T22 can be related to zero-coupon bond 
prices as follows:
 f1t, T1, T22=ln3P1t, T124-ln3P1t, T224
T2-T1 (33.2)
From equation (33.1) and Itô’s lemma,
d ln3P1t, T124=cr1t2-v1t, T1, Ωt22
2ddt+v1t, T1, Ωt2 dz1t2
and
d ln3P1t, T224=cr1t2-v1t, T2, Ωt22
2ddt+v1t, T2, Ωt2 dz1t2
so that from equation (33.2)
d f1t, T1, T22=v1t, T2, Ωt22-v1t, T1, Ωt22
21T2-T12 dt+v1t, T1, Ωt2-v1t, T2, Ωt2
T2-T1 dz1t2 (33.3)
Equation (33.3) shows that the risk-neutral process for f depends solely on the v’s. It 
depends on r and the P’s only to the extent that the v’s themselves depend on these variables.
When we put 
T1=T and T2=T+∆T in equation (33.3) and then take limits as ∆T 
tends to zero, f1t, T1, T22 becomes F1t, T2, the coefficient of dz1t2 becomes -vT1t, T, Ωt2,  
2 The v1t, t, Ωt2=0 condition is equivalent to the assumption that all zero-coupon bonds have finite drifts at 
all times. If the volatility of the bond does not decline to zero at maturity, an infinite drift may be necessary to  
ensure that the bond’s price equals its face value at maturity.
M33_HULL0654_11_GE_C33.indd   756 30/04/2021   17:51Modeling Forward Rates 757
and the coefficient of dt becomes
1
20  3v1t, T, Ωt224
0  T=v1t, T, Ωt2vT1t, T, Ωt2
where the subscript to v denotes a partial derivative. It follows that
 dF1t, T2=v1t, T, Ωt2vT1t, T, Ωt2dt-vT1t, T, Ωt2 dz1t2 (33.4)
Once the function v1t, T, Ωt2 has been specified, the risk-neutral processes for the  
F(t, T)’s are known.
Equation (33.4) shows that there is a link between the drift and standard deviation of  
an instantaneous forward rate. This is the key HJM result. Integrating vt1t, t, Ωt2 
between t=t and t=T leads to
v1t, T, Ωt2-v1t, t, Ωt2=3T
tvt1t, t, Ωt2 dt
Because v1t, t, Ωt2=0, this becomes
v1t, T, Ωt2=3T
tvt1t, t, Ωt2dt
If m1t, T, Ωt2 and s1t, T, Ωt2 are the instantaneous drift and standard deviation of 
F1t, T2, so that
dF1t, T2=m1t, T, Ωt2 dt+s1t, T, Ωt2 dz
then it follows from equation (33.4) that
 m1t, T, Ωt2=s1t, T, Ωt23T
ts1t, t, Ωt2 dt (33.5)
This is the HJM result.
The process for the short rate r  in the general HJM model is non-Markov. This 
means that the process for r  at a future time t  depends on the path followed by r 
between now and time t  as well as on the the value of r  at time t .3 This is the key 
problem in implementing a general HJM model. Monte Carlo simulation has to be 
used. It is difficult to use a tree to represent term structure movements because the tree is usually nonrecombining. Assuming the model has one factor and the tree is binomial  
as in Figure 33.1, there are 
2n nodes after n  time steps (when n=30, 2n is about  
1 billion).
The HJM model in equation (33.4) is deceptively complex. A particular forward rate  
F1t, T2 is Markov in most applications of the model and can be represented by a 
recombining tree. However, the same tree cannot be used for all forward rates. Setting 
s1t, T, Ωt2 equal to a constant, s, leads to the Ho–Lee model (see Problem 33.3); setting  
s1t, T, Ωt2=se-a1T-t2 leads to the Hull–White model (see Problem 33.4). These are 
particular Markov cases of HJM where the same recombining tree can be used to  
represent the short rate, r, and all forward rates.

Extension to Several Factors
The HJM result can be extended to the situation where there are several independent 
factors. Suppose
dF1t, T2=m1t, T, Ωt2dt +a
ksk1t, T, Ωt2 dzk
A similar analysis to that just given (see Problem 33.2) shows that
 m1t, T, Ωt2=a

tsk1t, t, Ωt2dt (33.6)Figure 33.1 A nonrecombining tree such as that arising from the general HJM model.
4 See A. Brace, D. Gatarek, and M. Musiela “The Market Model of Interest Rate Dynamics,” Mathematical 
Finance 7, 2 (1997): 127–55; F. Jamshidian, “LIBOR and Swap Market Models and Measures,” Finance and  
Stochastics, 1 (1997): 293–330; and K. Miltersen, K. Sandmann, and D. Sondermann, “Closed Form  
Solutions for Term Structure Derivatives with LogNormal Interest Rate,” Journal of Finance, 52, 1 (March 
1997): 409–30.33.2 THE BGM MODEL
One drawback of the HJM model is that it is expressed in terms of instantaneous 
 forward rates and these are not directly observable in the market. Another related 
drawback is that it is difficult to calibrate the model to prices of actively traded  
instruments. This has led Brace, Gatarek, and Musiela (BGM), Jamshidian, and  Miltersen, Sandmann, and Sondermann to propose an alternative.
4 At the time the 
model was developed, LIBOR was commonly used for both discounting and defining 
payoffs. For this reason it was termed the LIBOR market model. However, the same  
approach can be used to model risk-free rates determined from overnight indexed swaps.
M33_HULL0654_11_GE_C33.indd   758 30/04/2021   17:51Modeling Forward Rates 759
The Model
Define t0=0 and let t1, t2,c be the reset times for caps that trade in the market today. In 
the United States, the most popular caps have quarterly resets, so that it is approximately 
true that t1=0.25, t2=0.5, t3=0.75, and so on. Define dk=tk+1-tk, and
Fk1t2:  Forward rate for the period between times tk and tk+1 as seen at time t16 tk2,  
expressed with a compounding period of dk and an actual/actual day count
m1t2:  Index for the next reset date at time t; this means that m1t2 is the smallest 
integer such that t…tm1t2
zk1t2: Volatility of Fk1t2 at time t.
Initially, we will assume that there is only one factor.
As shown in Section 28.4, in a world that is defined by the numeraire P1t, tk+12, Fk1t2 is  
a martingale and follows the process
 dFk1t2=zk1t2Fk1t2 dz (33.7)
where dz is a Wiener process.
The process for P1t, tk2 has the form
dP1t, tk2
P1t, tk2=g+vk1t2 dz
where vk1t2 is negative because bond prices and interest rates are negatively related.
In practice, it is often most convenient to value interest rate derivatives by working in  
a world that is always defined by the numeraire equal to a bond maturing at the next  
reset date. We refer to this as a rolling risk-neutral world because the numeraire changes 
as we roll forward.5 In this world we can discount from time tk+1 to time tk using the  
zero rate observed at time tk for a maturity tk+1. We do not have to worry about what 
happens to interest rates between times tk and tk+1.
At time t, the rolling risk-neutral world is a world defined by the numeraire P1t, tm1t22. 
Equation (33.7) gives the process followed by Fk1t2 in a world defined by the numeraire 
P1t, tk+12. From Section 28.8, it follows that the process followed by Fk1t2 in the rolling 
risk-neutral world is 
dFk1t2=zk1t23vm1t21t2-vk+11t24Fk1t2 dt+zk1t2Fk1t2 dz (33.8)
The relationship between forward rates and bond prices is
P1t, ti2
P1t, ti+12=1+diFi1t2
or
ln P1t, ti2-ln P1t, ti+12=ln31+diFi1t24
5 In the terminology of Section 28.4, this world corresponds to using a “rolling CD” as the numeraire. A 
rolling CD (certificate of deposit) is one where we start with $1, buy a bond maturing at time t1, reinvest the  
proceeds at time t1 in a bond maturing at time t2, reinvest the proceeds at time t2 in a bond maturing at time  
t3, and so on. (Strictly speaking, the interest rate trees we constructed in Chapter 32 are in a rolling risk- 
neutral world rather than the traditional risk-neutral world.) The numeraire is a CD rolled over at the end of  
each time step.
M33_HULL0654_11_GE_C33.indd   759 30/04/2021   17:51760 CHAPTER 33
Itô’s lemma can be used to calculate the process followed by both the left-hand side and 
the right-hand side of this equation. Equating the coefficients of dz gives6
 vi1t2-vi+11t2=diFi1t2zi1t2
1+diFi1t2 (33.9)
so that from equation (33.8) the process followed by Fk1t2 in the rolling risk-neutral 
world is
 dFk1t2
Fk1t2=ak
i=m1t2diFi1t2zi1t2zk1t2
1+diFi1t2 dt+zk1t2 dz (33.10)
The HJM result in equation (33.4) is the limiting case of this as the di tend to zero (see 
Problem 33.7).
Forward Rate Volatilities
The BGM model can be simplified by assuming that zk1t2 is a function only of the 
 number of whole accrual periods between the next reset date and time tk. Define Λi as  
the value of zk1t2 when there are i such accrual periods. This means that  
zk1t2=Λk-m1t2 is a step function.
The Λi are related to the volatilities used to price caplets in Black’s model. They can be 
thought of as forward values of those volatilities.7 Suppose that sk is the Black volatility 
for the caplet that corresponds to the period between times tk and tk+1 and that the rate 
for this period is determined at time tk. Equating variances, we must have
 s2
ktk=ak
i=1Λ2k-i di-1 (33.11)
This equation can be used to obtain the Λ’s iteratively.8
Example 33.1
Assume that the di are all equal and the Black caplet spot volatilities for the first 
three caplets are 24%, 22%, and 20%. This means that Λ0=24%. Since
Λ20+Λ21=2*0.222
Λ1 is 19.80%. Also, since
Λ20+Λ21+Λ22=3*0.202
Λ2 is 15.23%.
Example 33.2
Consider the data in Table 33.1 on caplet volatilities sk. These exhibit a hump. 
The ∂’s are shown in the second row. Notice that the hump in the Λ’s is more 
pronounced than the hump in the s’s.
8 When we are dealing with OIS rates, equation (33.11) can be modified to reflect the uncertainty associated 
with overnight rates between times tk and tk+1, as outlined in Section 29.2.7 In practice the ∂’s are determined using a least-squares calibration, as we will discuss later.6 Since the v’s and z’s have opposite signs, the bond price volatility becomes larger (in absolute terms) as the 
time to maturity increases. This is as expected.
M33_HULL0654_11_GE_C33.indd   760 30/04/2021   17:51Modeling Forward Rates 761
Implementation of the Model
The BGM model can be implemented using Monte Carlo simulation. Expressed in 
terms of the Λi’s, equation (33.10) is
 dFk1t2
Fk1t2=ak
i=m1t2diFi1t2Λi-m1t2Λk-m1t2
1+diFi1t2 dt+Λk-m1t2 dz (33.12)
so that from Itô’s lemma
   d ln Fk1t2=cak
i=m1t2diFi1t2Λi-m1t2Λk-m1t2
1+diFi1t2-1Λk-m1t222
2ddt+Λk-m1t2 dz (33.13)
If, as an approximation, we assume in the calculation of the drift of ln Fk1t2 that 
Fi1t2=Fi1tj2 for tj6t6tj+1, then
Fk1tj+12=Fk1tj2expcaak
i=j+1diFi1tj2Λi-j-1Λk-j-1
1+diFi1tj2-Λ2
k-j-1
2bdj+Λk-j-1P2djd 
 (33.14)
where P is a random sample from a normal distribution with mean equal to zero and 
standard deviation equal to one. In the Monte Carlo simulation, this equation is used 
to calculate forward rates at time t1 from those at time zero; it is then used to calculate 
forward rates at time t2 from those at time t1; and so on.
Extension to Several Factors
The BGM model can be extended to incorporate several independent factors. Suppose that there are p factors and 
zk,q is the component of the volatility of Fk1t2 attributable to  
the qth factor. Equation (33.10) becomes (see Problem 33.11)
 dFk1t2
Fk1t2=ak
i=m1t2diFi1t2ap
q=1zi,q1t2zk,q1t2
1+diFi1t2 dt+ap
q=1zk,q1t2 dzq (33.15)
Define li,q as the qth component of the volatility when there are i accrual periods 
between the next reset date and the maturity of the forward contract. Equation (33.14) Table 33.1  Volatility data; accrual period=1 year.

q=1l2

2bdj+ap
q=1lk-j-1,q Pq2djd
 (33.16)
where the Pq are random samples from a normal distribution with mean equal to zero 
and standard deviation equal to one.
The approximation that the drift of a forward rate remains constant within each 
accrual period allows us to jump from one reset date to the next in the simulation.  
This is convenient because as already mentioned the rolling risk-neutral world allows 
us to discount from one reset date to the next. Suppose that we wish to simulate a zero curve for N accrual periods. On each trial we start with the forward rates at time zero. These are 
F0102, F1102,c, FN-1102 and are calculated from the initial zero curve. 
Equation (33.16) is used to calculate F11t12, F21t12,c, FN-11t12. Equation (33.16) is 
then used again to calculate F21t22, F31t22,c, FN-11t22, and so on, until FN-11tN-12 is 
obtained. Note that as we move through time the zero curve gets shorter and shorter. For example, suppose each accrual period is 3 months and 
N=40. We start with a  
10-year zero curve. At the 6-year point (at time t24), the simulation gives us informa-
tion on a 4-year zero curve.
The drift approximation that we have used (i.e., Fi1t2=Fi1tj2 for tj6t6tj+1) can 
be tested by valuing caplets using equation (33.16) and comparing the prices to those given by Black’s model. The value of 
Fk1tk2 is the realized rate for the time period 
between tk and tk+1 and enables the caplet payoff at time tk+1 to be calculated. This 
payoff is discounted back to time zero, one accrual period at a time. The caplet value is  
the average of the discounted payoffs. The results of this type of analysis show that the cap values from Monte Carlo simulation are not significantly different from those given by Black’s model. This is true even when the accrual periods are 1 year in length and a  
very large number of trials is used.
9 This suggests that the drift approximation is 
 innocuous in most situations.
Ratchet Caps, Sticky Caps, and Flexi Caps
The BGM model can be used to value some types of nonstandard caps. Consider 
ratchet caps and sticky caps. These incorporate rules for determining how the cap rate for each caplet is set. In a ratchet cap it equals the rate at the previous reset date plus a  
spread. In a sticky cap it equals the previous capped rate plus a spread. Suppose that the  
cap rate at time 
tj is Kj, the rate at time tj is Rj, and the spread is s. In a ratchet cap, 
Kj+1=Rj+s. In a sticky cap, Kj+1=min1Rj, Kj2+s.
Tables 33.2 and 33.3 provide valuations of a ratchet cap and sticky cap using the 
BGM model with one, two, and three factors. The principal is $100. The term structure (for both discounting and determining payoffs) is assumed to be flat at 5% per annum continuously compounded, or 5.127% annually compounded, and the caplet volatilities

when the cap volatilities are very high.

are as in Table 33.1. The interest rate is reset annually. The spread is 25 basis points 
applied to the annually compounded rate. Tables 33.4 and 33.5 show how the volatility 
was split into components when two- and three-factor models were used. The results are  
based on 100,000 Monte Carlo simulations incorporating the antithetic variable  technique described in Section 21.7. The standard error of each price is about 0.001.
A third type of nonstandard cap is a flexi cap. This is like a regular cap except that 
there is a limit on the total number of caplets that can be exercised. Consider an annual- 
pay flexi cap when the principal is $100, the term structure is flat at 5%, and the cap  volatilities are as in Tables 33.1, 33.4, and 33.5. Suppose that all in-the-money caplets 
are exercised up to a maximum of five. With one, two, and three factors, the BGM 
model gives the price of the instrument as 3.43, 3.58, and 3.61, respectively (see  
Problem 33.14 for other types of flexi caps).Caplet start

The pricing of a plain vanilla cap depends only on the total volatility and is 
 independent of the number of factors. This is because the price of a plain vanilla caplet  
depends on the behavior of only one forward rate. The prices of caplets in the 
 nonstandard instruments we have looked at are different in that they depend on the 
joint probability distribution of several different forward rates. As a result they do depend on the number of factors.
Valuing European Swap Options
There is an analytic approximation for valuing European swap options in the BGM model.
10 Assume that the swap cash flows are based on risk-free rates (i.e., the rates used 
for discounting). Let T0 be the maturity of the swap option and assume that the payment 
dates for the swap are T1, T2, c, TN. Define ti=Ti+1-Ti. From equation (28.23), the 
swap rate at time t  is given by
s1t2=P1t, T02-P1t, TN2

approximations have been suggested by A. Brace, D. Gatarek, and M. Musiela “The Market Model of Interest Rate Dynamics,” Mathematical Finance, 7, 2 (1997): 127–55 and L. B. G. Andersen and J. Andreasen,

for 1…i…N, where Gj1t2 is the forward rate at time t  for the period between Tj  
and Tj+1. These two equations together define a relationship between s (t) and the Gj1t2.  
Applying Itô’s lemma (see Problem 33.12), the variance V(t) of the swap rate s(t) is 
given by
 V1t2=ap
q=1caN-1
k=0tkbk,q1t2Gk1t2gk1t2

and bj,q1t2 is the qth component of the volatility of Gj1t2. We approximate V1t2 by 
 setting Gj1t2=Gj102 for all j and t. The swap volatility that is substituted into the 
standard market model for valuing a swaption is then

In the situation where the length of the accrual period for the swap underlying the 
swaption is the same as the length of the accrual period for a cap, bk,q1t2 is the qth 
component of volatility of a cap forward rate when the time to maturity is Tk-t. This 
can be looked up in a table such as Table 33.5.
This valuation result for European swap options can be extended to the situation 
where each swap accrual period includes M subperiods that could be accrual periods in  
a typical cap. Define tj,m as the length of the mth subperiod in the jth accrual period 
so that
tj=aM
m=1tj,m
Define Gj,m1t2 as the forward rate observed at time t for the tj,m accrual period. Because
1+tjGj1t2=qM
m=131+tj,mGj,m1t24
the analysis leading to equation (33.18) can be modified so that the volatility of s (t) is 
obtained in terms of the volatilities of the Gj,m1t2 rather than the volatilities of the Gj1t2. 
The swap volatility to be substituted into the standard market model for valuing a swap option proves to be (see Problem 33.13)

Here bj,m,q1t2 is the q th component of the volatility of Gj,m1t2. It is the q th component  
of the volatility of a cap forward rate when the time to maturity is from t  to the 
 beginning of the mth subperiod in the 1Tj, Tj+12 swap accrual period.
The expressions (33.18) and (33.19) for the swap volatility do involve the approxima-
tions that Gj1t2=Gj102 and Gj,m1t2=Gj,m102. Hull and White compared the prices of 
European swap options calculated using (33.18) and (33.19) with the prices calculated 
from a Monte Carlo simulation and found the two to be very close. Once the BGM model has been calibrated, (33.18) and (33.19) therefore provide a quick way of valuing European swap options. Analysts can determine whether European swap options are overpriced or underpriced relative to caps. As we shall see shortly, they can also use the  
results to calibrate the model to the market prices of swap options.
Calibrating the Model
The variable Λj is the volatility at time t of the forward rate Fj for the period between tk 
and tk+1 when there are j whole accrual periods between t and tk. To calibrate the BGM 
model, it is necessary to determine the Λj and how they are split into lj,q. The Λ’s are 
usually determined from current market data, whereas the split into l’s is determined 
from historical data.
Consider first the determination of the l’s from the Λ’s. A principal components 
analysis (see Section 22.9) on forward rate data can be used. The model is
∆Fj=aM
q=1aj,qxq
where M is the total number of factors (which equals the number of different forward 
rates), ∆Fj is the change in the jth forward rate Fj, aj,q is the factor loading for the jth 
forward rate and the qth factor, xq is the factor score for the qth factor. Define sq as the 
standard deviation of the qth factor score. If the number of factors used in the BGM model, p, is equal to the total number of factors, M, it is correct to set
lj, q=aj,q sq
for 1…j, q…M. When, as is usual, p6M, the lj,q must be scaled so that
Λj=4ap
q=1 l2
j,q
This involves setting
 lj, q=Λj sq aj,q
4ap
q=1s2
q a2
j,q (33.20)
Consider next the estimation of the Λ’s. Equation (33.11) provides one way that they  
can be theoretically determined so that they are consistent with caplet prices. In 
practice, this is not usually used because it often leads to wild swings in the Λ’s and 
sometimes there is no set of Λ’s exactly consistent with cap quotes. A commonly used 
calibration procedure is similar to that described in Section 32.6. Suppose that Ui is the 
M33_HULL0654_11_GE_C33.indd   766 30/04/2021   17:51Modeling Forward Rates 767
market price of the ith calibrating instrument (typically a cap or European swaption) 
and Vi is the model price. The Λ’s are chosen to minimize
a
i1Ui-Vi22+P
where P is a penalty function chosen to ensure that the Λ’s are “well behaved.” 
 Similarly to Section 32.6, P might have the form
P=a
iw1,i1Λi+1-Λi22+a
iw2,i1Λi+1+Λi-1-2Λi22
When the calibrating instrument is a European swaption, formulas (33.18) and (33.19) make the minimization feasible using the Levenberg–Marquardt procedure. Equa-tion ( 33.20) is used to determine the 
l’s from the Λ’s.
Volatility Skews
Brokers provide quotes on caps that are not at the money as well as on caps that are at the money. In some markets a volatility skew is observed, that is, the quoted (Black) volatility for a cap or a floor is a declining function of the strike price. This can be  handled using the CEV model. (See Section 27.1 for the application of the CEV model 
to equities.) The model is
 
dFi1t2=g+ap
q=1zi,q1t2Fi1t2a dzq (33.21)
where a is a constant 106a612. It turns out that this model can be handled very 
similarly to the lognormal model. Caps and floors can be valued analytically using the 
cumulative noncentral x2 distribution. There are similar analytic approximations to 
those given above for the prices of European swap options.11
Bermudan Swap Options
A popular interest rate derivative is a Bermudan swap option. This is a swap option that can be exercised on some or all of the payment dates of the underlying swap. Bermudan swap options are difficult to value using the BGM model because the BGM model relies on Monte Carlo simulation and it is difficult to evaluate early exercise decisions when Monte Carlo simulation is used. Fortunately, the procedures described in Section 27.8 can be used. Longstaff and Schwartz apply the least-squares approach when there are a large number of factors. The value of not exercising on a particular payment date is assumed to be a polynomial function of the values of the factors.
12 
Andersen shows that the optimal early exercise boundary approach can be used. He experiments with a number of ways of parameterizing the early exercise boundary and  
finds that good results are obtained when the early exercise decision is assumed to

depend only on the intrinsic value of the option.13 Most traders value Bermudan 
options using one of the one-factor no-arbitrage models discussed in Chapter 32. 
 However, the accuracy of one-factor models for pricing Bermudan swap options has 
been a controversial issue.14

One application of the models presented in this chapter is to the agency mortgage- 
backed security (agency MBS) market in the United States.
An agency MBS is similar to the ABS considered in Chapter 8 except that payments 
are guaranteed by a government-related agency such as the Government National  Mortgage Association (GNMA) or the Federal National Mortgage Association 
(FNMA) so that investors are protected against defaults. This makes an agency MBS sound like a regular fixed-income security issued by the government. In fact, there is a critical difference between an agency MBS and a regular fixed-income investment. This difference is that the mortgages in an agency MBS pool have prepayment privileges. These prepayment privileges can be quite valuable to the householder. In the United States, mortgages typically last for 30 years and can be prepaid at any time. This means that the householder has a 30-year American-style option to put the mortgage back to the lender at its face value.
Prepayments on mortgages occur for a variety of reasons. Sometimes interest rates fall 
and the owner of the house decides to refinance at a lower rate. On other occasions, a mortgage is prepaid simply because the house is being sold. A critical element in valuing an agency MBS is the determination of what is known as the prepayment function. This is  
a function describing expected prepayments on the underlying pool of mortgages at a time t in terms of the yield curve at time t  and other relevant variables.
A prepayment function is very unreliable as a predictor of actual prepayment 
 experience for an individual mortgage. When many similar mortgage loans are com-
bined in the same pool, there is a “law of large numbers” effect at work and  
prepayments can be predicted more accurately from an analysis of historical data. As mentioned, prepayments are not always motivated by pure interest rate considerations. Nevertheless, there is a tendency for prepayments to be more likely when interest rates are low than when they are high. This means that investors require a higher rate of interest on an agency MBS than on other fixed-income securities to compensate for the prepayment options they have written.
Collateralized Mortgage Obligations
The simplest type of agency MBS is referred to as a pass-through. All investors receive  
the same return and bear the same prepayment risk. Not all mortgage-backed  securities work in this way. In a collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) the investors  
M33_HULL0654_11_GE_C33.indd   768 30/04/2021   17:51Modeling Forward Rates 769
are divided into a number of classes and rules are developed for determining how 
 principal repayments are channeled to different classes. A CMO creates classes of 
 securities that bear different amounts of prepayment risk in the same way that the 
ABS considered in Chapter 8 creates classes of securities bearing different amounts of credit risk.
As an example of a CMO, consider an agency MBS where investors are divided into 
three classes: class A, class B, and class C. All the principal repayments (both those that are scheduled and those that are prepayments) are channeled to class A investors until  
investors in this class have been completely paid off. Principal repayments are then channeled to class B investors until these investors have been completely paid off.  
Finally, principal repayments are channeled to class C investors. In this situation, class A investors bear the most prepayment risk. The class A securities can be expected to last for a shorter time than the class B securities, and these, in turn, can be expected to last less long than the class C securities.
The objective of this type of structure is to create classes of securities that are more 
attractive to institutional investors than those created by a simpler pass-through MBS. The prepayment risks assumed by the different classes depend on the par value in each class. For example, class C bears very little prepayment risk if the par values in classes A, B, and C are 400, 300, and 100, respectively. Class C bears rather more prepayment risk in the situation where the par values in the classes are 100, 200, and 500.
The creators of mortgage-backed securities have created many more exotic structures 
than the one we have just described. Business Snapshot 33.1 gives an example.
Valuing Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities
Agency MBSs are usually valued by modeling the behavior of Treasury rates using Monte Carlo simulation. The HJM/BGM approach can be used. Consider what  happens on one simulation trial. Each month, expected prepayments are calculated 
from the current yield curve and the history of yield curve movements. These prepay-ments determine the expected cash flows to the holder of the agency MBS and the cash flows are discounted at the Treasury rate plus a spread to time zero to obtain a sample  Business Snapshot 33.1 IOs and POs
In what is known as a stripped MBS, principal payments are separated from interest payments. All principal payments are channeled to one class of security, known as a principal only (PO). All interest payments are channeled to another class of security  
known as an interest only (IO). Both IOs and POs are risky investments. As  prepayment rates increase, a PO becomes more valuable and an IO becomes less 
valuable. As prepayment rates decrease, the reverse happens. In a PO, a fixed amount  
of principal is returned to the investor, but the timing is uncertain. A high rate of  
 prepayments on the underlying pool leads to the principal being received early (which 
is, of course, good news for the holder of the PO). A low rate of prepayments on the underlying pool delays the return of the principal and reduces the yield provided by the PO. In the case of an IO, the total of the cash flows received by the investor is uncertain. The higher the rate of prepayments, the lower the total cash flows received by the investor, and vice versa.
M33_HULL0654_11_GE_C33.indd   769 30/04/2021   17:51770 CHAPTER 33
value for the agency MBS. An estimate of the value of the agency MBS is the average of 
the sample values over many simulation trials.
Option-Adjusted Spread
In addition to calculating theoretical prices for mortgage-backed securities and other bonds with embedded options, traders also like to compute what is known as the  
option-adjusted spread (OAS). This is a measure of the spread over the yields on  government Treasury bonds provided by the instrument when all options have been 
taken into account.
To calculate an OAS for an instrument, it is priced as described above using Treasury 
rates plus a spread for discounting. The price of the instrument given by the model is compared to the price in the market. A series of iterations is then used to determine the value of the spread that causes the model price to be equal to the market price. This spread is the OAS.
SUMMARY
The HJM and BGM models provide approaches to valuing interest rate derivatives that  
give the user complete freedom in choosing the volatility term structure. The BGM model has two key advantages over the HJM model. First, it is developed in terms of the forward rates that determine the pricing of caps, rather than in terms of instantaneous forward rates. Second, it is relatively easy to calibrate to the price of caps or European swap options. The HJM and BGM models both have the disadvantage that they cannot be represented as recombining trees. In practice, this means that they must usually be implemented using Monte Carlo simulation and require much more computation time than the models in Chapter 32.
The agency mortgage-backed security market in the United States has given birth to 
many exotic interest rate derivatives: CMOs, IOs, POs, and so on. These instruments  
provide cash flows to the holder that depend on the prepayments on a pool of  mortgages. These prepayments depend on, among other things, the level of interest 
rates. Because they are heavily path dependent, agency mortgage-backed securities usually have to be valued using Monte Carlo simulation. These are, therefore, ideal candidates for applications of the HJM and BGM models.

(a) The holder can choose whether any caplet is exercised, but there is a limit of N on 
the total number of caplets that can be exercised.
(b) Once the holder chooses to exercise a caplet all subsequent in-the-money caplets must be exercised up to a maximum of N.
Discuss the problems in valuing these types of flexi caps. Of the three types of flexi  
caps, which would you expect to be most expensive? Which would you expect to be least expensive?

Swaps Revisited34 CHAPTER  
Swaps have been central to the success of over-the-counter derivatives markets. They 
have proved to be very flexible instruments for managing risk. Based on the range of different contracts that now trade and the total volume of business transacted each year, swaps are arguably one of the most successful innovations in financial markets ever.
Chapter 7 discussed how plain vanilla interest rate swaps can be valued. The standard 
approach can be summarized as: “Assume forward rates will be realized.” The steps are as follows:
1. Calculate the swap’s net cash flows on the assumption that rates in the future equal the forward rates calculated from instruments trading in the market today.
2. Set the value of the swap equal to the present value of the net cash flows using a risk-free (OIS) rate.
This chapter describes a number of nonstandard swaps. Some can be valued using the “assume forward rates will be realized” approach; some require the application of the  
convexity, timing, and quanto adjustments we encountered in Chapter 30; some  contain embedded options that must be valued using the procedures described in 
Chapters 29, 32, and 33.
34.1 VARIATIONS ON THE VANILLA DEAL
Many interest rate swaps involve relatively minor variations to the plain vanilla  structure discussed in Chapter 7. In some swaps the notional principal changes with 
time in a predetermined way. Swaps where the notional principal is an increasing function of time are known as step-up swaps. Swaps where the notional principal is a decreasing function of time are known as amortizing swaps. Step-up swaps could be  
useful for a construction company that intends to borrow increasing amounts of money at floating rates to finance a particular project and wants to swap to fixed-rate  
funding. An amortizing swap could be used by a company that has fixed-rate  borrowings with a certain prepayment schedule and wants to swap to borrowings at 
a floating rate.
M34_HULL0654_11_GE_C34.indd   773 30/04/2021   17:52774 CHAPTER 34
The principal can be different on the two sides of a swap. Also the frequency of 
 payments can be different. Business Snapshot 34.1 illustrates this by showing a hypo-
thetical swap between Microsoft and Goldman Sachs where the notional principal is 
$120 million on the floating side and $100 million on fixed side. Payments are made every three months on the floating side and every 6 months on the fixed side. These type  
of variations to the basic plain vanilla structure do not affect the valuation method-ology. The “assume forward rates are realized” approach can still be used.
Traditionally LIBOR has been the most common floating reference rate in swaps. As 
LIBOR is phased out, it is likely that swaps based on overnight rates will become more common. (As explained in Chapter 7, a typical OIS transaction involves compounded daily overnight rates being exchanged for a fixed rate at the end of each three-month period.) Banks have indicated that they would like to be able to use a non-risk-free floating reference rate in transactions, and in time it is likely that an acceptable non-risk-free floating reference rate will be developed. Banks will then be able to trade swaps where the floating rate reflects credit spreads (which vary through time) as well as those where the floating rate is risk-free.
Whatever the floating reference rate, the “assume forward rates are realized approach” 
can be used in standard floating-for-fixed swaps. Cash flows are calculated based on  forward rates calculated from the yield curve for the floating reference rate and these are 
discounted at the risk-free (OIS) rate.Business Snapshot 34.1  Hypothetical Confirmation for Nonstandard Swap

34.2 COMPOUNDING SWAPS
Another variation on the plain vanilla swap is a compounding swap. A hypothetical 
confirmation for a compounding swap is in Business Snapshot 34.2. In this example there is only one payment date for both the floating-rate payments and the fixed-rate payments. This is at the end of the life of the swap. The floating rate of interest is SOFR plus 20 basis points. Instead of being paid, the interest is compounded forward until the  
end of the life of the swap at a rate of SOFR. The fixed rate of interest is 2% per  
annum. Instead of being paid this interest is compounded forward at a fixed rate of interest of 2.3% per annum until the end of the swap.
M34_HULL0654_11_GE_C34.indd   775 30/04/2021   17:52776 CHAPTER 34
The “assume forward rates are realized” approach can be used at least approximately 
for valuing a compounding swap such as that in Business Snapshot 34.2. It is straight- 
forward to deal with the fixed side of the swap because the payment that will be made at maturity is known with certainty. The “assume forward rates are realized” approach for  
the floating side is justifiable because there exist a series of forward rate agreements (FRAs) where the floating-rate cash flows are exchanged for the values they would have if each floating rate equaled the corresponding forward rate.
1
Example 34.1
A compounding swap with annual resets has a life of three years. A fixed rate is paid and a floating rate is received. The fixed interest rate is 4% and the floating reference interest rate is a 12-month rate. The fixed side compounds at 3.9% and  
the floating side compounds at the 12-month rate minus 20 basis points. All forward rates for the floating reference rate are 5%. OIS rates are all 4%. The notional principal is $100 million. (All rates are annually compounded.)
On the fixed side, interest of $4 million is earned at the end of the first year. 
This compounds to 
4*1.039=+4.156 million at the end of the second year.  
A second interest amount of $4 million is added at the end of the second year bringing the total compounded forward amount to $8.156 million. This com-pounds to 
8.156*1.039=+8.474 million by the end of the third year when there 
is the third interest amount of $4 million. The cash flow at the end of the third year on the fixed side of the swap is therefore $12.474 million.
On the floating side we assume all future interest rates equal the corresponding 
forward rates. This means that all future interest rates are assumed to be 5% with  
annual compounding. The interest calculated at the end of the first year is  
$5 million. Compounding this forward at 4.8% (forward rate minus 20 basis points) gives 
5*1.048=+5.24 million at the end of the second year. Adding 
in the interest, the compounded forward amount is $10.24 million.  Compounding 
forward to the end of the third year, we get 10.24*1.048=$10.731 million. 
 Adding in the final interest gives $15.731 million.
The swap can be valued by assuming that it leads to an inflow of $15.731 million 
and an outflow of $12.474 million at the end of year 3. The value of the swap is 
therefore
15.731-12.474
1.043=2.895
or $2.895 million. (This analysis ignores day count issues and makes the approx-imation indicated in footnote 1.)
1 See Technical Note 18 at www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull/TechnicalNotes for the details. The “assume 
forward rates are realized” approach works exactly if the spread used for compounding, sc, is zero or if it is 
applied so that Q at time t compounds to Q11+Rt211+sct2 at time t+t, where R is LIBOR. If, as is more 
usual, it compounds to Q31+1R+sc2t4, then there is a small approximation.34.3 CURRENCY AND NONSTANDARD SWAPS
Currency swaps were introduced in Chapter 7. They enable an interest rate exposure in one currency to be swapped for an interest rate exposure in another currency. Usually 
M34_HULL0654_11_GE_C34.indd   776 30/04/2021   17:52Swaps Revisited 777
two principals are specified, one in each currency. The principals are exchanged at both 
the beginning and the end of the life of the swap as described in Section 7.7.
Suppose that the currencies involved in a currency swap are U.S. dollars (USD) and 
British pounds (GBP). In a fixed-for-fixed currency swap, a fixed rate of interest is specified in each currency. The payments on one side are determined by applying the fixed rate of interest in USD to the USD principal; the payments on the other side are determined by applying the fixed rate of interest in GBP to the GBP principal.
In a floating-for-floating currency swap, the payments on one side are determined by  
applying a USD floating rate (possibly with a spread added) to the USD principal;  similarly the payments on the other side are determined by applying a GBP floating rate 
(possibly with a spread added) to the GBP principal. In a cross-currency interest rate swap, a floating rate in one currency is exchanged for a fixed rate in another currency.
Floating-for-floating and cross-currency interest rate swaps can be valued using the 
“assume forward rates are realized” rule. Future rates in each currency are assumed to  
equal today’s forward rates. This enables the cash flows in the currencies to be  determined. The USD cash flows are discounted at the USD zero rate. The GBP cash 
flows are discounted at the GBP zero rate. The current exchange rate is then used to translate the two present values to a common currency.
It is important to ensure that valuation procedures are such that transactions that 
could be negotiated today (at the midpoint of bid and ask) have zero value. The  discount rates that are used are often adjusted to ensure that this is the case.
2
The results in Chapter 30 indicate that the “assume forward rates will be realized” 
approach to valuation does not always work. It must be replaced by “assume adjusted 
forward rates will be realized.” If payments on a swap depend on a bond yield or a swap rate, equation (30.1) can be used to determine adjusted forward rates. If timing differences are involved in the determination of payments, equation (30.3) can be used to determine adjusted forward rates. A swap where an interest rate in one currency is applied to a principal in another currency is known as a differential swap or diff swap. In this case the quanto adjustment in equation (30.5) is necessary to determine adjusted forward rates.
2 If a bank’s system does not value deals consistently with the market, its traders will be able to arbitrage 
the system.34.4 EQUITY SWAPS
In an equity swap, one party promises to pay the return on an equity index on a notional principal, while the other promises to pay a fixed or floating return on a notional principal. Equity swaps enable a fund managers to increase or reduce their exposure to an index without buying and selling stock. An equity swap is a convenient way of packaging a series of forward contracts on an index to meet the needs of the market participants.
The equity index is usually a total return index where dividends are reinvested in the 
stocks comprising the index. An example of an equity swap is in Business Snapshot 34.3.  
In this, the 3-month return on the S&P 500 is exchanged for 3-month SOFR. The  principal on either side of the swap is $100 million and payments are made every  
3 months.
M34_HULL0654_11_GE_C34.indd   777 30/04/2021   17:52778 CHAPTER 34
For an equity-for-floating swap such as that in Business Snapshot 34.3, the value at 
the start of its life is zero. This is because a financial institution can in theory arrange to  
costlessly replicate the cash flows to one side by borrowing the principal on each 
 payment date and investing it in the index until the next payment date with any 
 dividends being reinvested. A similar argument shows that the swap is always worth 
zero immediately after a payment date.
Between payment dates the equity cash flow and the floating cash flow at the next 
payment date must be valued. The next floating cash flow can be valued from the  overnight rates already observed and a forward rate for the remaining time until the 
next payment calculated from the SOFR zero curve. The value of the next equity cash flow is 
L1E-E02>E0, where L is the principal, E is the current value of the equity 
index, and E0 is its value at the last payment date.3Business Snapshot 34.3 Hypothetical Confirmation for an Equity Swap

Some swaps contain embedded options. In this section we consider some commonly 
encountered examples.
Accrual Swaps
Accrual swaps are swaps where the interest on one side accrues only when the floating reference rate is within a certain range. Sometimes the range remains fixed during the entire life of the swap; sometimes it is reset periodically.
As a simple example of an accrual swap, consider a deal where a fixed rate Q is 
exchanged for compounded SOFR every quarter and the fixed rate accrues only on days when SOFR is below 2% per annum. Suppose that the principal is L. In a normal swap the fixed-rate payer would pay 
QLn1>n2 on each payment date where n1 is the number 
of days in the preceding quarter and n2 is the number of days in the year. (This assumes 
that the day count is actual/actual.) In an accrual swap, this is changed to QLn3>n2, 
where n3 is the number of days in the preceding quarter that SOFR was below 2%. The 
fixed-rate payer saves QL>n2 on each day when SOFR is above 2%.4 The fixed-rate 
payer’s position can therefore be considered equivalent to a regular swap plus a series of  
binary options, one for each day of the life of the swap. The binary options pay off  
QL>n2 when SOFR is above 2%.
To generalize, suppose that the cutoff rate (2% in the case just considered) is RK.  
Consider day i during the life of the swap and suppose that ti is the time until day i. 
Suppose that the interest accrues when Ri6RK where Ri is a floating reference interest 
rate for the period between ti and t i + τ. Define Fi as the forward value of Ri and si as 
the volatility of Fi. Making the usual lognormal assumption, the probability that Ri is 
greater than RK in a world defined by a numeraire equal to a zero-coupon bond maturing 
at time t i + τ is N1d22, where
d2=ln1Fi>RK2-s2
iti>2
si1ti
The payoff from the binary option is realized at the swap payment date following day i . 
Suppose that this is at time si. The probability that SOFR is greater than RK in a world 
defined by a numeraire equal to a zero-coupon bond maturing at time si is given by 
N1d*
22, where d*
2 is calculated using the same formula as d2, but with a small timing 
adjustment to Fi reflecting the difference between time t i + τ and time si.
The value of the binary option corresponding to day i is
QL
n2P10, si2N1d*
22
where P10, t2 as usual is the price of a risk-free zero-coupon bond maturing at time t. 
The total value of the binary options is obtained by summing this expression for every 
day in the life of the swap. The timing adjustment (causing d2 to be replaced by d*
2) is so 
small that, in practice, it is frequently ignored.34.5 SWAPS WITH EMBEDDED OPTIONS
4 The usual convention is that, if a day is a holiday, the applicable rate is assumed to be the rate on the 
immediately preceding business day.
M34_HULL0654_11_GE_C34.indd   779 30/04/2021   17:52780 CHAPTER 34
Cancelable Swap
A cancelable swap is a plain vanilla interest rate swap where one side has the option to 
terminate on one or more payment dates. Terminating a swap is the same as entering into the offsetting (opposite) swap. Consider a swap between Microsoft and Goldman Sachs. If Microsoft has the option to cancel, it can regard the swap as a regular swap plus a long position in an option to enter into the offsetting swap. If Goldman Sachs has the cancelation option, Microsoft has a regular swap plus a short position in an option to enter into the swap.
If there is only one termination date, a cancelable swap is the same as a regular swap 
plus a position in a European swaption. Consider, for example, a 10-year swap where  
Microsoft will receive 6% and pay a floating rate. Suppose that Microsoft has the option to terminate at the end of 6 years. The swap is a regular 10-year swap to receive 6% and pay floating plus a long position in a 6-year European option to enter into a 4-year swap where 6% is paid and floating is received. (The latter is referred to as a 
6*4 European swaption.) The standard market model for valuing European swap-
tions is described in Chapter 29.
When the swap can be terminated on a number of different payment dates, it is a 
regular swap plus a Bermudan-style swaption. Consider, for example, the situation where Microsoft has entered into a 5-year swap with semiannual payments where 6% is received and a floating rate is paid. Suppose that the counterparty has the option to terminate the swap on payment dates between year 2 and year 5. The swap is a regular swap plus a short position in a Bermudan-style swaption, where the Bermudan-style swaption is an option to enter into a swap that matures in 5 years and involves a fixed payment at 6% being received and floating being paid. The swaption can be exercised  
on any payment date between year 2 and year 5. Methods for valuing Bermudan  swaptions are discussed in Chapters 32 and 33.
Cancelable Compounding Swaps
Sometimes compounding swaps can be terminated on specified payment dates. On 
 termination, the floating-rate payer pays the compounded value of the floating amounts 
up to the time of termination and the fixed-rate payer pays the compounded value of the fixed payments up to the time of termination.
Some tricks can be used to value cancelable compounding swaps. Suppose first that 
the floating rate is a risk-free rate (such as compounded SOFR or SONIA) and it is compounded at the risk-free rate. Assume that the principal amount of the swap is  
paid on both the fixed and floating sides of the swap at the end of its life. This is similar to moving from Table 7.1 to Table 7.2 for a vanilla swap. It does not change the value of the swap and has the effect of ensuring that the value of the floating side always equals the notional principal immediately after a payment date. To make the cancelation decision, we need only look at the fixed side. We construct an interest rate tree as outlined in Chapter 32. We roll back through the tree in the usual way valuing  
the fixed side. At each node where the swap can be canceled, we test whether it is  optimal to keep the swap or cancel it. Canceling the swap in effect sets the fixed side 
equal to par. If we are paying fixed and receiving floating, our objective is to minimize the value of the fixed side; if we are receiving fixed and paying floating, our objective is to maximize the value of the fixed side.
M34_HULL0654_11_GE_C34.indd   780 30/04/2021   17:52Swaps Revisited 781
When the floating side is the risk-free rate plus a spread compounded at the risk-free 
rate, the cash flows corresponding to the spread rate of interest can be subtracted from 
the fixed side instead of adding them to the floating side. The option can then be valued as in the case where there is no spread.
When the compounding is at the risk-free rate plus a spread, an approximate 
approach is as follows:
5
1. Calculate the value of the floating side of the swap at each cancelation date  assuming forward rates are realized.
2. Calculate the value of the floating side of the swap at each cancelation date 
 assuming that the floating rate is the risk-free rate and it is compounded at the 
risk-free rate.
3. Define the excess of step 1 over step 2 as the “value of spreads” on a cancelation date.
4. Treat the option in the way described above. In deciding whether to exercise the 
cancelation option, subtract the value of the spreads from the values calculated for the fixed side.
5 This approach is not perfectly accurate in that it assumes that the decision to exercise the cancelation 
option is not influenced by future payments being compounded at a rate different from the floating rate.34.6 OTHER SWAPS
This chapter has discussed just a few of the swap structures in the market. In practice, the range of different contracts that trade is limited only by the imagination of financial engineers and the appetite of corporate treasurers for innovative risk management tools.
A swap that was very popular in the United States in the mid-1990s is an index 
 amortizing rate swap (also called an indexed principal swap). In this, the principal 
reduces in a way dependent on the level of interest rates. The lower the interest rate, the greater the reduction in the principal. The fixed side of an indexed amortizing swap was originally designed to mirror approximately the return obtained by an investor on an agency mortgage-backed security after prepayment options are taken into account.  
The swap therefore exchanged the return on the mortgage-backed security for a  floating-rate return.
Commodity swaps are now becoming increasingly popular. A company that consumes 
100,000 barrels of oil per year could agree to pay $5 million each year for the next  
10 years and to receive in return 100,000S, where S is the market price of oil per barrel. The agreement would in effect lock in the company’s oil cost at $50 per barrel. An oil producer might agree to the opposite exchange, thereby locking in the price it realized  
for its oil at $50 per barrel. Energy derivatives such as this will be discussed in Chapter 35.
A number of other types of swaps are discussed elsewhere in this book. For example, 
asset swaps are discussed in Chapter 24, total return swaps and various types of credit default swaps are covered in Chapter 25, and volatility and variance swaps are analyzed in Chapter 26.
M34_HULL0654_11_GE_C34.indd   781 30/04/2021   17:52782 CHAPTER 34
Bizarre Deals
Some swaps have payoffs that are calculated in quite bizarre ways. An example is a deal 
entered into between Procter and Gamble and Bankers Trust in 1993 (see Business Snapshot 34.4). The details of this transaction are in the public domain because it later 
became the subject of litigation.

SUMMARY
Swaps have proved to be very versatile financial instruments. Many swaps can be  valued  
by (a) assuming that the floating reference rate will equal its forward value and  
(b)  discounting the resulting cash flows. These include plain vanilla interest swaps, most 
types of currency swaps, swaps where the principal changes in a predetermined way, swaps where the payment dates are different on each side, and compounding swaps.
Some swaps require the adjustments to the forward rates discussed in Chapter 30 
when they are valued. These adjustments are termed convexity, timing, or quanto adjustments.Business Snapshot 34.4 Procter and Gamble’s Bizarre Deal
A particularly bizarre swap is the so-called “5> 30” swap entered into between Bankers 
Trust (BT) and Procter and Gamble (P&G) on November 2, 1993. This was a 5-year swap with semiannual payments. The notional principal was $200 million. BT paid P&G 5.30% per annum. P&G paid BT the average 30-day CP (commercial paper)  
rate minus 75 basis points plus a spread. The average commercial paper rate was  calculated by taking observations on the 30-day commercial paper rate each day 
during the preceding accrual period and averaging them.
The spread was zero for the first payment date (May 2, 1994). For the remaining 
nine payment dates, it was
max≥0, 98.5a5@year CMT%
5.78%b-130@year TSY price2
100¥
In this, 5-year CMT is the constant maturity Treasury yield (i.e., the yield on a 5-year Treasury note, as reported by the U.S. Federal Reserve). The 30-year TSY price is the midpoint of the bid and ask cash bond prices for the 6.25% Treasury bond maturing  
on August 2023. Note that the spread calculated from the formula is a decimal  interest rate. It is not measured in basis points. If the formula gives 0.1 and the CP 
rate is 6%, the rate paid by P&G is 15.25%.
P&G were hoping that the spread would be zero and the deal would enable it to  
exchange fixed-rate funding at 5.30% for funding at 75 basis points less than the commercial paper rate. In fact, interest rates rose sharply in early 1994, bond prices fell, and the swap proved very, very expensive (see Problem 34.7).

Leveraged Swap,” Journal of Derivatives 4, 4 (Summer 1997): 67–79.

Equity swaps involve the return on an equity index being exchanged for a fixed or 
floating rate of interest. They are usually designed so that they are worth zero immediately 
after a payment date, but they may have nonzero values between payment dates.
Some swaps involve embedded options. An accrual swap is a regular swap plus a 
large portfolio of binary options (one for each day of the life of the swap). A cancelable swap is a regular swap plus a Bermudan swaption.

 34.2. Suppose that a swap specifies that a fixed rate is exchanged for twice a floating rate. Can the swap be valued using the “assume forward rates are realized” rule?
 34.3.  What is the value of a 2-year fixed-for-floating compounding swap where the principal is $100 million and payments are made semiannually? Fixed interest is received and floating is paid. The fixed rate is 3% per annum and fixed cash flows are compounded every six  
months at a rate of 3.3% per annum. (Both the 3% and 3.3% are expressed with  semiannual compounding.) The floating rate is a risk-free rate plus 10 basis points and 
it is compounded at the risk-free rate plus 20 basis points. The risk-free zero curve is flat at 3% with semiannual compounding.
 34.4. What is the value of a 5-year swap where a risk-free floating rate is paid in the usual way and in return the risk-free rate compounded at the risk-free rate is received on the other side? The principal on both sides is $100 million. Payment dates on the pay side and compounding dates on the receive side are every 3 months. The risk-free zero curve is flat at 2% with quarterly compounding.
 34.5. In the accrual swap discussed in the text, the fixed side accrues only when the floating  
reference rate lies below a certain level. Discuss how the analysis can be extended to cope with a situation where the fixed side accrues only when the floating reference rate is between two levels.
 34.6. Risk-free zero rates are flat at 2% in the United States and flat at 5% in Australia (both annually compounded). In a 4-year diff swap the Australian floating risk-free rate is received and 4% is paid, with both being applied to a USD principal of $10 million.  
Payments are exchanged annually. The volatility of all 1-year forward rates in Australia is  
estimated to be 25%, the volatility of the forward USD/AUD exchange rate (AUD per USD) is 15% for all maturities, and the correlation between the two is 0.3. What is the  
value of the swap?

35 CHAPTER  Energy and 
Commodity 
Derivatives
The variable underlying a derivative is sometimes simply referred to as the underlying. 
Earlier parts of this book have focused on situations where the underlying is a stock price, a stock index, an exchange rate, a bond price, an interest rate, or the loss from a credit event. In this chapter, we consider a variety of other underlyings.
The first part of the chapter is concerned with situations where the underlying is a 
commodity. Chapter 2 discussed futures contracts on commodities and Chapter 18 discussed how European and American options on commodity futures contracts can be valued. As a European futures option has the same payoff as a European spot option when the futures contract matures at the same time as the option, the model  
used to value European futures options (Black’s model) can also be used to value European spot options. However, American spot options and other more complicated derivatives dependent on the spot price of a commodity require more sophisticated models. A feature of commodity prices is that they often exhibit mean reversion (similarly to interest rates) and are also sometimes subject to jumps. Some of the models developed for interest rates can be adapted to apply to commodities.
The second part of the chapter considers weather and insurance derivatives. A 
distinctive feature of these derivatives is that they depend on variables with no systematic risk. For example, the expected value of the temperature at a certain location or the losses experienced due to hurricanes can reasonably be assumed to be the same in a risk- neutral world and the real world. This means that historical data is potentially more useful for valuing these types of derivatives than for some others.
Agricultural commodities include products that are grown (or created from products 
that are grown) such as corn, wheat, soybeans, cocoa, coffee, sugar, cotton, and frozen orange juice. They also include products related to livestock such as cattle, hogs, and pork bellies. The prices of agricultural commodities, like all commodities, is determined by supply and demand. The U.S. Department of Agriculture publishes reports on  
inventories and production. One statistic that is watched for commodities such as corn 
35.1 AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES
M35_HULL0654_11_GE_C35.indd   785 30/04/2021   17:53786 CHAPTER 35
and wheat is the stocks-to-use ratio. This is the ratio of the year-end inventory to the 
year’s usage. Typically it is between 20% and 40%. It has an impact on price volatility. As the ratio for a commodity becomes lower, the commodity’s price becomes more sensitive to supply changes, so that the volatility increases.
There are reasons for supposing some level of mean reversion in agricultural prices. 
As prices decline, farmers find it less attractive to produce the commodity and supply decreases creating upward pressure on the price. Similarly, as the price of an agricul-tural commodity increases, farmers are more likely to devote resources to producing the commodity creating downward pressure on the price.
Prices of agricultural commodities tend to be seasonal, as storage is expensive and 
there is a limit to the length of time for which a product can be stored. Weather plays a key role in determining the price of many agricultural products. Frosts can decimate the Brazilian coffee crop, a hurricane in Florida is likely to have a big effect on the price of frozen orange juice, and so on. The volatility of the price of a commodity that is grown tends to be highest at pre-harvest times and then declines when the size of the crop is known. During the growing season, the price process for an agricultural commodity is liable to exhibit jumps because of the weather.
Many of the commodities that are grown and traded are used to feed livestock. (For 
example, the corn futures contract that is traded by the CME Group refers to the corn that is used to feed animals.) The price of livestock, and when slaughtering takes place, is liable to be dependent on the price of these commodities, which are in turn influenced by the weather.
Another important commodity category is metals. This includes gold, silver, platinum, 
palladium, copper, tin, lead, zinc, nickel, and aluminum. Metals have quite different characteristics from agricultural commodities. Their prices are unaffected by the weather and are not seasonal. They are extracted from the ground. They are divisible and are relatively easy to store. Some metals, such as copper, are used almost entirely in the manufacture of goods and should be classified as consumption assets. As explained in Section 5.1, others, such as gold and silver, are held purely for investment as well as for consumption and should be classified as investment assets.
As in the case of agricultural commodities, analysts monitor inventory levels to 
determine short-term price volatility. Exchange rate volatility may also contribute to volatility as the country where the metal is extracted is often different from the country  
in whose currency the price is quoted. In the long term, the price of a metal is determined by trends in the extent to which a metal is used in different production processes and new sources of the metal that are found. Changes in exploration and extraction methods, geopolitics, cartels, and environmental regulation also have an impact.
One potential source of supply for a metal is recycling. A metal might be used to 
create a product and, over the following 20 years, 10% of the metal might come back on the market as a result of a recycling process.
Metals that are investment assets are not usually assumed to follow mean-reverting 
processes because a mean-reverting process would give rise to an arbitrage opportunity for the investor. For metals that are consumption assets, there may be some mean 
35.2 METALS
M35_HULL0654_11_GE_C35.indd   786 30/04/2021   17:53Energy and Commodity Derivatives 787
reversion. As the price of a metal increases, it is likely to become less attractive to use 
the metal in some production processes and more economically viable to extract the metal from difficult locations. As a result there will be downward pressure on the price.  
Similarly, as the price decreases, it is likely to become more attractive to use the metal in some production processes and less economically viable to extract the metal from difficult locations. As a result, there will be upward pressure on the price.
Energy products are among the most important and actively traded commodities. 
A wide range of energy derivatives trade in both the over-the-counter market and on exchanges. Here we consider oil, natural gas, and electricity. There are reasons for supposing that all three follow mean reverting processes. As the price of a source of energy rises, it is likely to be consumed less and and produced more. This creates a downward pressure on prices. As the price of a source of energy declines, it is likely to be consumed more, but production is likely to be less economically viable. This creates upward pressure on the price.
Crude Oil
The crude oil market is the largest commodity market in the world, with global demand amounting to about 90 million barrels daily. Ten-year fixed-price supply contracts have been commonplace in the over-the-counter market for many years. These are swaps where oil at a fixed price is exchanged for oil at a floating price.
There are many grades of crude oil, reflecting variations in the gravity and the sulfur 
content. Two important benchmarks for pricing are Brent crude oil (which is sourced from the North Sea) and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil. Crude oil is refined into products such as gasoline, heating oil, fuel oil, and kerosene.
In the over-the-counter market, virtually any derivative that is available on common 
stocks or stock indices is now available with oil as the underlying asset. Swaps, forward contracts, and options are popular. Contracts sometimes require settlement in cash and sometimes require settlement by physical delivery (i.e., by delivery of oil).
Exchange-traded contracts are also popular. The CME Group and Intercontinental 
Exchange (ICE) trade a number of oil futures and oil futures options contracts. Some of the futures contracts are settled in cash; others are settled by physical delivery. For example, the Brent crude oil futures traded on ICE have a cash settlement option; the light sweet crude oil futures traded on CME Group require physical delivery. In both cases, the amount of oil underlying one contract is 1,000 barrels. The CME Group also trades popular contracts on two refined products: heating oil and gasoline. In both  
cases, one contract is for the delivery of 42,000 gallons.
Natural Gas
The natural gas industry throughout the world went through a period of deregulation and the elimination of government monopolies in the 1980s and 1990s. The supplier of  
natural gas is now not necessarily the same company as the producer of the gas.  
Suppliers are faced with the problem of meeting daily demand.35.3 ENERGY PRODUCTS
M35_HULL0654_11_GE_C35.indd   787 30/04/2021   17:53788 CHAPTER 35
A typical over-the-counter contract is for the delivery of a specified amount of  
natural gas at a roughly uniform rate over a 1-month period. Forward contracts,  
options, and swaps are available in the over-the-counter market. The seller of natural 
gas is usually responsible for moving the gas through pipelines to the specified  
location.
The CME Group trades a contract for the delivery of 10,000 million British thermal 
units of natural gas. The contract, if not closed out, requires physical delivery to be made during the delivery month at a roughly uniform rate to a particular hub in Louisiana. ICE trades a similar contract in London.
Natural gas is a popular source of energy for heating buildings. It is also used to 
produce electricity, which in turn is used for air-conditioning. As a result, demand for natural gas is seasonal and dependent on the weather.
Electricity
Electricity is an unusual commodity because it cannot easily be stored.1 The maximum 
supply of electricity in a region at any moment is determined by the maximum capacity of all the electricity-producing plants in the region. In the United States there are 140 regions known as control areas. Demand and supply are first matched within a 
control area, and any excess power is sold to other control areas. It is this excess power that constitutes the wholesale market for electricity. The ability of one control area to sell power to another control area depends on the transmission capacity of the lines between the two areas. Transmission from one area to another involves a transmission cost, charged by the owner of the line, and there are generally some transmission or energy losses.
A major use of electricity is for air-conditioning systems. As a result the demand for 
electricity, and therefore its price, is much greater in the summer months than in the winter months. The nonstorability of electricity causes occasional very large movements in the spot price. Heat waves have been known to increase the spot price by as much as 1,000% for short periods of time.
Like natural gas, electricity has been through a period of deregulation and the 
elimination of government monopolies. This has been accompanied by the development  
of an electricity derivatives market. The CME Group now trades a futures contract on  
the price of electricity, and there is an active over-the-counter market in forward contracts, options, and swaps. A typical contract (exchange-traded or over-the-counter) allows one side to receive a specified number of megawatt hours for a specified price at a specified location during a particular month. In a 
5*8 contract, power is received for 
five days a week (Monday to Friday) during the off-peak period (11 p.m. to 7 a.m.) for the specified month. In a 
5*16 contract, power is received five days a week during the 
on-peak period (7 a.m. to 11 p.m.) for the specified month. In a 7*24 contract, it is 
received around the clock every day during the month. Option contracts have either daily exercise or monthly exercise. In the case of daily exercise, the option holder can choose on each day of the month (by giving one day’s notice) whether to receive the specified amount of power at the specified strike price. When there is monthly exercise a  
1 Electricity producers with spare capacity sometimes use it to pump water to the top of their hydroelectric 
plants so that it can be used to produce electricity at a later time. This is the closest they can get to storing this 
commodity.
M35_HULL0654_11_GE_C35.indd   788 30/04/2021   17:53Energy and Commodity Derivatives 789
single decision on whether to receive power for the whole month at the specified strike 
price is made at the beginning of the month.
An interesting contract in electricity and natural gas markets is what is known as a 
swing option or take-and-pay option. In this contract, a minimum and maximum for the amount of power that must be purchased at a certain price by the option holder is specified for each day during a month and for the month in total. The option holder can change (or swing) the rate at which the power is purchased during the month, but usually there is a limit on the total number of changes that can be made.
To value derivatives, we are often interested in modeling the spot price of a commodity 
in the traditional risk-neutral world. From Section 18.6, the expected future price of the commodity in this world is the futures price.
A Simple Process
A simple process for a commodity price can be constructed by assuming that the expected growth rate in the commodity price is dependent solely on time and the volatility of the commodity price is constant. The risk-neutral process for the commodity price S then has the form
 
dS
S=m1t2 dt+s dz (35.1)
and
F1t2=En3S1t24=S102e#t
0m1t2dt
where F1t2 is the futures price for a contract with maturity t and En denotes expected 
value in a risk-neutral world. It follows that
ln F1t2=ln S102+3t
0m1t2dt
Differentiating both sides with respect to time gives
m1t2=0  
0  t3ln F1t24
Example 35.1
Suppose that the futures prices of live cattle at the end of July 2021 are (in cents 
per pound) as follows:
August 2021 62.20
October 2021 60.60
December 2021 62.70
February 2022 63.37
April 2022 64.42
June 2022 64.40
These can be used to estimate the expected growth rate in live cattle prices in a risk-neutral world. For example, when the model in equation (35.1) is used, the 35.4 MODELING COMMODITY PRICES
M35_HULL0654_11_GE_C35.indd   789 30/04/2021   17:53790 CHAPTER 35
expected growth rate in live cattle prices between October and December 2021, in 
a risk-neutral world is
lna62.70
60.60b=0.034
or 3.4% per 2 months with continuous compounding. On an annualized basis, this is 20.4% per annum.
Example 35.2
Suppose that the futures prices of live cattle are as in Example 35.1. A certain breeding decision would involve an investment of $100,000 now and expenditures of $20,000 in 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months. The result is expected to be that an extra cattle will be available for sale at the end of the year. There are two major uncertainties: the number of pounds of extra cattle that will be available for sale and the price per pound. The expected number of pounds is 300,000. The expected price of cattle in 1 year in a risk-neutral world is, from Example 35.1, 64.40 cents  
per pound. Assuming that the risk-free rate of interest is 10% per annum, the value of the investment (in thousands of dollars) is
-100-20e-0.1*0.25-20e-0.1*0.50-20e-0.1*0.75+300*0.644e-0.1*1=17.729
This assumes that any uncertainty about the extra amount of cattle that will be available for sale has zero systematic risk and that there is no correlation between the amount of cattle that will be available for sale and the price.
Mean Reversion
As already discussed, most commodity prices follow mean-reverting processes. They tend to get pulled back to a central value. A more realistic process than equation (35.1) for the risk-neutral process followed by the commodity price S is
 
d ln S=3u1t2-a ln S4 dt+s dz (35.2)
This incorporates mean reversion and is analogous to the lognormal process assumed for 
the short-term interest rate in Chapter 32. Note that this process is sometimes written
dS
S=3u*1t2-a ln S4 dt+s dz
From Itô’s lemma, this is equivalent to the process in equation (35.2) when u*1t2 = 
u1t2+1
2s2.
The trinomial tree methodology in Section 32.5 can be adapted to construct a tree  
for S and determine the value of u1t2 in equation (35.2) such that F1t2=En3S1t24. We will  
illustrate the procedure by building a three-step tree for the situation where the current spot price is $20 and the 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year futures prices are $22, $23, and $24, respectively. Suppose that 
a=0.1 and s=0.2 in equation (35.2). We first define a 
variable X that is initially zero and follows the process
 dX=-aX dt+s dz (35.3)
Using the procedure in Section 32.5, a trinomial tree can be constructed for X. This is 
shown in Figure 35.1.

Figure 35.1 Tree for X. Constructing this tree is the first stage in constructing a tree for 
the spot price of a commodity, S. Here pu, pm, and pd are the probabilities of “up”, 
“middle”, and “down” movements from a node.

The variable ln S follows the same process as X except for a time-dependent drift. 
Analogously to Section 32.5, the tree for X can be converted to a tree for ln S by  
displacing the positions of nodes. This tree is shown in Figure 35.2. The initial node  
corresponds to a price of 20, so the displacement for that node is ln 20. Suppose that the  
displacement of the nodes at 1 year is a1. The values of the X at the three nodes at the  
1-year point are +0.3464, 0, and -0.3464. The corresponding values of ln S are 
0.3464+a1, a1, and -0.3464+a1. The values of S are therefore e0.3464+a1, ea1, and 
e-0.3464+a1, respectively. We require the expected value of S to equal the futures price. 
This means that
0.1667e0.3464+a1+0.6666ea1+0.1667e-0.3464+a1=22
The solution to this is a1=3.071. The values of S at the 1-year point are therefore 
30.49, 21.56, and 15.25.
At the 2-year point, we first calculate the probabilities of nodes E, F, G, H, and I being 
reached from the probabilities of nodes B, C, and D being reached. The probability of 
reaching node F is the probability of reaching node B times the probability of moving  
from B to F plus the probability of reaching node C times the probability of moving from C to F. This is
0.1667*0.6566+0.6666*0.1667=0.2206
Similarly the probabilities of reaching nodes E, G, H, and I are 0.0203, 0.5183, 0.2206, and 0.0203, respectively. The amount 
a2 by which the nodes at time 2 years are  
M35_HULL0654_11_GE_C35.indd   791 30/04/2021   17:53792 CHAPTER 35
displaced must satisfy

+0.2206e-0.3464+a2+0.0203e-0.6928+a2=23
The solution to this is a2=3.099. This means that the values of S at the 2-year point 
are 44.35, 31.37, 22.18, 15.69, and 11.10, respectively.
A similar calculation can be carried out at time 3 years. Figure 35.2 shows the 
resulting tree for S.
Example 35.3
Suppose that the tree in Figure 35.2 is used to price a 3-year American put option 
on the spot price of the commodity with a strike price of 20 when the interest rate (continuously compounded) is 3% per year. Rolling back through the tree in the usual way, we obtain Figure 35.3 showing that the value of the option is $1.48. The option is exercised early at nodes D, H, and I. To obtain a more accurate value, a tree with many more time steps would be used. The futures prices would be interpolated to obtain futures prices for maturities corresponding to the end of every time step on this more detailed tree.
Interpolation and Seasonality
When a large number of time steps are used, it is necessary to interpolate between futures prices to obtain a futures price at the end of each time step. When there is seasonality, the interpolation procedure should reflect this. Suppose there are monthly

time steps. One simple way of incorporating seasonality is to collect monthly historical 
data on the spot price and calculate the 12-month moving average of the price.  
A percentage seasonal factor can then be estimated as the average of the ratio of the 
spot price for the month to the 12-month moving average of spot prices that is centered (approximately) on the month.
The percentage seasonal factors are then used to deseasonalize the futures prices 
that are known. Monthly deseasonalized futures are then calculated using interpola-tion. These futures prices are then seasonalized using the percentage seasonal factors and the tree is built. Suppose, for example, that the futures prices are observed in the  
market for September and December as 40 and 44, respectively, and we want to  
calculate a futures prices for October and November. Suppose further that the percentage seasonality factors for September, October, November, and December are calculated from historical data as 0.95, 0.85, 0.8 and 1.1, respectively. The deseasonalized futures prices are 
40>0.95=42.1 for September and 44>1.1=40 for  
December. The interpolated deseasonalized futures prices are 41.4 and 40.7 for  
October and November, respectively. The seasonalized futures prices that would be  
used in tree construction for October and November are 41.4*0.85=35.2 and 
40.7*0.8=32.6, respectively.
As has been mentioned, the volatility of a commodity sometimes shows seasonality. 
For example, the prices of some agricultural commodities are more volatile during the growing season because of weather uncertainty. Volatility can be monitored using the  
methods discussed in Chapter 23, and a percentage seasonal factor for volatility can  
be estimated. The parameter 
s can then be replaced by s1t2 in equations (35.2) 
and (35.3). A procedure that can be used to construct a trinomial tree for the situation Figure 35.3 Valuation of an American put option with a strike price of $20 using the 
tree in Figure 35.2.

Jumps
Some commodities, such as electricity and natural gas, exhibit price jumps because of weather-related demand shocks. Other commodities, particularly those that are agri-cultural, are liable to exhibit price jumps because of weather-related supply shocks. Jumps can be incorporated into equation (35.2) so that the process for the spot price becomes
d ln S=3u1t2-a ln S4 dt+s dz+dp
where dp is the Poisson process generating the percentage jumps. This is similar to 
Merton’s mixed jump–diffusion model for stock prices, which is described in Sec-tion 27.1. Once the jump frequency and jump size probability distribution have been 
chosen, the average increase in the commodity price at a future time t that is as a result of jumps can be calculated. To determine 
u1t2, the trinomial tree method can be used 
with the futures prices for maturity t reduced by this increase. Monte Carlo simulation can be used to implement the model, as explained in Sections 21.6 and 27.1.
Other Models
More-sophisticated models are sometimes used for oil prices. If y is the convenience yield, then the proportional drift of the spot price is 
r-y, where r is the short-term 
risk-free rate and a natural process to assume for the spot price is
dS
S=1r-y2 dt+s1 dz1
Gibson and Schwartz suggest that the convenience yield y be modeled as a mean- reverting process:
2
dy=k1a-y2dt+s2 dz2
where k and a are constants and dz2 is a Wiener process, which is correlated with the 
Wiener process dz1. To provide an exact fit to futures prices, a can be made a function 
of time.
Eydeland and Geman propose a stochastic volatility for gas and electricity prices.3 
This is
dS
S=a1b-ln S2 dt+2V dz1
dV=c1d-V2dt+e2V dz2
where a, b, c, d, and e are constants, and dz1 and dz2 are correlated Wiener processes. 
Later Geman proposed a model for oil where the reversion level b is also stochastic.4

5 The U.S. Department of Energy has estimated that one-seventh of the U.S. economy is subject to weather 
risk.Many companies are in the position where their performance is liable to be adversely 
affected by the weather.5 It makes sense for these companies to consider hedging their 
weather risk in much the same way as they hedge foreign exchange or interest rate risks.
The first over-the-counter weather derivatives were introduced in 1997. To under-
stand how they work, we explain two variables:
HDD: Heating degree days
CDD: Cooling degree days
A day’s HDD is defined as
HDD=max10, 65-A2
and a day’s CDD is defined as
CDD=max10, A-652
where A is the average of the highest and lowest temperature during the day at a 
specified weather station, measured in degrees Fahrenheit. For example, if the max-
imum temperature during a day (midnight to midnight) is 68° Fahrenheit and the 
minimum temperature is 44° Fahrenheit, A=56. The daily HDD is then 9 and the 
daily CDD is 0.
A typical over-the-counter product is a forward or option contract providing a payoff 
dependent on the cumulative HDD or CDD during a month. For example, a deriva-tives dealer could in January 2022 sell a client a call option on the cumulative HDD during February 2023 at the Chicago O’Hare Airport weather station with a strike price of 700 and a payment rate of $10,000 per degree day. If the actual cumulative HDD is 820, the payoff is $1.2 million. Often contracts include a payment cap. If the payment cap in our example is $1.5 million, the contract is the equivalent of a bull spread (see Chapter 12). The client has a long call option on cumulative HDD with a strike price of 700 and a short call option with a strike price of 850.
A day’s HDD is a measure of the volume of energy required for heating during the 
day. A day’s CDD is a measure of the volume of energy required for cooling during the day. Most weather derivative contracts are entered into by energy producers and energy consumers. But retailers, supermarket chains, food and drink manufacturers, health service companies, agriculture companies, and companies in the leisure industry are also potential users of weather derivatives. The Weather Risk Management Association (www.wrma.org) has been formed to serve the interests of the weather risk manage-ment industry.
In September 1999 the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) began trading weather 
futures and European options on weather futures. The contracts are on the cumulative HDD and CDD for a month observed at a weather station. The contracts are settled in cash just after the end of the month once the HDD and CDD are known. One futures contract is on $20 times the cumulative HDD or CDD for the month. The CME now offers weather futures and options for several cities throughout the world.35.5 WEATHER DERIVATIVES

6 The difference between a derivatives contract and an insurance contract is as follows. When entering into an 
insurance contract, an entity must have an exposure to the underlying risk. For a derivatives contract this is  
not necessary. For example, it is not possible for person A to insure person B’s house against being burnt 
down. But it is possible to buy a put option on a stock when it is not owned.
7 Reinsurance is also sometimes offered in the form of a lump sum if a certain loss level is reached. The 
reinsurer is then writing a cash-or-nothing binary call option on the losses.When derivative contracts are used for hedging purposes, they have many of the same 
characteristics as insurance contracts. Both types of contracts are designed to provide protection against adverse events. It is not surprising that many insurance companies have subsidiaries that trade derivatives and that many of the activities of insurance companies are becoming very similar to those of investment banks.
6
Traditionally the insurance industry has hedged its exposure to catastrophic (CAT) 
risks such as hurricanes and earthquakes using a practice known as reinsurance. Reinsurance contracts can take a number of forms. Suppose that an insurance company has an exposure of $100 million to earthquakes in California and wants to limit this to $30 million. One alternative is to enter into annual reinsurance contracts that cover on a pro rata basis 70% of its exposure. If California earthquake claims in a particular year total $50 million, the cost to the company would then be only $15 million. Another more popular alternative, involving lower reinsurance premiums, is to buy a series of reinsurance contracts covering what are known as excess cost layers. The first layer might provide indemnification for losses between $30 million and $40 million; the next might cover losses between $40 million and $50 million; and so on. Each reinsurance contract is known as an excess-of-loss reinsurance contract. The reinsurer has written a bull spread on the total losses. It is long a call option with a strike price equal to the lower end of the layer and short a call option with a strike price equal to the upper end of the layer.
7
Some payouts on CAT risks have been very high. Hurricane Andrew in 1992 caused 
about $15 billion of insurance costs in Florida. This exceeded the total of relevant insurance premiums received in Florida during the previous seven years. If Hurricane  
Andrew had hit Miami, it is estimated that insured losses would have exceeded $40 billion. Hurricane Andrew and other catastrophes have led to increases in insur-ance/reinsurance premiums.
The over-the-counter market has come up with a number of products that are 
alternatives to traditional reinsurance. The most popular is a CAT bond. This is a bond issued by a subsidiary of an insurance company that pays a higher-than-normal interest rate. In exchange for the extra interest the holder of the bond agrees to provide an excess-of-loss reinsurance contract. Depending on the terms of the CAT bond, the interest or principal (or both) can be used to meet claims. In the example considered above where an insurance company wants protection for California earthquake losses between $30 million and $40 million, the insurance company could issue CAT bonds  
with a total principal of $10 million. In the event that the insurance company’s California earthquake losses exceeded $30 million, bondholders would lose some or all of their principal. As an alternative the insurance company could cover this excess cost layer by making a much bigger bond issue where only the bondholders’ interest is at risk.35.6 INSURANCE DERIVATIVES
M35_HULL0654_11_GE_C35.indd   796 30/04/2021   17:53Energy and Commodity Derivatives 797
One distinctive feature of weather and insurance derivatives is that there is no systematic 
risk (i.e., risk that is priced by the market) in their payoffs. This means that estimates made from historical data (real-world estimates) can also be assumed to apply to the risk-neutral world. Weather and insurance derivatives can therefore be priced by
1. Using historical data to estimate the expected payoff
2. Discounting the estimated expected payoff at the risk-free rate.
Another key feature of weather and insurance derivatives is the way uncertainty about the underlying variables grows with time. For a stock price, uncertainty grows roughly as the square root of time. Our uncertainty about a stock price in 4 years (as measured by the standard deviation of the logarithm of the price) is approximately twice that in 1  
year. For a commodity price, mean reversion kicks in, but our uncertainty about a  
commodity’s price in 4 years is still considerably greater than our uncertainty in 1 year. For weather, the growth of uncertainty with time is much less marked. Our uncertainty about the February HDD at a certain location in 4 years is usually only a little greater  
than our uncertainty about the February HDD at the same location in 1 year.  
Similarly, our uncertainty about earthquake losses for a period starting in 4 years is usually only a little greater than our uncertainty about earthquake losses for a similar period starting in 1 year.
Consider the valuation of an option on the cumulative HDD. We could collect 
50 years of historical data and estimate a probability distribution for the HDD. This could be fitted to a lognormal or other probability distribution and the expected payoff on the option calculated. This would then be discounted at the risk-free rate to give the value of the option. The analysis could be refined by analyzing trends in the historical data and incorporating weather forecasts produced by meteorologists.
Example 35.4
Consider a call option on the cumulative HDD in February 2019 at the Chicago 
O’Hare Airport weather station with a strike price of 700 and a payment rate of $10,000 per degree day. Suppose that the HDD is estimated from 50 years of historical data to have a lognormal distribution with the mean HDD equal to  
710 and the standard deviation of the natural logarithm of HDD equal to 0.07. From equation (15A.1), the expected payoff is
10,000*3710N1d12-700N1d224
where
d1=ln1710>7002+0.072>2
0.07=0.2376
d2=ln1710>7002-0.072>2
0.07=0.1676
or $250,900. If the risk-free interest rate is 3% and the option is being valued in February 2018 (one year from maturity) the value of the option is
250,900*e-0.03*1=243,400
or $243,400.35.7 PRICING WEATHER AND INSURANCE DERIVATIVES
M35_HULL0654_11_GE_C35.indd   797 30/04/2021   17:53798 CHAPTER 35
We might want to adjust the mean of the probability distribution of HDD for 
temperature trends. Suppose that a linear regression shows that the cumulative 
HDD for February is decreasing at the rate of 0.5 per year (perhaps because of global warming), so that the estimate of the mean HDD in February 2019 is only 697.
8 Keeping the estimate of the standard deviation of the natural logarithm 
of the payoff the same, this would reduce the value of the expected payoff to $180,400 and the value of the option to $175,100.
Finally, suppose that long-range weather forecasters consider it likely that 
February 2019 will be particularly mild. The estimate of the expected HDD might then be reduced even further making the option even less valuable.
In the insurance area, Litzenberger et al. have shown that there is (as one would expect) no statistically significant correlation between the returns from CAT bonds and stock market returns.
9 This confirms that there is no systematic risk and that valuations can 
be based on the actuarial data collected by insurance companies.
CAT bonds typically give a high probability of an above-normal rate of interest and a 
low probability of a big loss. Why would investors be interested in such instruments? The answer is that the expected return (taking account of possible losses) is higher than the return that can be earned on risk-free investments. However, the risk in CAT bonds can (at least in theory) be completely diversified away in a large portfolio. CAT bonds therefore have the potential to improve risk–return trade-offs.
8 The mean decreased at 0.5 per year over the last 50 years and was 710 on average. This suggests that the 
mean was about 722.5 at the beginning of the 50 years and 697.5 at the end of the 50 years. A reasonable 
estimate for next year is 697.

Securities as a New Asset Class,” Journal of Portfolio Management, Winter 1996: 76–86.There are two components to the risks facing an energy producer. One is the risk 
associated with the market price for the energy (the price risk); the other is risk associated with the amount of energy that will be bought (the volume risk). Although prices do adjust to reflect volumes, there is a less-than-perfect relationship between the two, and energy producers have to take both into account when developing a hedging strategy. The price risk can be hedged using the energy derivative contracts. The volume risks can be hedged using the weather derivatives. Define:
Y : Profit for a month
P : Average energy prices for the month
T : Relevant temperature variable (HDD or CDD) for the month.
An energy producer can use historical data to obtain a best-fit linear regression relationship of the form
Y=a+bP+cT+P
where P is the error term. The energy producer can then hedge risks for the month by 
taking a position of -b in energy forwards or futures and a position of -c in weather 35.8 HOW AN ENERGY PRODUCER CAN HEDGE RISKS
M35_HULL0654_11_GE_C35.indd   798 30/04/2021   17:53Energy and Commodity Derivatives 799
forwards or futures. The relationship can also be used to analyze the effectiveness of 
alternative option strategies.
SUMMARY
When there are risks to be managed, derivatives markets have been very innovative in developing products to meet the needs of the market.
There are a number of different types of commodity derivatives. The underlyings 
include agricultural products that are grown, livestock, metals, and energy products. The models used to value them usually incorporate mean reversion. Sometimes seasonality is modeled explicitly and jumps are incorporated. Energy derivatives with oil, natural gas, and electricity as the underlying are particularly important and have been the subject of models that are as sophisticated as the most sophisticated models used for stock prices, exchange rates, and interest rates.
In the weather derivatives market, two measures, HDD and CDD, have been 
developed to describe temperature during a month. These are used to define payoffs on both exchange-traded and over-the-counter derivatives. As the weather derivatives market develops, contracts on rainfall, snow, and other weather-related variables may become more widely used.
Insurance derivatives are an alternative to traditional reinsurance as a way for 
insurance companies to manage the risk of a catastrophic event such as a hurricane or an earthquake. We may see other sorts of insurance, such as life and automobile insurance, being traded in a similar way in the future.
Weather and insurance derivatives have the property that the underlying variables have 
no systematic risk. This means that the derivatives can be valued by estimating expected payoffs using historical data and discounting the expected payoff at the risk-free rate.

36 CHAPTER  Real Options
Up to now we have been almost entirely concerned with the valuation of financial 
assets. In this chapter we explore how the ideas we have developed can be extended to  
assess capital investment opportunities in real assets such as land, buildings, plant, and  
equipment. Often there are options embedded in these investment opportunities (the  
option to expand the investment, the option to abandon the investment, the option to  
defer the investment, and so on.) These options are very difficult to value using  
traditional capital investment appraisal techniques. The approach known as real options attempts to deal with this problem using option pricing theory.
The chapter starts by explaining the traditional approach to evaluating investments in  
real assets and shows how difficult it is to correctly value embedded options when this  
approach is used. It then explains how the risk-neutral valuation approach can be extended to handle the valuation of real assets and presents a number of examples illustrating the application of the approach in different situations.
The traditional approach to valuing a potential capital investment project is the “net 
present value” (NPV) approach. The NPV of a project is the present value of its  
expected future incremental cash flows. The discount rate used to calculate the present value is a “risk-adjusted” discount rate, chosen to reflect the risk of the project. As the riskiness of the project increases, the discount rate also increases.
As an example, consider an investment that costs $100 million and will last 5 years. 
The expected cash inflow in each year (in the real world) is estimated to be $25 million. If the risk-adjusted discount rate is 12% (with continuous compounding), the net present value of the investment is (in millions of dollars)
-100+25e-0.12*1+25e-0.12*2+25e-0.12*3+25e-0.12*4+25e-0.12*5=-11.53
A negative NPV , such as the one we have just calculated, indicates that the project will reduce the value of the company to its shareholders and should not be undertaken. A positive NPV would indicate that the project should be undertaken because it will increase shareholder wealth.36.1 CAPITAL INVESTMENT APPRAISAL
M36_HULL0654_11_GE_C36.indd   802 30/04/2021   17:54Real Options 803
The risk-adjusted discount rate should be the return required by the company, or the 
company’s shareholders, on the investment. This can be calculated in a number of ways. 
One approach often recommended involves the capital asset pricing model (see the appendix to Chapter 3). The steps are as follows:
1. Take a sample of companies whose main line of business is the same as that of the project being contemplated.
2. Calculate the betas of the companies and average them to obtain a proxy beta for 
the project.
3. Set the required rate of return equal to the risk-free rate plus the proxy beta times 
the excess return of the market portfolio over the risk-free rate.
One problem with the traditional NPV approach is that many projects contain embedded options. Consider, for example, a company that is considering building a plant to manufacture a new product. Often the company has the option to abandon the project if things do not work out well. It may also have the option to expand the plant if demand for the output exceeds expectations. These options usually have quite different risk characteristics from the base project and require different discount rates.
To understand the problem here, return to the example at the beginning of Chapter 13. 
This involved a stock whose current price is $20. In three months the price will be either $22 or $18. Risk-neutral valuation shows that the value of a three-month call option on the stock with a strike price of 21 is 0.545. Footnote 1 of Chapter 13 shows that if the expected return required by investors on the stock in the real world is 10% then the expected return required on the call option is 55.96%. A similar analysis shows that if the option is a put rather than a call the expected return required on the option is 
-70.4%.  
These analyses mean that if the traditional NPV approach were used to value the call option the correct discount rate would be 55.96%, and if it were used to value a put option the correct discount rate would be 
-70.4%. There is no easy way of estimating 
these discount rates. (We know them only because we are able to value the options another way.) Similarly, there is no easy way of estimating the risk-adjusted discount rates appropriate for cash flows when they arise from abandonment, expansion, and other options. This is the motivation for exploring whether the risk-neutral valuation principle can be applied to options on real assets as well as to options on financial assets.
Another problem with the traditional NPV approach lies in the estimation of the 
appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate for the base project (i.e., the project without embedded options). The companies that are used to estimate a proxy beta for the project in the three-step procedure above have expansion options and abandonment options of their own. Their betas reflect these options and may not therefore be appropriate for estimating a beta for the base project.
In Section 28.1 the market price of risk for a variable 
u was defined as
 l=m-r
s (36.1)
where r is the risk-free rate, m is the return on a traded security dependent only on u,  36.2 EXTENSION OF THE RISK-NEUTRAL VALUATION FRAMEWORK
M36_HULL0654_11_GE_C36.indd   803 30/04/2021   17:54804 CHAPTER 36
and s is its volatility. As shown in Section 28.1, the market price of risk, l, does not 
depend on the particular traded security chosen.
Suppose that a real asset depends on several variables ui 1i=1, 2, c 2. Let mi and si  
be the expected growth rate and volatility of ui so that
dui>ui=mi dt+si dzi
where zi is a Wiener process. Define li as the market price of risk of ui. Risk-neutral 
valuation can be extended to show that any asset dependent on the ui can be valued by1
1. Reducing the expected growth rate of each ui from mi to mi-lisi
2. Discounting cash flows at the risk-free rate.
Example 36.1
The cost of renting commercial real estate in a certain city is quoted as the 
amount that would be paid per square foot per year in a new 5-year rental agreement. The current cost is $30 per square foot. The expected growth rate of the cost is 12% per annum, the volatility of the cost is 20% per annum, and its market price of risk is 0.3. A company has the opportunity to pay $1 million now for the option to rent 100,000 square feet at $35 per square foot for a 5-year  
period starting in 2 years. The risk-free rate is 5% per annum (assumed constant). Define V as the quoted cost per square foot of office space in 2 years. Assume that 
rent is paid annually in advance. The payoff from the option is
100,000A max1V-35, 02
where A is an annuity factor given by
A=1+1*e-0.05*1+1*e-0.05*2+1*e-0.05*3+1*e-0.05*4=4.5355
The expected payoff in a risk-neutral world is therefore
100,000*4.5355*En3max1V-35, 024=453,550*En3max1V-35, 024
where En denotes expectations in a risk-neutral world. Using the result in equa-
tion (15A. 1), this is
453,5503En1V2N1d12-35N1d224
where
d1=ln3En1V2>354+0.22*2>2
0.222 and d2=ln3En1V2>354-0.22*2>2
0.222
The expected growth rate in the cost of commercial real estate in a risk-neutral world is 
m-ls, where m is the real-world growth rate, s is the volatility, and l is  
the market price of risk. In this case, m=0.12, s=0.2, and l=0.3, so that the  
expected risk-neutral growth rate is 0.06, or 6%, per year. It follows that 
En1V2=30e0.06*2=33.82. Substituting this in the expression above gives the 
expected payoff in a risk-neutral world as $1.5015 million. Discounting at the  
1 To see that this is consistent with risk-neutral valuation for an investment asset, suppose that ui is the price 
of a non-dividend-paying stock. Since this is the price of a traded security, equation (36.1) implies that 
1mi-r2>si=li, or mi-lisi=r. The expected growth-rate adjustment is therefore the same as setting the 
return on the stock equal to the risk-free rate. For a proof of the more general result, see Technical Note 20 
at: www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull/TechnicalNotes.
M36_HULL0654_11_GE_C36.indd   804 30/04/2021   17:54Real Options 805
risk-free rate the value of the option is 1.5015e-0.05*2=$1.3586 million. This 
shows that it is worth paying $1 million for the option.
The real-options approach to evaluating an investment avoids the need to estimate risk- 
adjusted discount rates in the way described in Section 36.1, but it does require market 
price of risk parameters for all stochastic variables. When historical data are available for a particular variable, its market price of risk can be estimated using the capital asset pricing model. To show how this is done, we consider an investment asset dependent solely on the variable and define:
m : Expected return of the investment asset
s : Volatility of the return of the investment asset
l : Market price of risk of the variable
r :  Instantaneous correlation between the percentage changes in the variable and 
returns on a broad index of stock market prices
mm : Expected return on broad index of stock market prices
sm : Volatility of return on the broad index of stock market prices
r : Short-term risk-free rate
Because the investment asset is dependent solely on the market variable, the instant-
aneous correlation between its return and the broad index of stock market prices is also 
r. From a continuous-time version of the capital asset pricing model, which is 
presented in the appendix to Chapter 3,2
m-r=rs
sm1mm-r2
From equation (36.1), another expression for m-r is
m-r=ls
It follows that
 l=r
sm1mm-r2 (36.2)
This equation can be used to estimate l.
Example 36.2
A historical analysis of company’s sales, quarter by quarter, show that percentage 
changes in sales have a correlation of 0.3 with returns on the S&P 500 index. The volatility of the S&P 500 is 20% per annum and based on historical data the expected excess return of the S&P 500 over the risk-free rate is 5%. Equation (36.2) estimates the market price of risk for the company’s sales as
0.3
0.2*0.05=0.07536.3 ESTIMATING THE MARKET PRICE OF RISK
2 When the excess return on the asset is regressed against the excess on the market index, the slope of the 
regression, beta, is rs>sm.
M36_HULL0654_11_GE_C36.indd   805 30/04/2021   17:54806 CHAPTER 36
When no historical data are available for the particular variable under consideration, 
other similar variables can sometimes be used as proxies. For example, if a plant is being constructed to manufacture a new product, data can be collected on the sales of other similar products. The correlation of the new product’s price with the market index can then be assumed to be the same as that of these other products. In some cases, the estimate of 
r in equation (36.2) must be based on subjective judgment. If an analyst is 
convinced that a particular variable is unrelated to the performance of a market index, its market price of risk should be set to zero.
For some variables, it is not necessary to estimate the market price of risk because 
the process followed by a variable in a risk-neutral world can be estimated directly. For example, if the variable is the price of an investment asset, its total return in a risk- neutral world is the risk-free rate. If the variable is the short-term interest rate r, 
Chapter 31 shows how a risk-neutral process can be estimated from the initial term structure of interest rates.
For commodities, futures prices can be used to estimate the risk-neutral process, as 
discussed in Chapter 35. Example 35.2 provides a simple application of the real options approach by using futures prices to evaluate an investment involving the breeding of cattle.
Traditional methods of business valuation, such as applying a price/earnings multiplier 
to current earnings, do not work well for new businesses. Typically a company’s earnings are negative during its early years as it attempts to gain market share and establish relationships with customers. The company must be valued by estimating future earnings and cash flows under different scenarios.
The real options approach can be useful in this situation. A model relating the 
company’s future cash flows to variables such as the sales growth rates, variable costs as a percent of sales, fixed costs, and so on, is developed. For key variables, a risk-neutral stochastic process is estimated as outlined in the previous two sections. A Monte Carlo simulation is then carried out to generate alternative scenarios for the net cash flows per year in a risk-neutral world. It is likely that under some of these scenarios the company does very well and under others it becomes bankrupt and ceases operations. (The simulation must have a built in rule for determining when bankruptcy happens.) The value of the company is the present value of the expected cash flow in each year using the risk-free rate for discounting. Business Snapshot 36.1 gives an example of the application of the approach to Amazon.com in its early days.36.4 APPLICATION TO THE VALUATION OF A BUSINESS
As already mentioned, most investment projects involve options. These options can add  
considerable value to the project and are often either ignored or valued incorrectly. Examples of the options embedded in projects are:
1. Abandonment options. This is an option to sell or close down a project. It is an American put option on the project’s value. The strike price of the option is the 36.5 EVALUATING OPTIONS IN AN INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY
M36_HULL0654_11_GE_C36.indd   806 30/04/2021   17:54Real Options 807
liquidation (or resale) value of the project less any closing-down costs. When the 
liquidation value is low, the strike price can be negative. Abandonment options mitigate the impact of very poor investment outcomes and increase the initial valuation of a project.
2. Expansion options. This is the option to make further investments and increase the  
output if conditions are favorable. It is an American call option on the value of 
additional capacity. The strike price of the call option is the cost of creating this additional capacity discounted to the time of option exercise. The strike price often depends on the initial investment. If management initially choose to build capacity in excess of the expected level of output, the strike price can be relatively small.Business Snapshot 36.1 Valuing Amazon.com
One of the earliest published attempts to value a company using the real options 
approach was Schwartz and Moon (2000), who considered Amazon.com at the end of 1999. They assumed the following stochastic processes for the company’s sales revenue R and its revenue growth rate 
m:
dR
R=m dt+s1t2 dz1
dm=k1m-m2 dt+h1t2 dz2
They assumed that the two Wiener processes dz1 and dz2 were uncorrelated and made 
reasonable assumptions about s1t2, h1t2, k, and m based on available data.
They assumed the cost of goods sold would be 75% of sales, other variable 
expenses would be 19% of sales, and fixed expenses would be $75 million per quarter. The initial sales level was $356 million, the initial tax loss carry forward was $559 million, and the tax rate was assumed to be 35%. The market price of risk for R was estimated from historical data using the approach described in the previous 
section. The market price of risk for 
m was assumed to be zero.
The time horizon for the analysis was 25 years and the terminal value of the 
company was assumed to be ten times pretax operating profit. The initial cash position was $906 million and the company was assumed to go bankrupt if the cash balance became negative.
Different future scenarios were generated in a risk-neutral world using Monte  
Carlo simulation. The evaluation of the scenarios involved taking account of the possible exercise of convertible bonds and the possible exercise of employee stock options. The value of the company to the share holders was calculated as the present value of the net cash flows discounted at the risk-free rate.
Using these assumptions, Schwartz and Moon provided an estimate of the value 
of Amazon. com’s shares at the end of 1999 equal to $12.42. The market price at the time was $76.125 (although it declined sharply in 2000). One of the key advantages of the real-options approach is that it identifies the key assumptions. Schwartz and Moon found that the estimated share value was very sensitive to 
h1t2, the volatility of  
the growth rate. This was an important source of optionality. A small increase  
in h1t2 leads to more optionality and a big increase in the value of Amazon.com 
shares. No doubt Amazon has benefited from this optionality.
M36_HULL0654_11_GE_C36.indd   807 30/04/2021   17:54808 CHAPTER 36
3. Contraction options. This is the option to reduce the scale of a project’s operation. 
It is an American put option on the value of the lost capacity. The strike price is the present value of the future expenditures saved as seen at the time of exercise of the option.
4. Options to defer. One of the most important options open to a manager is the option to defer a project. This is an American call option on the value of the project.
5. Options to extend life. Sometimes it is possible to extend the life of an asset by 
paying a fixed amount. This is a European call option on the asset’s future value.
Illustration
As an example of the evaluation of an investment with embedded options, consider a company that has to decide whether to invest $15 million to extract 6 million units of a commodity from a certain source at the rate of 2 million units per year for 3 years. The fixed costs of operating the equipment are $6 million per year and the variable costs are $17 per unit of the commodity extracted. We assume that the risk-free interest rate is 10% per annum for all maturities, that the spot price of the commodity is $20, and that the 1 -, 2-, and 3-year futures prices are $22, $23, and $24, respectively.
Evaluation with No Embedded Options
First consider the case where the project has no embedded options. The expected prices of the commodity in 1, 2, and 3 years’ time in a risk-neutral world are $22, $23, and $24, respectively. The expected payoff from the project (in millions of dollars) in a risk-neutral  
world can be calculated from the cost data as 4.0, 6.0, and 8.0 in years 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The value of the project is therefore
-15.0+4.0e-0.1*1+6.0e-0.1*2+8.0e-0.1*3=-0.54
This analysis indicates that the project should not be undertaken because it would reduce shareholder wealth by 0.54 million.
Use of a Tree
We now assume that the spot price of the commodity follows the process
 d ln S=3u1t2-a ln S4 dt+s dz (36.3)
where a=0.1 and s=0.2. In Section 35.4, we showed how a tree can be constructed 
for commodity prices using the same example as the one considered here. The tree is 
shown in Figure 36.1 (which is the same as Figure 35.2). The process represented by the 
tree is consistent with the process assumed for S, the assumed values of a and s, and the 
assumed 1 -, 2-, and 3-year futures prices.
We do not need to use a tree to value the project when there are no embedded 
options. (We have already shown that the base value of the project without options is 
-0.54.) However, before we move on to consider options, it will be instructive, as well 
as useful for future calculations, for us to use the tree to value the project in the absence of embedded options and verify that we get the same answer as that obtained earlier.

Figure 36.2 shows the value of the project at each node of Figure 36.1. Consider, for 
example, node H. There is a 0.2217 probability that the commodity price at the end of 
the third year is 22.85, so that the third-year profit is 2*22.85-2*17-6=5.70. 
Similarly, there is a 0.6566 probability that the commodity price at the end of the third year is 16.16, so that the profit is 
-7.68 and there is a 0.1217 probability that the 
commodity price at the end of the third year is 11.43, so that the profit is -17.14. The 
value of the project at node H in Figure 36.2 is therefore
30.2217*5.70+0.6566*1-7.682+0.1217*1-17.1424e-0.1*1=-5.31
As another example, consider node C. There is a 0.1667 chance of moving to node F where the commodity price is 31.37. The second year cash flow is then
2*31.37-2*17-6=22.74
The value of subsequent cash flows at node F is 21.42. The total value of the project if we move to node F is therefore 
21.42+22.74=44.16. Similarly the total value of the 
project if we move to nodes G and H are 10.35 and -13.93, respectively. The value of 
the project at node C is therefore
30.1667*44.16+0.6666*10.35+0.1667*1-13.9324e-0.1*1=10.80
Figure 36.2 shows that the value of the project at the initial node A is 14.46. When the 
initial investment is taken into account the value of the project is therefore -0.54. This 
is in agreement with our earlier calculations.

Option to Abandon
Suppose now that the company has the option to abandon the project at any time. We 
suppose that there is no salvage value and no further payments are required once the project has been abandoned. Abandonment is an American put option with a strike price of zero and is valued in Figure 36.3. The put option should not be exercised at nodes E, F, and G because the value of the project is positive at these nodes. It should be exercised at nodes H and I. The value of the put option is 5.31 and 13.49 at nodes H and I, respectively. Rolling back through the tree, the value of the abandonment put option at node D if it is not exercised is
10.1217*13.49+0.6566*5.31+0.2217*02e-0.1*1=4.64
The value of exercising the put option at node D is 9.65. This is greater than 4.64, and so the put should be exercised at node D. The value of the put option at node C is
30.1667*0+0.6666*0+0.1667*5.314e-0.1*1=0.80
and the value at node A is
10.1667*0+0.6666*0.80+0.1667*9.652e-0.1*1=1.94
The abandonment option is therefore worth $1.94 million. It increases the value of the project from 
-$0.54 million to +$1.40 million. A project that was previously unattractive 
now has a positive value to shareholders.

Option to Expand
Suppose next that the company has no abandonment option. Instead it has the option at  
any time to increase the scale of the project by 20%. The cost of doing this is $2 million. 
Production increases from 2.0 to 2.4 million units per year. Variable costs remain $17 per  
unit and fixed costs increase by 20% from $6.0 million to $7.2 million. This is an American call option to buy 20% of the base project in Figure 36.2 for $2 million. The option is valued in Figure 36.4. At node E, the option should be exercised. The 
payoff is 
0.2*42.24-2=6.45. At node F, it should also be exercised for a payoff of 
0.2*21.42-2=2.28. At nodes G, H, and I, the option should not be exercised. At  
node B, exercising is worth more than waiting and the option is worth 0.2*38.32-2 = 
5.66. At node C, if the option is not exercised, it is worth
10.1667*2.28+0.6666*0.00+0.1667*0.002e-0.1*1=0.34
If the option is exercised, it is worth 0.2*10.80-2=0.16. The option should there-
fore not be exercised at node C. At node A, if not exercised, the option is worth
10.1667*5.66+0.6666*0.34+0.1667*0.002e-0.1*1=1.06
If the option is exercised it is worth 0.2*14.46-2=0.89. Early exercise is therefore 
not optimal at node A. In this case, the option increases the value of the project from 
-0.54 to +0.52. Again we find that a project that previously had a negative value now 
has a positive value.

The expansion option in Figure 36.4 is relatively easy to value because, once the 
option has been exercised, all subsequent cash inflows and outflows increase by 20%. In 
the case where fixed costs remain the same or increase by less than 20%, it is necessary to keep track of more information at the nodes of Figure 36.4. Specifically, we need to record the following in order to calculate the payoff from exercising the option:
1. The present value of subsequent fixed costs
2. The present value of subsequent revenues net of variable costs.
Multiple Options
When a project has two or more options, they are typically not independent. The value of  
having both option A and option B, for example, is generally not the sum of the values of the two options. To illustrate this, suppose that the company we have been considering has both abandonment and expansion options. The project cannot be expanded if it has already been abandoned. Moreover, the value of the put option to abandon depends on whether the project has been expanded.
3
These interactions between the options in our example can be handled by defining 
four states at each node:
1. Not already abandoned; not already expanded
2. Not already abandoned; already expanded
3 As it happens, the two options do not interact in Figures 36.3 and 36.4. However, the interactions between 
the options would become an issue if a larger tree with smaller time steps were built.
M36_HULL0654_11_GE_C36.indd   812 30/04/2021   17:54Real Options 813
3. Already abandoned; not already expanded
4. Already abandoned; already expanded.
When we roll back through the tree we calculate the combined value of the options at 
each node for all four alternatives. This approach to valuing path-dependent options is discussed in more detail in Section 27. 5.
Several Stochastic Variables
When there are several stochastic variables, the value of the base project is usually determined by Monte Carlo simulation. The valuation of the project’s embedded options is then more difficult because a Monte Carlo simulation works from the beginning to the end of a project. When we reach a certain point, we do not have information on the present value of the project’s future cash flows. However, the techniques mentioned in Section 27. 8 for valuing American options using Monte Carlo 
simulation can sometimes be used.
As an illustration of this point, Schwartz and Moon (2000) explain how their 
Amazon.com analysis outlined in Business Snapshot 36.1 could be extended to take 
account of the option to abandon (i.e. the option to declare bankruptcy) when the value  
of future cash flows is negative.
4 At each time step, a polynomial relationship between the  
value of not abandoning and variables such as the current revenue, revenue growth rate, volatilities, cash balances, and loss carry forwards is assumed. Each simulation trial  
provides an observation for obtaining a least-squares estimate of the relationship at each  
time. This is the Longstaff and Schwartz approach of Section 27. 8.

SUMMARY
This chapter has investigated how the ideas developed earlier in the book can be applied to the valuation of real assets and options on real assets. It has shown how  
the risk-neutral valuation principle can be used to value a project dependent on any set of variables. The expected growth rate of each variable is adjusted to reflect its market price of risk. The value of the asset is then the present value of its expected cash flows discounted at the risk-free rate.
Risk-neutral valuation provides an internally consistent approach to capital invest-
ment appraisal. It also makes it possible to value the options that are embedded in many of the projects that are encountered in practice. This chapter has illustrated the approach by applying it to the valuation of Amazon.com at the end of 1999 and the valuation of a project involving the extraction of a commodity.

Practice Questions
 36.1. Explain the difference between the net present value approach and the risk-neutral  
valuation approach for valuing a new capital investment opportunity. What are the 
advantages of the risk-neutral valuation approach for valuing real options?
 36.2.  The market price of risk for copper is 0.5, the volatility of copper prices is 20% per annum, the spot price is 80 cents per pound, and the 6-month futures price is 75 cents per  
pound. What is the expected percentage growth rate in copper prices over the next 6 months?
 36.3.  Show that if y is a commodity’s convenience yield and u is its storage cost, the 
commodity’s growth rate in the traditional risk-neutral world is 
r-y+u, where r is  
the risk-free rate. Deduce the relationship between the market price of risk of the  
commodity, its real-world growth rate, its volatility, y, and u.
 36.4.  The correlation between a company’s gross revenue and the market index is 0.2. The excess return of the market over the risk-free rate is 6% and the volatility of the market index is 18%. What is the market price of risk for the company’s revenue?
 36.5.  A company can buy an option for the delivery of 1 million units of a commodity in 3 years at $25 per unit. The 3-year futures price is $24. The risk-free interest rate is 5% per annum with continuous compounding and the volatility of the futures price is 20% per annum. How much is the option worth?
 36.6.  A driver entering into a car lease agreement can obtain the right to buy the car in 4 years for $10,000. The current value of the car is $30,000. The value of the car, S, is expected to 
follow the process 
dS=mS dt+sS dz, where m=-0.25, s=0.15, and dz is a Wiener 
process. The market price of risk for the car price is estimated to be -0.1. What is the 
value of the option? Assume that the risk-free rate for all maturities is 6%.
 36.7. Suppose that the spot price, 6-month futures price, and 12-month futures price for wheat are 250, 260, and 270 cents per bushel, respectively. Suppose that the price of wheat follows the process in equation (36.3) with 
a=0.05 and s=0.15. Construct a two-time-
step tree for the price of wheat in a risk-neutral world.
A farmer has a project that involves an expenditure of $10,000 and a further 
expenditure of $90,000 in 6 months. It will increase wheat that is harvested and sold by 40,000 bushels in 1 year. What is the value of the project? Suppose that the farmer can abandon the project in 6 months and avoid paying the $90,000 cost at that time. What is the value of the abandonment option? Assume a risk-free rate of 5% with continuous compounding.

Derivatives 
Mishaps and What 
We Can Learn 
from Them
Since the mid-1980s there have been some spectacular losses in derivatives markets. The 
biggest losses have come from the trading of products created from subprime residential mortgages in the United States and were discussed in Chapter 8. Some of the other losses made by financial institutions are listed in Business Snapshot 37.1, and some of 
those made by nonfinancial organizations in Business Snapshot 37. 2. What is remark-
able about these lists is the number of situations where huge losses arose from the activities of a single employee. In 1995, Nick Leeson’s trading brought a 200-year-old British bank, Barings, to its knees; in 1994, Robert Citron’s trading led to Orange County, a municipality in California, losing about $2 billion. Joseph Jett’s trading for Kidder Peabody lost $350 million. John Rusnak’s losses of $700 million for Allied Irish Bank came to light in 2002. In 2006 the hedge fund Amaranth lost $6 billion because of trading risks taken by Brian Hunter. In 2008, Jérôme Kerviel lost over $7 billion trading equity index futures for Société Générale. The huge losses at UBS, Shell, and Sumitomo were also each the result of the activities of a single individual.
The losses should not be viewed as an indictment of the whole derivatives industry. 
The derivatives market is a vast multitrillion dollar market that by most measures has been outstandingly successful and has served the needs of its users well. The events listed in Business Snapshots 37. 1 and 37. 2 represent a tiny proportion of the total trades 
(both in number and value). Nevertheless, it is worth considering carefully the lessons that can be learned from them.37 CHAPTER

Business Snapshot 37.1 Big Losses by Financial Institutions
Allied Irish Bank
This bank lost about $700 million from speculative activities of one of its foreign 
exchange traders, John Rusnak, that lasted a number of years. Rusnak managed to cover up his losses by creating fictitious option trades.
Amaranth
This hedge fund lost $6 billion in 2006 betting on the future direction of natural gas 
prices.
Barings
This 200-year-old British bank was destroyed in 1995 by the activities of one trader, 
Nick Leeson, in Singapore, who made big bets on the future direction of the Nikkei 225 using futures and options. The total loss was close to $1 billion.
Enron’s counterparties
Enron managed to conceal its true situation from its shareholders with some creative 
contracts. Several financial institutions that allegedly helped Enron do this have settled shareholder lawsuits for over $1 billion.
Kidder Peabody (see Business Snapshot 5.1)
The activities of a single trader, Joseph Jett, led to this New York investment dealer 
losing $350 million trading U.S. government securities. The loss arose because of a mistake in the way the company’s computer system calculated profits.
Long-Term Capital Management (see Business Snapshot 2.2)
This hedge fund lost about $4 billion in 1998 as a result of Russia’s default on its debt  
and the resultant flight to quality. The New York Federal Reserve organized an 
orderly liquidation of the fund by arranging for 14 banks to invest in the fund.
Midland Bank
This British bank lost $500 million in the early 1990s largely because of a wrong bet  
on the direction of interest rates. It was later taken over by the Hong Kong and 
Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC).
Société Générale (see Business Snapshot 1.4)
Jérôme Kerviel lost over $7 billion speculating on the future direction of equity 
indices in January 2008.
Subprime Mortgage Losses (see Chapter 8)
In 2007 investors lost confidence in the structured products created from U.S. 
subprime mortgages. This led to a “credit crunch” and losses of tens of billions of dollars by financial institutions such as UBS, Merrill Lynch, and Citigroup.
UBS
In 2011, Kweku Adoboli lost $2.3 billion by taking unauthorized speculative positions 
in stock market indices.

Define Risk Limits
It is essential that all companies define in a clear and unambiguous way limits to the 
financial risks that can be taken. They should then set up procedures for ensuring that  
the limits are obeyed. Ideally, overall risk limits should be set at board level. These should then be converted to limits applicable to the individuals responsible for  
managing particular risks. Daily reports should indicate the gain or loss that will be experienced for particular movements in market variables. These should be checked against the actual gains and losses that are experienced to ensure that the valuation procedures underlying the reports are accurate.
It is particularly important that companies monitor risks carefully when derivatives 
are used. This is because, as we saw in Chapter 1, derivatives can be used for hedging, Business Snapshot 37.2 Big Losses by Nonfinancial Organizations
Allied LyonsThe treasury department of this drinks and food company lost $150 million in 1991 selling call options on the U.S. dollar–sterling exchange rate.
Gibson Greetings
The treasury department of this greeting card manufacturer lost about $20 million in  
1994 trading highly exotic interest rate derivatives contracts with Bankers Trust. It later sued Bankers Trust and settled out of court.
Hammersmith and Fulham (see Business Snapshot 7.2)
This British Local Authority lost about $600 million on sterling interest rate swaps and options in 1988. All its contracts were later declared null and void by the British courts, much to the annoyance of the banks on the other side of the transactions.
Metallgesellschaft (see Business Snapshot 3.2)
This German company entered into long-term contracts to supply oil and gasoline and hedged them by rolling over short-term futures contracts. It lost $1.3 billion when it was forced to discontinue this activity.
Orange County (see Business Snapshot 4.1)
The activities of the treasurer, Robert Citron, led to this California municipality losing about $2 billion in 1994. The treasurer was using derivatives to speculate that interest rates would not rise.
Procter & Gamble (see Business Snapshot 34.4)
The treasury department of this large U.S. company lost about $90 million in 1994 trading highly exotic interest rate derivatives contracts with Bankers Trust. It later sued Bankers Trust and settled out of court.
Shell
A single employee working in the Japanese subsidiary of this company lost $1 billion dollars in unauthorized trading of currency futures.
Sumitomo
A single trader working for this Japanese company lost about $2 billion in the copper spot, futures, and options market in the 1990s.
M37_HULL0654_11_GE_C37.indd   817 30/04/2021   17:55818 CHAPTER 37
speculation, and arbitrage. Without close monitoring, it is impossible to know whether 
a derivatives trader has switched from being a hedger to a speculator or switched from being an arbitrageur to being a speculator. The Barings, Société Générale, and UBS losses are classic examples of what can go wrong. In each case, the trader’s mandate was to carry out low-risk arbitrage or hedging. Unknown to their supervisors, the traders switched from being arbitrageurs or hedgers to taking huge bets on the future direction of market variables. Systems at their banks were so inadequate that nobody knew the full extent of what they were doing.
The argument here is not that no risks should be taken. A trader in a financial 
institution or a fund manager should be allowed to take positions on the future direction of relevant market variables. But the sizes of the positions that can be taken should be limited and the systems in place should accurately report the risks being taken.
Take the Risk Limits Seriously
What happens if an individual exceeds risk limits and makes a profit? This is a tricky issue for senior management. It is tempting to ignore violations of risk limits when profits result. However, this is shortsighted. It leads to a culture where risk limits are not taken seriously, and it paves the way for a disaster. In some of the situations listed in Business Snapshots 37. 1 and 37. 2, the companies had become complacent about 
the risks they were taking because they had taken similar risks in previous years and made profits.
A classic example here is Orange County. Robert Citron’s activities in 1991 –93 had 
been very profitable for Orange County, and the municipality had come to rely on his trading for additional funding. People chose to ignore the risks he was taking because he had produced profits. Unfortunately, the losses made in 1994 far exceeded the profits from previous years.
The penalties for exceeding risk limits should be just as great when profits result as 
when losses result. Otherwise, traders who make losses are liable to find a way of temporarily hiding their losses so that they can increase their bets in the hope that eventually a profit will result and all will be forgiven.
Do Not Assume You Can Outguess the Market
Some traders are quite possibly better than others. But no trader gets it right all the time. A trader who correctly predicts the direction in which market variables will move 60% of the time is doing well. If a trader has an outstanding track record (as Robert Citron did in the early 1990s), it is likely to be a result of luck rather than superior trading skill.
Suppose that a financial institution employs 16 traders and one of those traders 
makes profits in every quarter of a year. Should the trader receive a good bonus?  
Should the trader’s risk limits be increased? The answer to the first question is that inevitably the trader will receive a good bonus. The answer to the second question  
should be no. The chance of making a profit in four consecutive quarters from random trading is 
0.54 or 1 in 16. This means that just by chance one of the  
16 traders will “get it right” every single quarter of the year. It should not be  
assumed that the trader’s luck will continue and the trader’s risk limits should not  
be increased.
M37_HULL0654_11_GE_C37.indd   818 30/04/2021   17:55Derivatives Mishaps and What We Can Learn from Them 819
Do Not Underestimate the Benefits of Diversification
When a trader appears good at predicting a particular market variable, there is a 
tendency to increase the trader’s limits. We have just argued that this is a bad idea because it is quite likely that the trader has been lucky rather than clever. However, let  
us suppose that a fund is really convinced that the trader has special talents. How  
undiversified should it allow itself to become in order to take advantage of the trader’s special skills? The answer is that the benefits from diversification are huge, and it may not be the best strategy to forego these benefits to speculate heavily on just one market variable.
An example will illustrate the point here. Suppose that there are 20 stocks, each of 
which have an expected return of 10% per annum and a standard deviation of returns of 30%. The correlation between the returns from any two of the stocks is 0.2. By  
dividing an investment equally among the 20 stocks, an investor has an expected return of 10% per annum and standard deviation of returns of 14.7%. Diversification enables the investor to reduce risks by over half. Another way of expressing this is that diversification enables an investor to double the expected return per unit of risk taken. The investor would have to be very good at stock picking to consistently get a better risk–  
return trade-off by investing in just one stock.
Carry out Scenario Analyses and Stress Tests
The calculation of risk measures such as value at risk and expected shortfall should always be accompanied by scenario analyses and stress testing to obtain an under -
standing of what can go wrong. They are very important. Human beings have an unfortunate tendency to anchor on one or two scenarios when evaluating decisions. In 1993 and 1994, for example, Procter & Gamble and Gibson Greetings may have been so  
convinced that interest rates would remain low that they ignored the possibility of a 100-basis-point increase in their decision making.
It is important to be creative in the way scenarios are generated and to use the 
judgment of experienced managers. One approach is to look at 20 or 30 years of data and choose the most extreme events as scenarios. Sometimes there is a shortage of  
data on a key variable. It is then sensible to choose a similar variable for which much more data is available and use historical daily percentage changes in that variable as a proxy for possible daily percentage changes in the key variable. For example, if there is little data on the prices of bonds issued by a particular country, historical data on prices of bonds issued by other similar countries can be used to develop possible  
scenarios.
We now move on to consider lessons that are primarily relevant to financial institutions.
Monitor Traders Carefully
In trading rooms there is a tendency to regard high-performing traders as “untouch-
able” and to not subject their activities to the same scrutiny as other traders. Apparently Joseph Jett, Kidder Peabody’s star trader of Treasury instruments, was 37.2 LESSONS FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
M37_HULL0654_11_GE_C37.indd   819 30/04/2021   17:55820 CHAPTER 37
often “too busy” to answer questions and discuss his positions with the company’s risk 
managers.
All traders—particularly those making high profits—should be fully accountable. It 
is important for the financial institution to know whether the high profits are being made by taking unreasonably high risks. It is also important to check that the financial institution’s computer systems and pricing models are correct and are not being manipulated in some way.
Separate the Front, Middle, and Back Office
The front office in a financial institution consists of the traders who are executing trades, 
taking positions, and so forth. The middle office consists of risk managers who are monitoring the risks being taken. The back office is where the record keeping and accounting takes place. Some of the worst derivatives disasters have occurred because these functions were not kept separate. Nick Leeson controlled both the front and back office for Barings in Singapore and was, as a result, able to conceal the disastrous  
nature of his trades from his superiors in London for some time. Jérôme Kerviel had worked in Société Générale’s back office before becoming a trader and took advantage of his knowledge of its systems to hide his positions.
Do Not Blindly Trust Models
Some of the large losses incurred by financial institutions arose because of the models and computer systems being used. We discussed how Kidder Peabody was misled by its own systems in Business Snapshot 5.1.
If large profits are always reported when relatively simple trading strategies are 
followed, there is a good chance that the models underlying the calculation of the profits are wrong. Similarly, if a financial institution appears to be particularly competitive on its quotes for a particular type of deal, there is a good chance that it is using a different model from other market participants, and it should analyze what is  
going on carefully. To the head of a trading room, getting too much business of a certain type can be just as worrisome as getting too little business of that type.
Be Conservative in Recognizing Inception Profits
When a financial institution sells a highly exotic instrument to a nonfinancial corpora-tion, the valuation can be highly dependent on the underlying model. For example, instruments with long-dated embedded interest rate options can be highly dependent on the interest rate model used. In these circumstances, a phrase used to describe the daily marking to market of the deal is marking to model. This is because there are no market prices for similar deals that can be used as a benchmark.
Suppose that a financial institution manages to sell an instrument to a client for  
$10 million more than it is worth—or at least $10 million more than its model says it  
is worth. The $10 million is known as an inception profit. When should it be recog-nized? There appears to be quite a variation in what different financial institutions do. Some recognize the $10 million immediately, whereas others are much more conserva-tive and take reserves so that the profit (if it materializes) is recognized over the life of the deal.
M37_HULL0654_11_GE_C37.indd   820 30/04/2021   17:55Derivatives Mishaps and What We Can Learn from Them 821
Recognizing model-based inception profits immediately is very dangerous. It en-
courages traders to use aggressive models, take their bonuses, and leave before the  
model and the value of the deal come under close scrutiny. It is much better to  
recognize inception profits slowly, so that traders have the motivation to investigate 
the impact of several different models and several different sets of assumptions before committing themselves to a deal.
Do Not Sell Clients Inappropriate Products
It is tempting to sell corporate clients inappropriate products, particularly when they appear to have an appetite for the underlying risks. But this is shortsighted. The most dramatic example of this is the activities of Bankers Trust (BT) in the period leading up to the spring of 1994. Many of BT’s clients were persuaded to buy high-risk and totally inappropriate products. A typical product (e.g., the 
5>30 swap discussed in Business 
Snapshot 34.4) would give the client a good chance of saving a few basis points on its 
borrowings and a small chance of costing a large amount of money. The products worked well for BT’s clients in 1992 and 1993, but blew up in 1994 when interest rates rose sharply. The bad publicity that followed hurt BT greatly. The years it had spent building up trust among corporate clients and developing an enviable reputation for innovation in derivatives were largely lost as a result of the activities of a few overly aggressive salesmen. BT was forced to pay large amounts of money to its clients to settle lawsuits out of court. It was taken over by Deutsche Bank in 1999.
Beware of Easy Profits
Enron provides an example of how overly aggressive deal makers can cost the banks they work for billions of dollars. Doing business with Enron seemed very profitable and banks competed with each other for this business. But the fact that many banks push  
hard to get a certain type of business should not be taken as an indication that the  
business will ultimately be profitable. The business that Enron did with banks resulted in shareholder lawsuits that were very expensive for the banks. In general, transactions where high profits seem easy to achieve should be looked at closely for hidden risks.
Investing in the AAA-rated tranches of the ABS CDOs that were created from 
subprime mortgages (see Chapter 8) seemed like a fantastic opportunity. The promised returns were much higher than the returns normally earned on AAA-rated instruments. Many investors did not stop to ask whether the extra returns reflected risks not taken into account by the rating agencies.
Do Not Ignore Liquidity Risk
Financial engineers usually base the pricing of exotic instruments and other instru-ments that trade relatively infrequently on the prices of actively traded instruments. For example:
1. A financial engineer often calculates a zero curve from actively traded government bonds (known as on-the-run bonds) and uses it to price government bonds that trade less frequently (off-the-run bonds).
2. A financial engineer often implies the volatility of an asset from actively traded 
options and uses it to price less actively traded options.
M37_HULL0654_11_GE_C37.indd   821 30/04/2021   17:55822 CHAPTER 37
3. A financial engineer often implies information about the behavior of interest rates 
from actively traded interest rate caps and swap options and uses it to price nonstandard interest rate derivatives that are less actively traded.
These practices are not unreasonable. However, it is dangerous to assume that less actively traded instruments can always be traded at close to their theoretical price. When financial markets experience a shock of one sort or another there is often a “flight to quality. ” Liquidity becomes very important to investors, and illiquid instru-ments often sell at a big discount to their theoretical values. This happened in 2007–9 following the jolt to credit markets caused by lack of confidence in securities backed by subprime mortgages.
Another example of losses arising from liquidity risk is provided by Long-Term 
Capital Management (LTCM), which was discussed in Business Snapshot 2.2. This 
hedge fund followed a strategy known as convergence arbitrage. It attempted to identify two securities (or portfolios of securities) that should in theory sell for the same price. If the market price of one security was less that of the other, it would buy that security and sell the other. The strategy is based on the idea that if two securities have the same theoretical price their market prices should eventually be the same.
In the summer of 1998 LTCM made a huge loss. This was largely because a default  
by Russia on its debt caused a flight to quality. LTCM tended to be long illiquid instruments and short the corresponding liquid instruments (for example, it was long off-the-run bonds and short on-the-run bonds). The spreads between the prices of illiquid instruments and the corresponding liquid instruments widened sharply after the Russian default. LTCM was highly leveraged. It experienced huge losses and there were margin calls on its positions that it found difficult to meet.
The LTCM story reinforces the importance of carrying out scenario analyses and 
stress testing to look at what can happen in the worst of all worlds. LTCM could have tried to examine other times in history when there had been extreme flights to quality to quantify the liquidity risks it was facing.
Beware When Everyone Is Following the Same Trading Strategy
It sometimes happens that many market participants are following essentially the same trading strategy. This creates a dangerous environment where there are liable to be big market moves, unstable markets, and large losses for the market participants.
We gave one example of this in Chapter 19 when discussing portfolio insurance and 
the market crash of October 1987. In the months leading up to the crash, increasing numbers of portfolio managers were attempting to insure their portfolios by creating synthetic put options. They bought stocks or stock index futures after a rise in the market and sold them after a fall. This created an unstable market. A relatively small decline in stock prices could lead to a wave of selling by portfolio insurers. The latter would lead to a further decline in the market, which could give rise to another wave of selling, and so on. There is little doubt that without portfolio insurance the crash of October 1987 would have been much less severe.
Another example is provided by LTCM in 1998. Its position was made more difficult 
by the fact that many other hedge funds were following similar convergence arbitrage strategies to its own. After the Russian default and the flight to quality, LTCM tried to liquidate part of its portfolio to meet margin calls. Unfortunately, other hedge funds were facing similar problems to LTCM and trying to do similar trades. This exacerbated 
M37_HULL0654_11_GE_C37.indd   822 30/04/2021   17:55Derivatives Mishaps and What We Can Learn from Them 823
the situation, causing liquidity spreads to be even higher than they would otherwise have 
been and reinforcing the flight to quality. Consider, for example, LTCM’s position in U.S. Treasury bonds. It was long the illiquid off-the-run bonds and short the liquid on- the-run bonds. When a flight to quality caused spreads between yields on the two types of  
bonds to widen, LTCM had to liquidate its positions by selling off-the-run bonds and buying on-the-run bonds. Other large hedge funds were doing the same. As a result, the price of on-the-run bonds rose relative to off-the-run bonds and the spread between the two yields widened even more than it had done already.
A further example is provided by the activities of British insurance companies in the 
late 1990s. These insurance companies had entered into many contracts promising that the rate of interest applicable to annuities would be the greater of the market rate and a guaranteed rate. The insurance companies stood to lose money if long-term interest rates fell below the guaranteed rate. For various reasons, they all entered into deriva-tives transactions to partially hedge their risks at about the same time. The financial institutions on the other side of the derivatives transactions hedged their risks by buying huge numbers of long-dated sterling bonds. As a result, bond prices rose and sterling  
long-term interest rates declined. More bonds had to be bought to maintain the  
dynamic hedge, sterling long-term interest rates declined further, and so on. The financial institutions lost money and insurance companies found themselves in a worse position on the risks that they had chosen not to hedge.
The key lesson to be learned from these stories is that there can be big risks in 
situations where many market participants are following the same trading strategy.
Do Not Make Excessive Use of Short-Term Funding for  
Long-Term Needs
All financial institutions finance long-term needs with short-term sources of funds to some extent. But a financial institution that relies too heavily on short-term funds is likely to expose itself to unacceptable liquidity risks.
Suppose that a financial institution funds long-term needs by rolling over commercial 
paper every month. Commercial paper issued on April 1 would be redeemed with the proceeds of a new commercial paper issue on May 1; this new commercial paper issue would be redeemed with the proceeds of a commercial paper issue on June 1; and so on.  
Provided that the financial institution is perceived as healthy, there should be no problem. But if investors lose confidence in the financial institution (rightly or wrongly), it becomes impossible to roll over commercial paper and the financial institution experiences severe liquidity problems.
Many of the failures of financial institutions during the financial crisis (e.g., Lehman  
Brothers and Northern Rock) were largely caused by excessive reliance on short-term  
funding. It is not surprising that the Basel Committee, which is responsible for  
regulating banks internationally, has introduced liquidity ratios which banks must satisfy.
Market Transparency Is Important
One of the lessons from the credit crunch of 2007 is that market transparency is important. During the period leading up to 2007, investors traded highly structured products without any real knowledge of the underlying assets. All they knew was the credit rating of the security being traded. With hindsight, we can say that investors should 
M37_HULL0654_11_GE_C37.indd   823 30/04/2021   17:55824 CHAPTER 37
have demanded more information about the underlying assets and should have more 
carefully assessed the risks they were taking—but it is easy to be wise after the event!
The subprime meltdown of August 2007 caused investors to lose confidence in all 
structured products and withdraw from that market. This led to a market breakdown where tranches of structured products could only be sold at prices well below their theoretical values. There was a flight to quality and credit spreads increased. If there had been market transparency so that investors understood the asset-backed securities they were buying, there would still have been subprime losses, but the flight to quality and disruptions to the market would have been less pronounced.
Manage Incentives
A key lesson from the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008 is the importance of incentives. The bonus systems in banks tend to emphasize short-term performance. Some financial institutions have switched to systems where the payment for performance in a year is spread out over a number of future years and part of the bonus may be “clawed back” if it turns out that performance was not as good as originally thought. This has obvious advantages. It discourages traders from doing trades that will look good in the short run, but may “blow up” in a few years.
When loans are securitized, it is important to try and align the interests of the party 
originating the loan with the party who bears the ultimate risk so that agency costs are minimized. One way of doing this is for regulators to require the originator of a loan portfolio to keep a stake in all the tranches and other instruments that are created from the portfolio.
Never Ignore Risk Management
When times are good (or appear to be good), there is a tendency to assume that nothing can go wrong and ignore the output from stress tests and other analyses carried out by the risk management group. There are many stories of risk managers not being listened to in the period leading up to the financial crisis of 2007. Chuck Prince, CEO of  
Citigroup, said in a much quoted interview with the Financial Times in July 2007 (just before the financial crisis):
When the music stops, in terms of liquidity, things will be complicated. But as long as the 
music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance. We’re still dancing.
No doubt he regretted the comment later. As it turned out, Citigroup’s losses from the 
financial crisis were over $50 billion. Mr. Prince lost his job later in 2007.
We now consider lessons primarily applicable to nonfinancial corporations.
Make Sure You Fully Understand the Trades You Are Doing
Corporations should never undertake a trade or a trading strategy that they do not 
fully understand. This is a somewhat obvious point, but it is surprising how often a trader working for a nonfinancial corporation will, after a big loss, admit to not 37.3 LESSONS FOR NONFINANCIAL CORPORATIONS
M37_HULL0654_11_GE_C37.indd   824 30/04/2021   17:55Derivatives Mishaps and What We Can Learn from Them 825
knowing what was really going on and claim to have been misled by investment 
bankers. Robert Citron, the treasurer of Orange County did this. So did the traders working for Hammersmith and Fulham, who in spite of their huge positions were surprisingly uninformed about how the swaps and other interest rate derivatives they traded really worked.
If a senior manager in a corporation does not understand a trade proposed by a 
subordinate, the trade should not be approved. A simple rule of thumb is that if a trade and the rationale for entering into it are so complicated that they cannot be understood by the manager, it is almost certainly inappropriate for the corporation. The trades undertaken by Procter & Gamble and Gibson Greetings would have been vetoed using this criterion.
One way of ensuring that you fully understand a financial instrument is to value it. If a  
corporation does not have the in-house capability to value an instrument, it should not trade it. In practice, corporations often rely on their derivatives dealers for valuation information. This is dangerous, as Procter & Gamble and Gibson Greetings found out. When they wanted to unwind their deals, they found they were facing prices produced by  
Bankers Trust’s proprietary models, which they had no way of checking.
Make Sure a Hedger Does Not Become a Speculator
One of the unfortunate facts of life is that hedging is relatively dull, whereas speculation is exciting. When a company hires a trader to manage the risks in exchange rates,  
commodity prices, or interest rates, there is a danger that the following might happen. At first, the trader does the job diligently and earns the confidence of top management. The trader assesses the company’s exposures and hedges them. As time goes by, the trader becomes convinced that he or she can outguess the market. Slowly the trader becomes a speculator. At first things go well, but then a loss is made. To recover the  
loss, the trader doubles up the bets. Further losses might then be made, and so on. The result is liable to be a disaster.
As mentioned earlier, clear limits to the risks that can be taken should be set by 
senior management. Controls should be put in place to ensure that the limits are  
obeyed. The trading strategy for a corporation should start with an analysis of the  
risks facing the corporation in foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity markets, etc. A decision should then be taken on how the risks are to be reduced to acceptable levels. It is a clear sign that something is wrong within a corporation if the trading strategy is not derived in a very direct way from the company’s exposures.
Be Cautious about Making the Treasury Department a  
Profit Center
In the last 20 years there has been a tendency to make the treasury department within a corporation a profit center. This appears to have much to recommend it. The treasurer is motivated to reduce financing costs and manage risks as profitably as possible. The problem is that the potential for the treasurer to make profits is limited. When raising funds and investing surplus cash, the treasurer is facing an efficient market. The treasurer can usually improve the bottom line only by taking additional risks. The  
company’s hedging program gives the treasurer some scope for making shrewd decisions that increase profits. But it should be remembered that the goal of a hedging program is

to reduce risks, not to increase expected profits. As pointed out in Chapter 3, the  
decision to hedge will lead to a worse outcome than the decision not to hedge roughly 
50% of the time. The danger of making the treasury department a profit center is that the treasurer is motivated to become a speculator. This is liable to lead to the type of outcome experienced by Orange County, Procter & Gamble, or Gibson Greetings.
SUMMARY
The huge losses experienced from the use of derivatives have made many treasurers very wary. Following some of the losses, some nonfinancial corporations have announced plans to reduce or even eliminate their use of derivatives. This is unfortunate because derivatives provide treasurers with very efficient ways to manage risks.
The stories behind the losses emphasize the point, made as early as Chapter 1, that 
derivatives can be used for either hedging or speculation; that is, they can be used either to reduce risks or to take risks. Most losses occurred because derivatives were used inappropriately. Employees who had an implicit or explicit mandate to hedge their company’s risks decided instead to speculate.
The key lesson to be learned from the losses is the importance of internal controls. 
Senior management within a company should issue a clear and unambiguous policy statement about how derivatives are to be used and the extent to which it is permissible for employees to take positions on movements in market variables. Management should then institute controls to ensure that the policy is carried out. It is a recipe for disaster to give individuals authority to trade derivatives without a close monitoring of the risks being taken.

DerivaGem 4.00 accompanies this book. It enables readers to value many of the  
products that are discussed.
Getting Started
The most difficult part of using any software is getting started. Here is a step-by-step 
guide to using DerivaGem 4.00 for the first time.
1. Go to www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull/software and download DerivaGem 4.00. Unzip the file to obtain DG400a.xls, DG400 functions.xls, and DG400 Applica-tions.xls. Open Excel file DG400a.xls.
2. You will need to make sure that macros are enabled. If Enable Content, Enable 
Editing or Enable Macros appear at the top of the worksheet click on them. For some versions of Windows and Office, you may need to make sure that security for macros is set at medium or low.
3. Click on the Equity_FX_Indx_Fut_Opts_Calc worksheet at the bottom of the page.
4. Choose Currency as the Underlying Type and Binomial: American as the Option 
Type. Click on the Put button. Leave Imply Volatility unchecked.
5. You are now all set to value an American put option on a currency. There are seven inputs: exchange rate, volatility, domestic risk-free rate, foreign risk-free rate, time to expiration (years), exercise price, and time steps. Input these in cells D5, D6, D7 , D8, D13, D14, and D15 as 1.61, 12%, 8%, 9%, 1.0, 1.60, and 4, respectively.
6. Hit Enter on your keyboard and click on Calculate. You will see the price of the 
option in cell D20 as 0.07099 and the Greek letters in cells D21 to D25. Part of your screen display should now be as shown on the following page.
7. Click on Display Tree. You will see the binomial tree used to calculate the option. This is Figure 21.6 in Chapter 21 (but with more decimal places).
Next Steps
You should now have no difficulty valuing other types of option on other underlyings with the Equity_FX_Indx_Fut_Opts_Calc  worksheet. To imply a volatility, check the 
Imply Volatility  box and input the option price in cell D20. Hit Enter  and click on 
Calculate . The implied volatility is displayed in cell D6.

Many different charts can be displayed below the results. To display a chart, you 
must first choose the variable you require on the vertical (Y) axis, the variable you 
require on the horizontal (X) axis, the range of X-values to be considered, and the number of X-values to be considered. Following that, you should click on Draw Graph.
Other points to note about the Equity_FX_Indx_Fut_Opts_Calc worksheet are:
1. For European and American equity options, up to 7 dividends on the underlying  
stock can be input in a table that pops up. Enter the time of each dividend  
(measured in years from today) in the first column and the amount of the  
dividend in the second column.
2. Up to 500 time steps can be used for the valuation of American options, but only a maximum of 10 time steps can be displayed.
3. Greek letters for all options other than standard calls and puts are calculated by perturbing the inputs, not by using analytic formulas.
4. For an Asian option the Current Average is the average price since inception. For a new deal (with zero time since inception), the current average is irrelevant.
5. In the case of a lookback option, Minimum to Date is used when a call is valued and Maximum to Date is used when a put is valued. For a new deal, these should 
be set equal to the current price of the underlying asset.
6. Interest rates are continuously compounded with an Actual/Actual day count.
The Alternative Models worksheet operates like the Equity_FX_Indx_Fut_Opts_Calc 
worksheet. Options can be valued using lognormal, CEV , Merton mixed jump–diffusion,  
variance-gamma, Heston, and SABR models. Choose chart where implied volatility is Y-axis and strike price is X-axis to display volatility smiles.

Monte Carlo Simulation
In the Monte Carlo  worksheet, users can see how a number of different types of options 
are valued using the lognormal, Merton mixed jump–diffusion, and variance-gamma 
models. Up to 10,000 simulation trials can be used. Full results from ten trials are  
displayed. When the Do AntiThetic  box is checked, these are averaged in pairs to  
produce five sample values. When it is not checked, there are ten sample values.  
Standard errors from both the full simulation and the ten displayed trials are shown.
Zero Curve
The Zero_Curve  worksheet allows you to calculate OIS and Treasury zero curves as 
described in Sections 4.7 and 7.2. Bond yields and OIS rates are input with a compound -
ing frequency corresponding to the frequency of payments as in Tables 4.3 and 7.3. The calculated zero rates are continuously compounded. Accrual periods are assumed to be exact fractions of a year and day counts are Actual/Actual.
Swaps
The Swap_Price  worksheet allows standard fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps to be 
valued using OIS discounting. Points on the OIS zero curve are input with continuous  
compounding. (The points could be transferred from the Zero_Curve  worksheet.)  
Forward rates for the floating reference rate must also be input. These are forward rates for periods beginning at the specified time and ending one period later, with the length of the period corresponding to the settlement frequency. The forward rates are expressed with a compounding frequency corresponding to the settlement frequency. For a swap where the floating rate is set at the beginning of an accrual period and paid at the end, the Next Floating (%) is the rate per annum that was set on the last reset date. For a swap based on overnight rates, the Next Floating (%) should reflect the overnight rates already observed and the forward rate corresponding to the overnight rates that are still to be observed. Thus, in Example 7.1, the Next Floating (%) would  
be input as 2.516% and forward rates for times 0.2 and 0.7 years would be input as 3.388% and 3.714%, respectively. The OIS zeros for maturities 0.2, 0.7, and 1.2 years would be input as 2.8%, 3.2%, and 3.4%, respectively. The Swap End (Years) would be 1.2 and the Swap Rate (%), which is input with a compounding frequency correspond -
ing to the settlement frequency, would be 3%. The software uses linear interpolation to  
determine any required zero rates and forward rates that have not been specified.
Bond Options
The general operation of the Bond_Options  worksheet is similar to that of earlier  
worksheets. The alternative models are Black’s model (see Section 29.1), the normal model of the short rate (see equation (32.4)), and the lognormal model of the short rate  
(see equation (32.9)). The first model can be applied only to European options. The other two can be applied to European or American options. The coupon is the rate paid per year and the frequency of payments can be selected as Quarterly, Semi-Annual or Annual. The zero-coupon yield curve is entered in the table labeled Term Structure. Enter maturities (measured in years) in the first column and the corresponding con -
tinuously compounded rates in the second column. DerivaGem assumes a piecewise 
Z02_HULL0654_11_GE_DGSW.indd   853 30/04/2021   17:57854 DerivaGem Software
linear zero curve similar to that in Figures 4.1 and 7.2. The strike price can be quoted 
(clean) or cash (dirty) (see Section 29.1). The quoted bond price, which is calculated by the software, and the strike price, which is input, are per $100 of principal.
Caps and Swaptions
The general operation of the Caps_and Swap_Options  worksheet is similar to that of 
other worksheets. The worksheet is used to value interest rate caps/floors and swap options. Black’s model for caps and floors is explained in Section 29.2. (The software values caps and floors where the interest rate is observed at the beginning of an accrual period and paid at the end of the accrual period.) Black’s model for European swap options is explained in Section 29.3. The shifted lognormal model and the Bachelier (normal) model are also described in these sections. The frequency of payments can be  
selected as Monthly, Quarterly, Semi-Annual, or Annual. The software calculates  
payment dates by working backward from the end of the life of the instrument. The initial accrual period for a cap/floor may be a nonstandard length between 0.5 and 1.5 times a normal accrual period. OIS discounting is used. Data on forward rates for the floating reference rate and OIS zero rates are input in the same way as for the Swaps  
worksheet. In the case of swap options, the forward rates are used only to determine the  
forward swap rate. If the forward swap rate is known, it is sufficient to input a single forward rate and set it as this rate.
CDSs
The CDS worksheet is used to calculate hazard rates from CDS spreads, and vice versa. Users must input a term structure of interest rates (continuously compounded) and either a term structure of CDS spreads or a term structure of hazard rates. The initial hazard rate applies from time zero to the time specified; the second hazard rate applies from the time corresponding to the first hazard rate to the time corresponding to the second hazard rate; and so on. The calculations are carried out assuming that default can occur only at points midway between payment dates. This corresponds to the  
calculations for the example in Section 25.2.
CDOs
The CDO worksheet calculates quotes for the tranches of CDOs from tranche correla -
tions input by the user. The attachment points and detachment points for tranches are input by the user. The quotes can be in basis points or involve an upfront payment. In the latter case, the spread in basis points is fixed and the upfront payment, as a percent of the tranche principal, is either input or implied. (For example, the fixed spread for the equity tranche of iTraxx Europe or CDX NA IG is 500 basis points.) The number of integration points (see equation (25.12)) defines the accuracy of calculations and can be left as 10 for  
most purposes (the maximum is 30). The software displays the expected loss as a percent of the tranche principal (ExpLoss) and the present value of expected payments (PVPmts)  
at the rate of 10,000 basis points per year. The spread and upfront payment are
ExpLoss * 10,000/PVPmts and ExpLoss − (Spread * PVPmts/10,000)
respectively. The worksheet can be used to imply either tranche (compound) correla-tions or base correlations from quotes input by the user. For base correlations to be 
Z02_HULL0654_11_GE_DGSW.indd   854 30/04/2021   17:57DerivaGem Software 855
calculated, it is necessary for the first attachment point to be 0% and the detachment 
point for one tranche to be the attachment point for the next tranche.
How Greek Letters Are Defined
In the Equity_FX_Index_Futures  worksheet, the Greek letters are defined as follows:
 Delta:  Change in option price per dollar increase in underlying asset
 Gamma:  Change in delta per dollar increase in underlying asset
 Vega:  Change in option price per 1% increase in volatility (e.g., volatility increases from 20% to 21%)
 Rho:  Change in option price per 1% increase in interest rate (e.g., interest  
increases from 5% to 6%)
 Theta:  Change in option price per calendar day passing.
For instruments dependent on interest rates, the Greek letters are defined as follows:
 DV01:  Change in option price per 1 -basis-point upward parallel shift in the zero 
curve
 Gamma:  Change in DV01 for an upward parallel shift in the zero curve (Gamma is per % per %)
 Vega:  Change in option price when volatility parameter increases by 1% (e.g.,  
volatility increases from 20% to 21%).
The Applications Builder
Once you are familiar with the Options calculator (DG400a.xls), you may want to start using the Application Builder (DG400 applications.xls). You can also develop your own  
applications with DG400 functions.xls. This contains the functions underlying Deriva -
Gem with VBA source code. The applications included with the software are:
A. Binomial Convergence. This investigates the convergence of the binomial model in Chapters 13 and 21.
B. Greek Letters. This provides charts showing the Greek letters in Chapter 19.
C. Delta Hedge. This investigates the performance of delta hedging as in Tables 19.2 and 19.3.
D. Delta and Gamma Hedge. This investigates the performance of delta plus gamma hedging for a position in a binary option.
E. Value and Risk. This calculates Value at Risk for a portfolio using three different approaches.
F. Barrier Replication. This carries out calculations for static options replication (see Section 26.17).
G. Trinomial Convergence. This investigates the convergence of a trinomial tree model.
