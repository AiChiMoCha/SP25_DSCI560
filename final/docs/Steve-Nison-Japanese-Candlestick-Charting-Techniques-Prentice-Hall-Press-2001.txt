PREFACE

He} SMSM & ha

A clever hawk hides it claws.

t’s hard to believe that Japanese candlestick charts, the

“claws” of Japanese technical analysis, were completely
unknown to the Western world before I revealed them to the
Western hemisphere in 1989. Candlestick charts are now so
prevalent that it is hard to imagine that before the first edition
of this book, no one in the West knew about these wonderful
techniques and not one charting service had candlestick charts.
This is amazing to me, considering that candlestick charts are
now available on almost every charting service.

Iam proud to say that Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques
quickly became the foundation of all candlestick charting work
in the West. The first edition of this book is why you now have
candlestick charts on the Internet and anywhere else they are
available. Illustrating the universal popularity and effective-
ness of candle charts, the book has been translated into six lan-
guages and has gone through thirteen printings.

Preface

The tools, techniques, and topics offered in the first edition of
this book are ageless and useable in all markets and time
frames. But through cogent logic (and holding my dog
hostage!) the editor of this edition convinced me it was time for
a new edition.

Some of the fresh aspects of this book include updated
charts, more equity markets, a focus on active trading via intra-
day charts, new refinements and strategies, and fresh combina-
tions of Western technical analysis with candlestick charting
tools.

In a public seminar, I asked the audience to write what they
hoped to get from the seminar. Someone wrote, “To make big
$$$.” While I can’t guarantee “big $$$” I expect that the tools,
strategies, and techniques in this book will go a long way to
improve your trading and decrease risk exposure.

Thank you for making the first edition of this book so popu-
lar. I know you will find this one as valuable, practical, and
entertaining.

I would enjoy hearing your comments, experiences, and
ideas with candle charts. I welcome your e-mail at info@can-
dlecharts.com and invite you to visit our site at www.can-
dlecharts.com. While I can’t guarantee a reply, all your e-mails
and letters will be read.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

DE LBTNLEAT AD & ib B/LEA L.

Do not forget little kindnesses and do not remember small faults.

| want to thank all of you who have helped ignite the flames
of interest in candle charts. The overwhelmingly positive
feedback keeps the lights of the candles growing ever brighter.

To my institutional and public seminar attendees, advisory
clients, and online clients, I want to thank you for your contin-
ued support and kind words.

A Japanese proverb says that, “One evening’s conversation
with a superior man is better than ten years of study.” It is my
pleasure to acknowledge the superior men and women who
have so generously helped me.

Many of those who deserve recognition for their help are
mentioned in Chapter 1. There are others whom I would like to
thank for their help in lighting my path. There were so many
who contributed to this project that if I have forgotten to men-
tion anyone I apologize for this oversight.

Acknowledgments

The underpinnings for all my research on candles are the
translations provided by Richard Solberg. His acquisitions of
the Japanese candle charting books, his ideas, and his work
provided the scaffolding for the rest of my candle endeavors.

The Market Technicians Association (MTA) deserves special
mention. It was at the MTA’s library that I first discovered can-
dle material written in English. This material, albeit scant, was
extremely difficult to obtain, but the marvelously complete
MTA library had it.

Yoji Inata spent many hours answering my more advanced
questions. He was also kind enough to contact his peers in
Japan to get more detailed answers if necessary.

The Nippon Technical Analysts Association (NTAA)
deserves utmost praise for their assistance. Mr. Kojiiro
Watanabe helped me to contact NTAA members who have
been especially helpful. They are: Mr. Minoru Eda and Mr.
Yasushi Hayashi Nori Hayashi.

There are many candle charting software programs available.
For this book I used two of what I consider the best: Aspen
Graphics (www.Aspenres.com) and CQG (www.cqg.com).
Their products and support are top-notch.

Just as I did in the first edition, I again want to thank “idea a
day” Bruce Kamich. Bruce is a friend and a fellow technician
with over 25 years’ experience. He continues to provide many
valuable ideas and suggestions.

Mark Tunkel, a friend and a colleague for many years, has
powerful insights into candle charts. His help on this book is
much appreciated.

Susan Barry, the editor for the first edition of this book, had
the foresight to convince her boss that candles would be popu-
lar enough to take a chance on a book. The increasing sales
since its initial publication in 1991 have confirmed her thinking.

For this edition, Ellen Schneid Coleman and Sybil Grace at
Prentice Hall have taken the coal of this book and made it into
a diamond.

Of course, there is my family. It’s hard to believe that my son
was just born when I wrote the first edition. (He’s now 11.) I
told him that I came close to calling him Candlesticks Nison.
That name would be appropriate. Evan’s a very quick learner—
especially when it comes to finances—and can’t absorb candle
charting fast enough. I think we will put our family finances in
his hands.


--- 第 8 页 ---

Rebecca, four years old when the first edition was published,
is a very bright young lady now. She makes me proud to be her
father. If we put our finances in her hands, we would be home-
less, but would have lots of clothing and make-up.

My wife Bonnie continues to be our cornerstone. Without
her, everything would fall apart and there would be no way
this book could have been done.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

ond Fe le

ta OlkKE

The beginning is most important.

apanese candlestick chart analysis, so called because the

lines resemble candlesticks, has been refined by generations
of use in the Far East. Until the publication of Japanese Candle
Charting Techniques, the “claws” of Japanese charting analysis—
that is, candle charts—were a hidden secret from the Western
world for over a century. That book revealed in detail, for the
first time to the Western hemisphere, these “secrets of the
Orient.”

Since the term “candlesticks” is often shortened to “candles,”
I will use both terms interchangeably throughout this book.

I am flattered that my work has been credited with revolu-
tionizing technical analysis and that all subsequent books, arti-
cles, etc. by other authors have used the first edition of this
book as their underpinning. This is what I had hoped. The


--- 第 16 页 ---

Chapter 1 © Introduction

premise of that book was to lay the foundation for future can-
dle charting material. It is thus very gratifying to have this book
often called the “bible of candle charting.”

Before the publication of this book in 1991 B.C. (Before
Candlesticks), who ever heard of a candlestick chart? Now, who
hasn’t?

Online traders, day traders, institutional propriety traders,
and market makers are just some of the candle charting enthu-
siasts. Web sites, real-time trading systems, and technical anal-
ysis software packages include candle charts. This attests to the
popularity and universal appeal candles have to trading
today’s volatile markets. Candles are hotter than ever.

My 11-year-old son Evan (who was almost called
Candlesticks Nison when he was born) saw an online charting
service that had candle charts. He said, “Daddy, so if it wasn’t
for you, there would be no candle charts on the Web or any-
where in America. Is that right?” I said that was true. He hesi-
tated and then said, “Cool, I want a raise in my allowance.”

WHAT'S NEW IN THIS BOOK

While the format and underlying concepts are the same as the
first edition (if it ain’t broke don’t fix it), the trading environ-
ment and players in the market have changed since that edition.
Consequently, besides having all new charts, this edition has:

¢ more intraday markets

* more focus on active trading for swing, online, and day
traders

new tactics for getting maximum use from intraday charts

© new Western techniques in combination with candles

a greater focus on capital preservation

WHY HAVE CANDLE CHARTING
TECHNIQUES CAPTURED THE ATTENTION
OF TRADERS AND INVESTORS AROUND THE
WORLD?

Year after year the flames of interest grow ever brighter for
these charting tools. This is because candle charts:

Chapter 1 © Introduction 3

¢ Are easy to understand: Anyone, from the first-time chartist to
the seasoned professional, can easily harness the power of
candle charts. Don’t let the simplicity of these tools fool you.
Their power to analyze the health of the market is
unmatched by any other charting methodology.

Provide earlier indications of market turns: Candle charts often
send out reversal signals well before those of traditional indi-
cators on bar or point and figure charts. This should help you
to enter and exit the market with better timing.

© Furnish unique market insights: Candle charts not only show
the trend of the move, as does a bar chart, but, unlike bar
charts, candle charts also show the force underpinning the
move.

Are enjoyable to learn: The picturesque terms such as dark-
cloud covers, hammers, and windows make candle charts fun to
use. But don’t let the “picturesque” names fool you. These
techniques will be potent weapons in your battle with the
markets.

Enhance Western charting analysis: Candle charts are so versa-
tile, they can be fused with any Western technical tool. For
our clients, we merge the insights given by the candle charts
with the most potent Western technical analysis tools. If you
are a seasoned technician, you will discover how joining
Japanese candles with your favorite technical tools can create
a powerful synergy of techniques. This merging of Eastern
and Western analysis will give you a jump on those who use
only traditional Western charting techniques.

Will increase efficiency of your analysis: Because of the immedi-
ate visual information sent out by the candle charts, they will
make your market analysis faster and more efficient.

As the Oriental proverb states, “The journey of a thousand
miles begins with the first step.” This chapter is that first step,
albeit an important one, on the road to candle chart analysis.
Yet, even after this introductory chapter, you will discover how
the candles will help make your market analysis more efficient,
improve entry and exit timing, and open new, effective, and
unique avenues of analysis.

I made a bold forecast in the first edition of this book. I said,
“In the near future, candle charts may become as standard as

Chapter 1 © Introduction

the bar chart. As more technical analysts become comfortable
with candle charts, they will no longer use bar charts.” This,
indeed, is what is unfolding.

At the conclusion of my institutional and public seminars, I
often ask the audience, “How many of you will now use bar
charts?” Of the thousands of traders who have taken my semi-
nars, no one has ever raised a hand. If you are new to candles,
you will understand why after reading this book (or even the
first few chapters).

Using candle charts instead of bar charts is a win-win situ-
ation. As we will see in the chapter on drawing candle lines,
the same data is required to draw the candle charts as for the
bar charts (open, high, low, and close). This is very significant.
It means that any of the technical analyses used with bar
charts (such as moving averages, trendlines, retracements,
etc.) can be employed with candle charts. But, and this is the
key point, candle charts can send signals not available with
bar charts. This aspect will give you a jump on those who use
only traditional Western charting techniques. By employing
candle charts instead of bar charts, you have the ability to use
all the same analyses as you could use with bar charts. But
candle charts send out insights into the health of the market
that are unavailable anywhere else.

WHO IS THIS BOOK FOR?
This book is for you if:

¢ Your charting service has candle charts and you want to
unlock their full potential.

You want to get a jump on the competition.

You would like to enter and exit the market with better timing.

You want added value techniques to complement trading
tools you now use.

You want to have fun while you learn.

* You are new to candle charts or are a seasoned pro.

SOME BACKGROUND

“Why,” I have often asked myself, “has a system that has been
around so long been almost completely unknown in the West?”
Were the Japanese trying to keep it secret? I don’t know the
answer to this, but it took years of research to fit all the pieces
together. I was fortunate in several ways. Perhaps my perse-
verance and serendipity were the unique combination needed
that others did not have.

I became acquainted with a Japanese broker in 1987. One day,
while I was with her in her office, she was looking at one of her
Japanese stock chart books (Japanese chart books are in candle
form). She exclaimed, “Look, a window.” I asked what she was
talking about. She told me a window was the same as a gap in
Western technicals. She went on to explain that while Western
technicians use the expression “filling in the gap,” the Japanese
would say “closing the window.” She then used other expres-
sions like “doji” and “dark-cloud cover.” I was hooked. I spent
the next three years exploring, researching, and analyzing any-
thing I could about candle charts.

It was not easy. My initial education was with the help of a
Japanese broker and through drawing and analyzing candle
charts on my own. Then, thanks to the Market Technicians
Association (MTA)! library in New York City, I came across a
booklet published by the Nippon Technical Analysts
Association called Analysis of Stock Price in Japan. It was a
Japanese booklet that had been translated into English.
Unfortunately, there were just ten pages on interpreting candle
charts. Nonetheless, I finally had some English candle material.

A few months later, I borrowed a book that provided some
more basic candle charting information. Once again I had found
it at the MTA library. The MTA office manager, Shelley Lebeck,
brought a book back from Japan entitled The Japanese Chart of
Charts by Seiki Shimizu and translated by Greg Nicholson (pub-
lished by the Tokyo Futures Trading Publishing Co.) back from
Japan. It was an important find since it contained about seventy
Pages on candle charts and is written in English.

Chapter 1 © Introduction

As I discovered, while the book yielded a harvest of infor-
mation, it took some effort and time to get comfortable with its
concepts. They were all so new. I also had to become comfort-
able with the Japanese terminology. The writing style was
sometimes obscure. Part of this might have to do with the dif-
ficulty of translation. The book was originally written in
Japanese about twenty-five years ago for a Japanese audience.
I also found out, when I had my own material translated, that
it is dreadfully difficult to translate such a specialized subject
from Japanese to English.

Nonetheless, I had some written reference material. I carried
the book with me for months, reading and rereading, taking
copious notes, applying the candle methods to the scores of my
hand-drawn candle charts (since there wasn’t any candle chart-
ing software, all my charts had to be constructed by hand). I
chewed and grinded away at the new ideas and terminology. I
was fortunate in another way—I had the help of the author,
Seiki Shimizu, to answer my many questions. Although Mr.
Shimizu does not speak English, the translator of the book,
Greg Nicholson, graciously acted as our intermediary via fax
messages. The Japanese Chart of Charts provided a base for the
rest of my investigation into candles.

In order to expand my nascent abilities in candle charting
techniques, I sought out Japanese candle practitioners who
would have the time and inclination to speak with me about
the subject. I met a Japanese trader, Morihiko Goto, who had
been using candle charts and who was willing to share his
valuable time and insights. This was exciting enough! Then he
told me that his family had been using candle charts for gener-
ations! We spent many hours discussing the history and the
uses of candle charts. He was an invaluable storehouse of
knowledge.

My real treasure trove of information is the Japanese candle
charting literature that I had translated. For this I had the
extreme good fortune to find a translator, Richard Solberg. His
ability to track down all the candle charting books in Japan (to
my knowledge, I have the largest collection outside Japan) and
his translating skills were invaluable.

In December 1989, I authored a two-page article on candle
charts. This was the first information on the subject ever writ-

ten by a non-Japanese. In early 1990, as my thesis for the
Chartered Market Technician exam for the MTA, I wrote a
paper on candle charts. This was the first detailed article ever
authored by an Occidental about Japanese candle charts. A
pamphlet at Merrill Lynch (which had over 10,000 requests)
soon followed.

Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques was published in
1991, followed in 1994 by Beyond Candlesticks (John Wiley). As
of this writing, these books have been translated into eight lan-
guages and have gone through many printings.

My work has been highlighted in financial media around the
world including The Wall Street Journal, The Japan Economic
Journal, Barron’s, Worth Magazine, Institutional Investor, and
scores of other publications. An appearance on FNN (the pre-
decessor to CNBC) drew the largest audience that station ever
had.

I've had the privilege of revealing my trading strategies to
thousands of traders and analysts in over seventeen countries,
including, of all places, Hanoi, Vietnam. I also had the honor of
speaking before the World Bank and the Federal Reserve.

I founded Nison Research International in 1997 to provide
institutional on-site customized seminars and analytical ser-
vices.

I formed Candlecharts.Com in 2000, which offers Web-based
seminars, videos, and other services. I invite you to visit our
site at www.candlecharts.com.

WHAT IS IN THIS BOOK?

In the first part of the book, you'll learn how to draw and inter-
pret scores of candle lines and formations. This will slowly and
clearly lay a solid foundation for Part 2 where you will discov-
er the value of integrating candles with Western technical tech-
niques. My goal is not to give you market omniscience. My
hope is that the ideas in this book will show how Japanese can-
dles can “enlighten” your trading.

The best way to explain how an indicator works is through
marketplace examples. The Japanese say, “One seeing is better
than a hundred hearings.” Therefore, there will be numerous
real-world examples of each technique.

Chapter 1 © Introduction

My focus will be mainly on the U.S. markets, but the tools
and techniques in this book are applicable to any market and
time frame. This is attested by the fact that candle charts are
used on weekly (for hedgers), daily (for swing and intermedi-
ate term traders), and intraday charts (for swing and day
traders). The tactics addressed in this book can be used for
equities, futures, options, foreign exchange—anywhere and in
any time frame in which technical analysis is applied.

I have drawn illustrations of candle patterns to assist in the
educational process. These illustrations are representative
examples only. The drawn exhibits should be viewed in the
context that they show certain guidelines and principles. The
actual patterns do not have to look exactly as they do in the
exhibits in order to provide you with a valid signal. This is
emphasized throughout the book in the many chart examples.
You will see how variations of the patterns can still provide
important clues about the state of the markets.

Thus, there is some subjectivity in deciding whether a certain
candle formation meets the guidelines for that particular for-
mation, but this subjectivity is no different from that with other
charting techniques. For instance, if a stock has support at $100,
is support considered broken if prices go under $100 intraday,
or do prices have to close under $100? Does a 50-cent penetra-
tion of $100 substantiate broken support or is a larger penetra-
tion needed? You will have to decide these answers based on
your trading temperament, your risk adversity, and your mar-
ket philosophy. Likewise, through text, illustrations, and real-
world examples I will provide the general principles and
guidelines for recognizing the candle formations. But you
should not expect the real-world examples to always match
their ideal formations.

Two glossaries are at the end of the book. The first includes
candle terms and the second, Western technical terms used in
the book. The candle glossary includes a visual glossary of all
the patterns.

SOME CAUTIONS

As with any subjective form of technical analysis, there are, at
times, variable definitions that will be defined according to the


--- 第 23 页 ---

users’ experience and background. This is true of some candle
patterns. Depending on my source of information, there were
instances in which I came across different, albeit usually minor,
definitions of what constitutes a certain pattern. For example,
one Japanese author writes that the open has to be above the
prior close in order to complete a dark-cloud cover pattern.
Other written and oral sources say that, for this pattern, the
open should be above the prior high.

In cases where there were different definitions, I chose the
tules that increased the probability that the pattern’s forecast
would be correct. For example, the pattern referred to in the
prior paragraph is a reversal signal that appears at tops. Thus, I
chose the definition that the market should open above the prior
day’s high. This is because it is potentially more bearish if the
market opens above the prior day’s high and then fails, versus if
the market opens above the prior day’s close and then failed.

Much of the Japanese material I had translated is less than
specific. Part of this might be the result of the Japanese pen-
chant for being vague. The penchant may have its origins in the
feudal ages when it was acceptable for a samurai to behead any
commoner who did not treat him as expected. The commoner
did not always know how a samurai expected him to act or to
answer. By being vague, many heads were spared. However, I
think the more important reason for the somewhat ambiguous
explanations has to do with the fact that technical analysis is
more of an art than a science.

One should not expect rigid rules. Most forms of technical
analysis are guideposts. For instance, if one of the Japanese
books says that a candle line has to be surpassed to forecast the
next bull move, I equate “surpassed” with “on a close above.”
That is because, to me, a close is more important than an intra-
day move above resistance or below support. This is another
example of subjectivity: In the Japanese literature many candle
patterns are described as important at a high-price area or at a
low-price area. Obviously what constitutes a “high-price” or
“low-price” area is open to interpretation. One of the tech-
niques I suggest using to gauge “low” or “high” price is an
oscillator to see if the market is oversold or overbought. This is
an example of why it is valuable to add classic Western techni-
cal tools (such as oscillators) to those of candle charts.

Chapter 1 © Introduction

As with all charting methods, candle chart patterns are sub-
ject to the interpretation of the user. Extended experience with
candle charting in your market will show you which of the pat-
terns, and variations of these patterns, works best in your mar-
kets. In this sense, subjectivity may not be a liability. This may
give you an advantage over those who have not devoted the
time and energy in tracking your markets as closely as you
have.

As discussed in Chapter 3, drawing the individual candle
chart lines requires a close. Therefore, you may have to wait for
the close to get a valid trading signal. This may mean a market
on close order may be needed or you may have to try and antic-
ipate what the close will be and place an order a few minutes
prior to the close. You may also prefer to wait for the next day’s
opening before placing an order.

This aspect of waiting for a close is not unique to candle
charts. There are many technical systems (especially those
based on moving averages of closing prices) that require a clos-
ing price for a signal. This is why there is often a surge in activ-
ity during the final few minutes of a trading session as com-
puterized trading signals, based on closing prices, kick into
play. Some technicians consider only a close above resistance a
valid buy signal so they have to wait until the close for confir-
mation.

Candle charts provide many useful trading signals. They do
not, however, provide price targets. This is why it is so impor-
tant to use Western technical techniques on candle charts. This
will be a focus of Part 2.

With the hundreds of charts throughout this book, do not be
surprised if you see patterns that I have missed within charts.
There will also be examples of patterns that, at times, did not
work. No technical tool, including candles, is infallible.

Candles are not designed to be a complete system; they are
just one weapon, albeit a powerful one, to use in your trading
battles.

Before I delve into the topic of candle charts, I will briefly dis-
cuss the importance of technical analysis as a separate disci-
pline. For those of you who are new to this topic, the following
section is meant to emphasize why technical analysis is so
important. It is not an in-depth discussion. If you are already

familiar with the benefits of technical analysis, you can skip
this section. Do not worry if you do not read the following sec-
tion, it will not interfere with later candle chart analysis infor-
mation.

THE IMPORTANCE OF TECHNICAL ANALYSIS

The importance of technical analysis is multifaceted. First,
while fundamental analysis may provide a gauge of the sup-
ply/demand situations (i.e., price/earnings ratios, economic
statistics) and so forth, there is no psychological component
involved in such analysis. Yet the markets are influenced at
times, to a major extent, by emotionalism. As John Maynard
Keynes stated, “There is nothing so disastrous as a rational
investment policy in an irrational world.”* Technical analysis
provides the only mechanism to measure the “irrational” (emo-
tional) component present in all markets.

Here is an entertaining story about how strongly psychology
can affect a market. It is from the book The New Gatsbys.> It
takes place at the Chicago Board of Trade.

Soybeans were sharply higher. There was a drought in the
Illinois Soybean Belt. And unless it ended soon, there would be
a severe shortage of beans. . . . Suddenly a few drops of water
slid down a window. “Look,” someone shouted, “rain!” More
than 500 pairs of eyes [the traders—editor’s note] shifted to the
big windows. ... Then came a steady trickle, which turned into
a steady downpour. It was raining in downtown Chicago.

Sell. Buy. Buy. Sell. The shouts cascaded from the traders’ lips
with a roar that matched the thunder outside. And the price of
soybeans began to slowly move down. Then the price of soy-
beans broke like some tropic fever.

It was pouring in Chicago all right, but no one grows soybeans
in Chicago. In the heart of the Soybean Belt, some 300 miles
south of Chicago the sky was blue, sunny and very dry. But even
if it wasn’t raining on the soybean fields it was in the heads of the
traders, and that is all that counts [emphasis added]. To the market
nothing matters unless the market reacts to it. The game is played
with the mind and the emotions.” [Emphasis added.]

In order to drive home the point about the importance of
mass psychology, think about what happens when you
exchange a piece of paper called “money” for some item like


--- 第 26 页 ---

12

Chapter 1 © Introduction

food or clothing. Why is that paper, with no intrinsic value,
exchanged for something tangible? It is because of a shared
psychology. Everyone believes it will be accepted, so it is. Once
this shared psychology evaporates, when people stop believing
in money, it becomes worthless.

Second, technicals are also an important component of disci-
plined trading. Discipline helps mitigate the nemesis of all
traders, namely, emotion. As soon as you have money in the
market, emotionalism is in the driver’s seat and rationale and
objectivity are merely passengers. If you doubt this, try paper
trading. Then try trading with your own funds. You will soon
discover how deeply the counterproductive aspects of tension,
anticipation, and anxiety alter the way you trade and view the
markets—usually in proportion to the funds committed.
Technicals can put objectivity back into the driver’s seat. They
provide a mechanism to set entry and exit points, to set
risk/reward ratios, or stop out levels. By using them, you fos-
ter a risk and money management approach to trading.

As touched upon in the previous discussion, the technicals
contribute to market objectivity. It is human nature to see the
market as we want to see it, not as it really is. How often does
the following occur? A trader buys. Immediately the market
falls. Does he take a loss? Usually no.

Although there is no room for hope in the market, the trader
will glean all the fundamentally bullish news he can in order to
buoy his hope that the market will turn in his direction (as one
of our advisory clients put it, “You root for your position.”)
Meanwhile prices continue to descend. Perhaps the market is
trying to tell him something. The markets communicate with
us. We can monitor these messages by using the technicals. This
trader is closing his eyes and ears to the messages being sent by
the market.

If this trader stepped back and objectively viewed the price
activity, he might get a better feel of the market. What if a sup-
posedly bullish story is released and prices do not move up or
even fall? That type of price action is sending out volumes of
information about the psychology of the market and how one
should trade in it.

I believe it was the famous trader Jesse Livermore who
expressed the idea that one can see the whole better when one

|

sees it from a distance. Technicals make us step back and get a
different and, perhaps, better perspective on the market.

Third, following the technicals is important even if you do
not fully believe in their use. This is because, at times, the chart
actions are the major reason for a market move. Since they are
a market-moving factor, they should be watched.

Fourth, random walk proffers that the market price for one
day has no bearing on the price the following day. But this aca-
demic view leaves out an important component—people.
People remember prices from one day to the next and act
accordingly. To wit, people's reactions indeed affect price, but
price also affects people’s reactions. Thus, price, itself, is an
important component in market analysis. Those who disparage
technical analysis forget this last point.

Fifth, the price action is the most direct and easily accessible
method of seeing overall supply/demand relationships. There
may be fundamental news not known to the general public, but
you can expect it is already in the price. Those who have
advance knowledge of some market-moving event will most
likely buy or sell until current prices reflect their information.

CHAPTER 2

A HISTORICAL
BACKGROUND

x # it TML KEM

Through inquiring of the old we learn the new.

Te chapter provides the framework through which
Japanese technical analysis evolved. For those who are in a
rush to get to the “meat” of the book (that is, the techniques and
uses of candlesticks), you can skip this chapter, or return to it
after you have completed the rest of the book. It is an intrigu-
ing history.

Among the first and the most famous people in Japan to use
past prices to predict future price movements was the leg-
endary Munehisa Homma. He amassed a huge fortune trading
in the rice market during the 1700s. Before I discuss Homma,
however, I want to provide an overview of the economic back-
ground in which Homma was able to flourish. The time span of

15

this overview is from the late 1500s to the mid-1700s. During
this era Japan went from sixty provinces to a unified country
where commerce blossomed.

From 1500 to 1600, Japan was a country incessantly at war as
each of the daimyo (literally “big name” meaning “a feudal
lord”) sought to wrestle control of neighboring territories. This
100-year span between 1500 and 1600 is referred to as “Sengoku
Jidai” or, literally, “Age of Country at War.” It was a time of dis-
order. By the early 1600s, three extraordinary generals—
Nobunaga Oda, Hideyoshi Toyotomi, and Ieyasu Tokugawa—
had unified Japan over a 40-year period. Their prowess and
achievements are celebrated in Japanese history and folklore.
There is a Japanese saying: “Nobunaga piled the rice,
Hideyoshi kneaded the dough, and Tokugawa ate the cake.” In
other words, all three generals contributed to Japan’s unifica-
tion but Tokugawa, the last of these great generals, became the
Shogun whose family ruled Japan from 1615 to 1867. This era is
referred to as the Tokugawa Shogunate.

The military conditions that suffused Japan for centuries
became an integral part of candlestick terminology. If you think
about it, trading requires many of the same skills needed to win
a battle. Such skills include strategy, psychology, competition,
strategic withdrawals, and, yes, even luck. So it is not surpris-
ing that throughout this book you will come across candlestick
terms that are based on battlefield analogies. There are “night
and morning attacks,” the “advancing three soldiers pattern,”
“counterattack lines,” the “gravestone,” and so on.

The relative stability engendered by the centralized Japanese
feudal system led by Tokugawa offered new opportunities. The
agrarian economy grew, but more important, there was expan-
sion and ease in domestic trade. By the seventeenth century, a
national market had evolved to replace the system of local and
isolated markets. This concept of a centralized marketplace was
to lead indirectly to the development of technical analysis in
Japan.

Hideyoshi Toyotomi regarded Osaka as Japan’s capital and
encouraged its growth as a commercial center. Osaka’s easy
access to the sea, at a time where land travel was slow, danger-
ous, and costly, made it a national depot for assembling and
disbursing supplies. It evolved into Japan’s greatest city of

cy

Chapter 2 ¢ A Historical Background 17

commerce and finance. Its wealth and vast storehouses of sup-
plies provided Osaka with the appellation “the Kitchen of
Japan.”

Osaka contributed much to price stability by smoothing out
regional differences in supply. In Osaka, life was permeated by
the desire for profit (as opposed to other cities in which money
making was despised). The social system at that time was com-
posed of four classes. In descending order they were the
Soldier, the Farmer, the Artisan, and the Merchant. It took until
the 1700s for merchants to break down the social barrier. Even
today the traditional greeting in Osaka is “Mokarimakka”
which means, “Are you making a profit?”

In Osaka, Yodoya Keian became a war merchant for
Hideyoshi (one of the three great military unifiers). Yodoya had
extraordinary abilities in transporting, distributing, and setting
the price of rice. Yodoya’s front yard became so important that
the first rice exchange developed there. He became very
wealthy—as it turned out, too wealthy. The Bakufu (the mili-
tary government led by the Shogun) confiscated his entire for-
tune in 1705 on the charge that he was living in luxury not befit-
ting his social rank. The Bakufu was apprehensive about the
increasing amount of power acquired by certain merchants.
Certain officials and merchants tried to corner the rice market
in 1642. The punishment was severe: Their children were exe-
cuted, the merchants were exiled, and their wealth was confis-
cated.

The rice market that originally developed in Yodoya’s yard
was institutionalized when the Dojima Rice Exchange was set
up in the late 1600s in Osaka. The merchants at the Exchange
graded the rice and bargained to set its price. Up until 1710, the
Exchange dealt in actual rice. After 1710, the Rice Exchange
began to issue and accept rice warehouse receipts. These ware-
house receipts were called rice coupons. These rice receipts
became the first futures contracts ever traded.

Rice brokerage became the foundation of Osaka’s prosperity.
There were more than 1,300 rice dealers. Since there was no cur-
rency standard (the prior attempts at hard currency failed due
to the debasing of the coins), rice became the de facto medium
of exchange. A daimyo needing money would send his surplus
rice to Osaka where it would be placed in a warehouse in his


--- 第 31 页 ---

18

name. He would be given a coupon as a receipt for this rice. He
could sell this rice coupon whenever he pleased. Given the
financial problems of many daimyos, they would also often sell
rice coupons against their next rice tax delivery (taxes to the
daimyo were paid in rice—usually 40 to 60 percent of the rice
farmer’s crop). Sometimes the rice crop of several years hence
was mortgaged. These rice coupons were actively traded. The
rice coupons sold against future rice deliveries became the
world’s first futures contracts. The Dojima Rice Exchange,
where these coupons traded, became the world’s first futures
exchange. Rice coupons were also called “empty rice” coupons
(that is, rice that was not in physical possession). To give you an
idea of the popularity of rice futures trading, consider this: In
1749, there were a total of 110,000 bales (rice used to trade in
bales) of empty-rice coupons traded in Osaka. Yet, throughout
all of Japan there were only 30,000 bales of rice.”

Into this background steps Homma, called “god of the mar-
kets.” Munehisa Homma was born in 1724 into a wealthy fam-
ily. The Homma family was considered so wealthy that there
was a saying at that time, “I will never become a Homma, but
I would settle to be a local lord.” When Homma was given con-
trol of his family business in 1750, he began trading at his local
rice exchange in the port city of Sakata. Sakata was a collections
and distribution area for rice. Since Homma came from Sakata,
you will frequently come across the expression “Sakata’s
Rules” in Japanese candlestick literature. These refer to
Homma.

When Munehisa Homma’s father died, Munehisa was placed
in charge of managing the family’s assets. This was in spite of
the fact that he was the youngest son. (It was usually the eldest
son who inherited the power during that era.) This was proba-
bly because of Munehisa’s market savvy. With this money,
Homma went to Japan’s largest rice exchange, the Dojima Rice
Exchange in Osaka, and began trading rice futures.

Homma’s family had a huge rice farming estate. Their power
meant that information about the rice market was usually
available to them. In addition, Homma kept records of yearly
weather conditions. In order to learn about the psychology of
investors, Homma analyzed rice prices going back to the time
when the rice exchange was in Yodoya’s yard. Homma also set


--- 第 32 页 ---

up his own communications system. At prearranged times he
placed men on rooftops to send signals by flags. These men
stretched the distance from Osaka to Sakata. After dominating
the Osaka markets, Homma went to trade in the regional
exchange at Edo (now called Tokyo). He used his insights to
amass a huge fortune. It was said he had 100 consecutive win-
ning trades.

His prestige was such that there was the following folk song
from Edo: “When it is sunny in Sakata (Homma’s town), it is
cloudy in Dojima (the Dojima Rice Exchange in Osaka) and
rainy at Kuramae (the Kuramae exchange in Edo).” In other
words, when there is a good rice crop in Sakata, rice prices fall
on the Dojima Rice Exchange and collapse in Edo. This song
reflects Homma’s sway over the rice market. In later years
Homma became a financial consultant to the government and
was given the honored title of samurai. He died in 1803.
Homma’s books about the markets (Sakata Senho and Soba Sani
No Den) were said to have been written in the 1700s. His trad-
ing principles, as applied to the rice markets, evolved into the
candlestick methodology currently used in Japan.

Notes

1. His first name is sometimes translated as Sokyu and his last name is
sometimes translated as Honma. This gives you an idea of the difficulty
of translating Japanese into English. The same Japanese symbols for
Homma’s first name, depending on the translator, can be Sokyu or
Munehisa. His last name, again depending on the translator, can be either
Homma or Honma. I chose the English translation of Homma’s name as
used by the Nippon Technical Analysts Association.

DRAWING THE CANDLE LINES

The rectangular sections of the candle lines in Exhibits 3.4 to 3.6
are called the real body. The real body represents the range
between the session’s open and close. When the real body is
black (i.e., filled), it means the close of the session was lower
than the open. If the real body is white (i.e., empty), it shows
the close was higher than the open.

The thin lines above and below the real body are the shadows
(these names are almost lyrical—the real body and the shadows
of these real bodies.) These shadows represent the session's
price extremes. The shadow above the real body is called the
upper shadow and the shadow below the real body is the lower
shadow. Accordingly, the peak of the upper shadow is the high
of the session and the bottom of the lower shadow is the low of
the session.

If a candle line has no upper shadow, it is said to have a
shaven head. A candle line with no lower shadow has a shaven
bottom.

We see why these are named candle or candlestick charts; the
individual lines often look like candles with their wicks. As
mentioned in the Introduction, we will use the terms candles
and candlesticks interchangeably throughout the rest of the
book.

The Japanese say the real body is “the essence of the price
movement.” This reflects a central concept about the power of
the real bodies: By looking at the height and color of the real
body, we get an immediate visual clue whether it’s the bulls or
bears who are in control.

As such, candle charts will make market analysis faster and
more efficient. Using the long white candle in Exhibit 3.4 as an
example, who is in charge? The bulls or bears? Obviously, it’s
the bulls since on that session the market opened near its low
and closed near its high. Likewise, a long black candle (Exhibit
3.5) is a visual representation that, at least for that session, the
bears were in control since the market opened near its high and
closed near the session lows.

Candle lines can be drawn using any time frame—from
intraday to daily to weekly charts. For example, a white candle,
as shown in Exhibit 3.4, if based on a daily chart, would mean
that the bottom of the real body is the first trade of the day
(remember, a white real body signifies the open is at the bottom
of the real body) and the top of the real body is the day’s close.
The intraday peak and trough are the tip of the upper shadow
and the bottom of the lower shadow, respectively.

Similarly, a five-minute black candle line tells us that the
open of that five-minute period is at the top of the black real
body and the close is at its bottom. The high and low of that
five-minute session will define the upper and lower shadows.

A practical application of the real body is using its size as a
barometer of the market’s momentum.

While a long white and black candle shows the action is one-
sided, we get a clue that the prior momentum may be losing
force as the real body becomes smaller. The Japanese term for a
small real body (black or white) is a spinning top. Exhibit 3.6
shows examples of spinning tops. The lines illustrated in
Exhibit 3.6 have upper and lower shadows, but the sizes of the
shadows are not important. It is the small size of the real body
that makes these spinning tops.

Chapter 3 © Constructing the Candlestick Lines 27

Spinning tops are components of candle formations includ-
ing morning and evening stars, harami, hammers, and others
that will be discussed at length in the appropriate sections.

Notice something about the real bodies in Exhibit 3.7? There
aren’t any! These lines are named doji (the plural of doji is also
doji) and they represent a session when the open and close are
the same (or very close to one another). Doji have implications
as a reversal signal. We will look at this aspect later in this chap-
ter and in greater detail in Chapter 8.

In Exhibit 3.8, during the week of April 1 a descent began
near 315 via a series of black candles. As the decline ensued the
real bodies increased in length, reflecting increasing bearish
momentum. The emergence of the spinning top on April 7
changed the technical picture from one in which the bears had
complete control to a market where the bears were losing dom-
ination. Since the small real body was only one session’s activ-
ity, it should be viewed as a tentative clue. Nonetheless, it was
the first sign of a potential reversal. This represents a major
advantage of candle charts: They will often let you spot poten-
tial market turns as quickly as one session.

Part 1 ¢ The Basics

While the April 7 spinning top was a candle signal, it also
helped confirm a traditional western technical analysis tool—
specifically, a rising support line constructed by connecting the
March 10 and March 23 lows. Thus, we have two signals, the
support line and spinning top, reinforcing support near 285.
This concept of combining Eastern and Western techniques will
be the focus of Part 2.

Another example of a spinning top hinting of a turn is the
point where the decline from 315 began—the April 2 spinning
top (remember, the color of the small real body is not impor-
tant) that followed a tall white candle (at which time the bulls
were in control).

One of the fascinating aspects of the candles is that they can
send out warning signals not evident on bar charts. For example,
look at the prior chart in Exhibit 3.2 and the rally the week of
January 18. Notice the two candles lines as the stock approached
the $60 level. If this was a bar chart, this stock would look
healthy since it was making higher highs, higher lows, and even
higher closes. However, the candle lines give us a different per-
spective. To wit, those small real bodies are hinting that the bulls
do not have full control. Also, note that the high during the week
of January 18 was also near a resistance area. As such, the small
real bodies, via the candles, were confirming that resistance
area.!

As we've seen, the Japanese place great emphasis on the rela-
tionship between the open and close because they are the two
most emotionally charged points of the trading day. The
Japanese have a proverb: “The first hour of the morning is the
rudder of the day.” Likewise, the opening is the rudder for the
trading session. It furnishes the first clue about that day’s direc-
tion. It is a time when all the news and rumors from overnight
are filtered and then joined into one point in time.

The more anxious the trader, the earlier he or she wants to
trade. Therefore, on the open, shorts may be scrambling for
cover, potential longs may want to emphatically buy, hedgers
may need to take a new or get out of an old position, and so
forth.

After the flurry of activity on the open, potential buyers and
sellers now have a benchmark. There are frequent analogies to

trading the market and fighting a battle. In this sense, the open
provides an early view of the battlefield and a provisional indi-
cation of friendly and opposing troops.

The other pivotal price point is the close. We can thus expect
heavy emotional involvement into how the market closes. The
close is also a critical price point for many technicians. They
may wait for a close to confirm a breakout from a significant
chart point. Margin calls in the futures markets are also based
on the close. Many computer trading systems (for example,
moving average systems) are calculated from closes.

Typical of the military analogies used by candle chart analy-
sis is the way the Japanese refer to unusually big orders on the
open or close. If a large buy or sell order is pushed into the
market at or near the close, with the intention of affecting the
close, the Japanese call this action a “night attack.” If this is
done on the open, it is called, not surprisingly, a “morning
attack.”

CHAPTER 4
REVERSAL PATTERNS

— 56 Is Fe

Darkness lies one inch ahead.

chnicians watch for price clues alerting them to a shift in
market psychology and trend. Reversal patterns are these
technical clues. Western reversal indicators include double tops
and bottoms, reversal days, head and shoulders, and island
tops and bottoms. Yet the term “reversal pattern” is somewhat
of a misnomer. Hearing that term may lead you to think of an
old trend ending abruptly and then reversing to a new trend.
This rarely happens. Trend changes usually occur slowly, in
stages, as the underlying psychology shifts gears. A trend
reversal signal implies that the prior trend is likely to change,
but not necessarily reversing. Compare a trend to a car travel-
ing forward. The car’s red brake lights go on and the car stops.
The brake light was the reversal indicator showing that the

prior trend (that is, the car moving forward) was about to end.
But now that the car is stationary, will the driver then decide to
put the car in reverse? Will he or she remain stopped? Will he
or she decide to go forward again? Without more clues we do
not know.

Exhibits 4.1 through 4.3 are some examples of what can hap-
pen after a top reversal signal appears. The prior uptrend, for
instance, could convert into a period of sideways price action.
Then a new trend lower or higher could start (see Exhibits 4.1
and 4.2). Exhibit 4.3 illustrates how an uptrend can abruptly
reverse into a downtrend.

Remember that when I say “reversal pattern,” it means only
that the prior trend should change but not necessarily reverse.
It is prudent to think of reversal patterns as trend change pat-
terns. Recognizing the emergence of reversal patterns can be a
valuable skill. Successful trading entails having both the trend
and probability on your side. The reversal indicators are the
market’s way of providing a road sign, such as “Caution—
Trend in Process of Change.” In other words, the market’s psy-
chology is in transformation. You should adjust your trading
style to reflect the new market environment. There are many
ways to trade in and out of positions with reversal indicators.
We shall see many examples of this throughout the book.

An important principle is to initiate a new position (based on.
a reversal signal) only if that signal is in the direction of the
major trend. Let us say, for example, that in a bull market, a top
reversal pattern appears. This bearish signal would not warrant
a short sale. This is because the major trend is still up. It would,
however, signal a liquidation of longs. We could then look for a
bullish signal on the correction to buy since the prevailing
trend was higher.

I have gone into detail about the subject of reversal patterns
because most of the candle indicators are reversals. Now, let us
turn our attention to the first group of these candle reversal
indicators, the hammer and hanging man lines.

UMBRELLA LINES

lines in Exhibit 4.4 are called umbrella lines because they look
like umbrellas. Umbrella lines are candles with very long lower
shadows and a small real body at the top end of the range. |

These umbrella lines are fascinating in that these lines can be

that the downtrend should end. In such a scenario, this umbrel- Lines

la line is labeled a hammer, as in “the market is hammering out”

a base (see Exhibit 4.5). The actual Japanese word for the ham-

mer is takuri. This word means “trying to gauge the depth of | |

the hammer line as the market attempts to grope for a bottom. Io!

based on the prevailing trend before the umbrella line. We saw
that an umbrella line after a decline is a bullish signal called a
hammer. However, if either of the lines in Exhibit 4.4 emerges

after a rally, it is a potential top reversal signal ominously called | hn or Black

a hanging man (see Exhibit 4.6). The name “hanging man” is | | | |

derived from the fact that it looks like a hanging man with dan-

gling legs. |
It may seem unusual that the same candle line can be both Exhibit 4.6. Hanging Man

bullish and bearish. Yet, for those familiar with Western island

tops and bottoms, you will recognize that the identical idea

applies here. The island formation is either bullish or bearish

depending on where it is in a trend. An island after a prolonged

rising trend is bearish, while the same island pattern after a

falling trend is bullish.
To give a sense of the challenge of unraveling candle charting

techniques, one of the books I used for my research described

the umbrella lines in Exhibit 4.4 by saying, “buy from below

and sell from above.” What did that mean? Remember that I

did know about hammers and hanging man lines at the time I

read this. It took some time and some research to figure out that

the author meant that it’s bullish after a falling market (“buy

from below”) and potentially bearish after a rising market (“sell

from above”). The years of research required into unlocking

these “secrets of the Orient” were due to the fact that most of

the candle patterns and techniques were described in similarly
vague descriptions. It’s a good thing I like challenges!

The hammer and hanging man can be recognized by three
criteria:

1. The real body is at the upper end of the trading range. The
color of the real body is not important.

2. It has a long lower shadow that should be at least twice the
height of the real body.

3. It should have no, or a very short, upper shadow.
There are three aspects that differentiate the hanging man

from the hammer—trend, extent of the move before the candle
line, and confirmation. Specifically:

¢ Trend: A hammer must come after a decline. A hanging man
must come after a rally.

Extent of the move before the candle line: A hammer is valid even
if it comes after a short-term decline, but a hanging man
should emerge after an extended rally, preferably at an all-
time high.

Confirmation: As will be addressed later, a hanging man
should be confirmed, while a hammer need not be.

The longer the lower shadow, the shorter the upper shadow;
the smaller the real body, the more meaningful the bullish ham-
mer or bearish hanging man. We will now focus on the hammer
and then the hanging man.

Hammer

The real body of the hammer can be white or black. This is
because even if the real body of the hammer is black, we can see
in Exhibit 4.5 that it still closed near the session highs. We can
say it is slightly more bullish if the real body of the hammer is
white (because it closed at the high). The Japanese nickname for
a white hammer is a “power line.” In my experience, the suc-
cess of the hammer is not dependent on the color of its real
body.

The hammer’s long lower shadow and close at, or near, the
high of the session graphically relays that the market sold off

sharply during the session and then bounced back to close at,
or near, the session’s high. This could have bullish ramifica-
tions. This aspect of closing at or near the highs is why the
hammer should have no, or a minuscule, upper shadow. If
there was a long upper shadow, this would mean the market
closed well off its highs, which is an important criterion for the
hammer.

Since the hammer is a bottom reversal signal, we need a
falling trend to reverse.

In Exhibit 4.7 we see a hammer on February 24. It’s classic
because of its extended lower shadow and small real body at
the top end of the trading range. It also followed a decline. This
is a necessary condition for a hammer.

The line on February 22 would not be defined as a hammer
because it didn’t have the required lower shadow of two or
three times the height of the real body. Such a lower shadow is
necessary because it would display that the market had been
pushed down sharply lower during the session, but by the end
of the session, as the Japanese would say, there was a

“kamikaze fight” as the bears lost control as adduced by the
fact that the market closed at, or near, its session highs. This
was visually shown with a classic hammer on the 24th. You can
bet that after a day like this classic hammer, the bears are hav-
ing second thoughts.

Exhibit 4.7 brings out a vital aspect of candle charting.
Successful trading with candle charts requires an understand-
ing not only of the candle patterns, but also of where the can-
dle pattern appears and in the context of risk/reward analysis.
One should always consider the risk/reward aspect before
placing a trade based on a candle pattern or candle line. Let’s
look at the ideal hammer on the 24th keeping this aspect of
risk/reward in mind.

By the time the hammer was completed (remember, we have
to wait for the close), the stock closed near $48. Thus, if one
bought at the completion of a hammer (around $48), the risk
would be under the hammer’s lows of near $43. That is around
$5. We now have a $5 risk. There is nothing wrong with that if
your target is much greater than $5. However, for some active
traders $5 might be too large a risk.

As such, to help lower the potential risk of the trade, one
could wait for a correction to within the hammer’s lower shad-
ow (of course, there will be many times when the market will
not correct after the hammer). By using the hammer’s lows as a
potential purchase area, we have bought closer to the stop out
area.

Let’s imagine Trader A recognizes the hammer on February
24. He is so excited by this beautifully defined hammer that he
buys at the hammer’s close near $48. The next session, the mar-
ket gaps down to $44.50 on the opening. Trader A is now
underwater by $3.50. He may decide to exit the prior day’s long
position with a $4.50 loss. In such a scenario Trader A may have
said the candles did not work.

Trader B recognizes the hammer’s potential turning signal,
but remembering the aspect of risk/reward does not buy on the
hammer’s close (because the risk would be too much for her).
The next day, when the market opened lower, it was then near
a potential support area at the lower end of the long lower
shadow. Trader B recognizes the stock is now near potential

support and decides to buy. After the stock rallied from this
support area, Trader B would sing the praises of candles.

Of course, there will be times when a market fails to hold
potential support or resistance areas as well as they did with
this hammer. How you personally utilize the power of the can-
dle charts will be an important component of how successful
the candles turn out to be for you.

In the prior chart we saw how a hammer can become a
potential support. In Exhibit 4.8 we show how a hammer can
also be used to help confirm support. In this chart of the NAS-
DAQ-100 (NDX), there is a rally that started at area A. The first
sign that the ascent was slackening were the two small black
real bodies (at 1 and 2) near 3723. The market retreated steeply
from there. As it neared the potential support area near 3680
(support at A), a hammer formed. If the support is solid, the
hammer should then become a support, as it was for the next
two sessions. Of course, if the NDX had closed under the 3680
support area, our bullish outlook would have been voided.
That is an important aspect of technicals—there should always

be a price that says we are wrong. In this case it would have
been under 3680.

In Exhibit 4.9 we see a hammer with an extended lower shad-
ow whose diminutive real body is at the top end of the session.
We should note that a hammer can have a little upper shadow,
as is the case here. This hammer became a solid floor of sup-
port.

Hanging Man

The hanging man has the same shape as the hammer; the only
difference is that a hanging man comes after an advance (see
Exhibit 4.6). Because a long lower shadow is viewed as a plus,
and since the hanging man has such a shadow, it is especially
important that one wait for bearish confirmation with the
hanging man. At a minimum this would be a lower opening
under the real body of the hanging man. But I usually recom-
mend a close beneath the hanging man.


--- 第 50 页 ---

I

Chapter 4 © Reversal Patterns 39

The reason for waiting for a close under the hanging man’s
real body is that if the market closes lower the next day, those
who bought on the open or close of the hanging man day (and
lots of trading occurs at these two times) are now left “hang-
ing” with a losing position. This is why I would also like to
see the hanging man at an all-time high, or at least at a high
for a significant move. In this scenario the longs entering on
the hanging man session are in their position at new highs,
thus making them more nervous. Consequently, those longs
might decide to back out of their now losing position. That
could cascade into more selling pressure. Note how the sec-
ond small real body in Exhibit 4.8 (line 2) was a hanging man
whose bearish implications were confirmed by a lower close
the next session.

Exhibit 4.10 is an excellent example of how the same line can
be bearish (as in the hanging man line on January 29) or bullish
(the hammer on February 22). Although both the hanging man
and hammer in this example have white bodies, the color of the
real body is not of consequence.

The first line was a hanging man because the trend preceding
it was a rally. The hanging man was made at new highs for the
move. The next day (February 1) the market closed lower than
the hanging man’s real body, leaving all those new longs—who
bought on the hanging man’s open or close—in pain.

The line on February 22 was a hammer because it followed a
downtrend. The session before the hammer was a small real
body. This was an early clue that the bears’ drive was being
inhibited. The hammer was more bullish proof of this.

In Exhibit 4.11, on December 13, we see an upside breakout
from a short-term box range (the Japanese term for a lateral trad-
ing range). The rally from this breakout continued with three
extended white real bodies, each of which opened near its low
and closed at or near its highs. This underscored the bulls’
domination. Some cautionary signals emerged after the third
long white candle when a series of candles with upper shadows
arose. Note also what was happening with the slope of the
highs as we got these upper shadows. The slope from one high
to the next was decreasing (shown by the curving line). That

meant although new highs were still being made, the pace of
the rally was slackening.

The real hint that the bulls were losing control of the market
was with a hanging man session. Not only was this a hanging
man session, but it was also the first black real body and the
first spinning top of the rally. Confirmation of the hanging man
came at the next session’s close under the hanging man’s real
body. An attempt a couple days later to push the market high-
er stalled near $32 via a series of long upper shadows.

The descent from the hanging man at $32 lost bearish
momentum near $27. We were able to tell this by what hap-
pened after long black real bodies at A and B. Specifically, on
the day after each of these long black real bodies there was a
small real body. We would think that after each bearish session
at A and B, the market would continue lower the next session.
But it didn’t as shown by the spinning tops. This showed that
the bears, as shown by the two long black candles at A and B,
had tried to take control twice but on both occasions failed. This
probably gave the bears second thoughts about selling and
more encouragement for those thinking about buying.

Exhibit 4.12 highlights the importance of waiting for bearish
confirmation with a hanging man. Candle lines at 1, 2, and 3
were hanging man lines (their upper shadows were small
enough to keep them as hanging man lines). Each of these lines
made a new high close for the move and thus kept the bullish
momentum in force. To confirm the bearishness of any of these
hanging lines, and to convert the trend from up to less positive,
we would need a close under any of these hanging man real
bodies. That did not occur. Remember, anybody who bought on
the opening and closing of the hanging man session bought at
the highs of the move. If the market continues higher after the
hanging man session (as it did here), are these longs in pain? Of
course not. They’re happy because the market is higher than
where they bought. As such, as shown in this example, if the
market does not close under the hanging man’s real body, then
the bull trend remains entrenched.

THE ENGULFING PATTERN

The hammer and hanging man are individual candle lines. As
| | previously seen, single candle lines through the color, length,
| | | and size of the real bodies and the shadows can send important
| ' ( signals about the market's health. Most candle signals, howev-
er, are based on combinations of individual candle lines. The
engulfing pattern is the first of these multiple candle line pat-
terns. The engulfing pattern is a major reversal signal with two

opposite color real bodies composing this pattern.
Exhibit 4.13 shows a bullish engulfing pattern. The market is
falling. Then a white bullish real body wraps around, or

Engulfing Pattern


--- 第 54 页 ---

Exhibit 4.14 illustrates a bearish engulfing pattern. Here the

market is trending higher. A white real body engulfed by a
black real body is the signal for a top reversal. This shows that
supply has overwhelmed demand.

There are three criteria for an engulfing pattern:

. The market has to be in a clearly definable uptrend (for a

bearish engulfing pattern) or downtrend (for a bullish
engulfing pattern), even if the trend is short term.

. Two candles comprise the engulfing pattern. The second real

body must engulf the prior real body (it need not engulf the
shadows).

The second real body of the engulfing pattern should be the
opposite color of the first real body. (The exception to this
rule is if the first real body of the engulfing pattern is a doji.
Thus, after an extended fall, a doji engulfed by a very large
white real body could be a bottom reversal. In an uptrend, a
doji enveloped by a very large black real body could be a
bearish reversal pattern).

The closest Western analogy to the Japanese engulfing pat-

tern is the outside reversal session. In classic Western techni-
cals, this occurs when, during an uptrend (or downtrend), a
new high (or low) is made with prices closing under (or above)
the prior day’s close.

Some factors increasing the likelihood that an engulfing pat-

tern could be an important turning signal are: “‘

1.

If the first day of the engulfing pattern has a very small real
body (i.e., a spinning top) and the second day has a very long
real body. The small first real body candle reflects a dissipa-
tion of the prior trend’s force and the large second real body
proves an increase in force behind the new move.

. If the engulfing pattern appears after a protracted or very

fast move. A fast or extended move creates an overextended
market (either overbought or oversold) and makes it vulner-
able to profit taking.

. If there is heavy volume on the second real body of the

engulfing pattern. Volume will be discussed in Part 2.

Exhibit 4.15. Resistance for Bearish Engulfing Exhibit 4.16. Support for Bullish
Patterns Engulfing Patterns

A prime use of the engulfing pattern is utilizing them as sup-
port or resistance. This is illustrated in Exhibits 4.15 and 4.16. In
Exhibit 4.15 I use the high of the two candle lines that make the
bearish engulfing pattern. That high becomes our resistance
(based on a close). As shown in Exhibit 4.16, the same concept
is used for the bullish engulfing pattern. With that I have found
that the lowest low of that pattern should become support.

This technique of the bearish engulfing pattern as resistance
and support is especially useful if the market has moved too far
from the lows (with a bullish engulfing pattern) or highs (with
a bearish engulfing pattern) to be comfortable selling or buy-
ing. For example, by the time a bullish engulfing pattern is
completed (remember, we need to wait for the close of the sec-
ond session before we know it’s a bullish engulfing pattern),
the market may be well off its lows. As such, I would feel that
it has gotten away from an attractive buying area. In such a sce-
nario, we can wait for a possible correction to our support area
at the lows of the bullish engulfing pattern and then consider
stepping in from the long side. The same would be true, but in
reverse, for a bearish engulfing pattern.

In Exhibit 4.17 we see that the first white candle after six ses-
sions of black descending candles emerged early on May 5.
This white candle completed the bullish engulfing pattern. We
then use the low of the bullish engulfing pattern (the lowest
low of the two sessions that comprise the pattern) as support
near $56. Lucent rallied from this bullish engulfing pattern and
then stalled at a bearish engulfing pattern. Note how the high
of this bearish engulfing pattern became resistance the next ses-
sion. With the descent from this bearish engulfing pattern, a
doji sent a tentative clue that the stock was trying to stabilize
near the potential support at the bullish engulfing pattern. The
stock rallied from this successful test of the bullish engulfing

pattern’s support, hesitated for a few sessions at the bearish
engulfing pattern’s resistance, and then continued its ascent
along a rising support line. .

In Chapter 1, I addressed the significance of real bodies, but
shadows should be a pivotal part of your analysis. We look at an
example of this aspect in Exhibit 4.18.1 A series of long upper
shadows—otherwise known as bearish shadows—arose during
the weeks of November 2 and 16. These long upper shadows
sent a strong visual clue that the market was rejecting the 1.1850
area. The decline that began after the second set of long upper
shadows ended with a hammer (a candle with an extended
lower shadow—another example of the shadow’s significance).
A few days after the hammer, the stock pulled back via a long
black real body (that marginally broke the hammer’s support).
The next day a tall white candle completed a bullish engulfing
pattern. The rally that began from the bullish engulfing pattern
terminated at the doji at 1.1950. Note how the doji confirmed a
resistance area defined by the late October’s series of long upper

shadows. Remembering the concept of the bullish engulfing
pattern as potential support, we look to the November 27 and 28
bullish engulfing pattern near 1.1470 as support. A successful
test at this area occurred the week of January 11.

A major low in crude oil came with a classic bullish engulf-
ing pattern as shown in Exhibit 4.19. This was a classic pattern
insofar as the first real body was a small black real body (this
showed the bears were losing a foothold) and the second can-
dle was a vibrant long white real body that opened on its low
and closed near its high. What was so significant about this par-
ticular bullish engulfing pattern was that the white real body
engulfed not only one black real body, but three black real bod-
ies. Keep in mind that while this clearly showed the bulls had
taken full control from the bears, it does not signify the extent
of the move following the bullish engulfing pattern. Candles,
while unexceiled at sending out early reversal signals, do not
provide price targets. This is why Western technicals are so
important, as they can be used to help forecast price targets.
This is an aspect we will look at in Part 2.

In Exhibit 4.20 a rally that began at area A hesitated for a few
sessions in late March near $43.50 with some long upper shad-
ows and a doji. With a push over this five-day resistance area,
as the Japanese would say, “The dirt was blown away.” The
rally resumed in earnest until it was short-circuited at the bear-
ish engulfing pattern on April 13 and 14. Note the extreme size
of the black real body of that pattern. This underscored how the
bears had wrested control of the market from the bulls. This
bearish engulfing pattern was confirmed as resistance a few
weeks later with the emergence of another bearish engulfing
pattern. This echoed the fact that each time the bulls were able
to propel the stock toward $51.50, they couldn’t hold control of
the market.

Let’s look at these two bearish engulfing patterns and com-
pare them to a Western outside reversal session. In a Western
outside reversal session (I'll focus on a top outside reversal ses-
sion), the market makes a new high for the move and then clos-
es the next day under the previous day’s close. The first bearish
engulfing pattern, if in bar chart form, would also be a tradi-
tional Western outside reversal day since the stock made a new
high for the move with the top of the black candle session and
then closed under the prior day’s close.

Now, let’s look at the second bearish engulfing pattern in late
April. Note how the second candle in that bearish engulfing
pattern failed to obtain a new high (its high was $51 and the
prior session’s high was $51.75). Consequently, if this was a tra-
ditional bar chart, it would not have been a reversal signal via
an outside reversal session (since it didn’t make a new high).
But with a candle chart, all that is needed for the bearish
engulfing pattern is for a black real body to wrap around a
white real body, which is what happened in this instance. This
is a good example of how the candles will provide a timing
advantage on those who just use traditional bar chart analysis.

In Exhibit 4.21 a bearish engulfing pattern in early July took
the force out of the preceding rally. This bearish engulfing pat-
tern became resistance for the next week and a half. Once Cisco
closed over the highs of this bearish engulfing pattern on July 15,
it was a bullish breakout (even though it was a doji, the fact that
it was a new high close is a positive). For those who are momen-
tum players, the break above a bearish engulfing pattern could

be viewed as an indication of a new upleg and a time to consid-
er buying. To confirm a breakout, I recommend waiting for a
close over that resistance area, not just in intraday break. Another
bearish engulfing pattern was completed on July 21 became
resistance that was tested in late August. Notice as prices
approached the bearish engulfing pattern’s resistance area, a
group of small real bodies reflected hesitation.

DARK-CLOUD COVER

Our next reversal pattern is the dark-cloud cover (see Exhibit. 9 .u-- resistance

uptrend or, at times, at the top of a congestion band. The first | i
day of this two-candle pattern is a strong white real body. The [I

THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTIVE STOPS

One of the more powerful aspects of technical analysis is that it can be
used as a mechanism for a risk and money management approach to
trading. Defining risk means. using. protective stops to help protect
against unanticipated adverse price movements.

A stop should be placed at the time of the original trade, since this
is when one. is most ‘objective. Stay in the position only if the market
performs according to expectations. If subsequent price action either
contradicts or fails to confirm these expectations, it is time to exit. If

Thus, you stubbornly. stay with the position in the hope the market will

lowing the dark-cloud cover. In some circumstances I will also
view it as a dark-cloud cover even if the open is over the prior
session’s close instead of the prior session’s high.

The rationale behind this bearish pattern is readily
explained. On the first session of the dark-cloud cover, the mar-
ket is ascending with a strong white candle. This is followed by
a gap higher on the next session’s opening. Thus far, the bulls
are in complete control. But then the whole technical picture
changes as, on the second day of this pattern, the market clos-
es not only beneath the prior close, but well within the prior
day’s real body, offsetting much of the gain of the first session.
In such a scenario, the longs will have second thoughts about
their position. Those who were waiting for selling short now
have a benchmark to place a stop—at the new high of the sec-
ond day of the dark-cloud cover pattern.

Some factors intensifying the importance of dark-cloud cov-
ers include:

1. The greater the penetration of the black real body’s close into
the prior white real body, the greater the chance for a top. (If
the black real body covers the prior day’s entire white body,
it would be a bearish engulfing pattern rather than a dark-
cloud cover.) Think of the dark-cloud cover as a partial solar
eclipse blocking out part of the sun (that is, covers only part
of the prior white body). The bearish engulfing pattern can
be viewed as a total solar eclipse blocking out the entire sun
(that is, covers the entire white body). A bearish engulfing
pattern, consequently, can be a more meaningful top rever-
sal. If a long white real body closes above the highs of the
dark-cloud cover, or the bearish engulfing pattern it could
presage another rally.

2. During a prolonged ascent, if there is a strong white day that
opens on its low (that is, a shaven bottom) and closes on its
high (that is, a shaven head) and the next day reveals a long
black real body day, opening on its high and closing on its
low, then a shaven head and shaven bottom black day has
occurred.

3. If the second body (that is, the black body) of the dark-cloud
cover opens above a major resistance level and then fails, it

would prove the bulls were unable to take control of the mar-
ket.

4. If, on the opening of the second day, there is very heavy vol-
ume, then a buying blow off could have occurred. For exam-
ple, heavy volume at a new opening high could mean that
many new buyers have decided to jump aboard ship. Then
the market sells off. It probably won’t be too long before this
multitude of new longs (and old longs who have ridden the
uptrend) realize that the ship they jumped onto is the Titanic.
For futures traders, very high opening interest can be anoth-
er warning.

Just as a bearish engulfing pattern can be resistance, so too
the highest high of the two sessions that formed the dark-cloud
cover should be resistance. This is shown in Exhibit 4.22.

A dark-cloud cover in Exhibit 4.23 stopped a rally. The day
after this pattern, Intel pushed up and failed near the high of
this pattern near $71. The stock stalled again near $71 a week
and then two weeks later. Observe how Intel poked its head
above the resistance line on January 20, but the failure to close
over the resistance keeps resistance intact.

Exhibit 4.24. Wolverine Tube—Daily (Dark-Cloud Cover)

In Exhibit 4.24 we see a rally that began mid August. On
August 22 the stock gapped higher and formed a hanging man
session, but its potential bearish implications were not con-
firmed the next session since the next day’s close was over the
hanging man’s real body. The stock had a final push with a gap
higher opening on August 28 at $43.25. On that opening it
looked fine from the bulls’ perspective. It closed down at $40.62
by the end of that session. This completed a dark-cloud cover
since the black candle pulled well into the prior session’s white
real body.

While this was a well-defined dark-cloud cover, from a
risk-reward perspective it may not have been a good place to
sell. This is because the dark-cloud cover was finalized on the
close of the second day of the pattern, and by then it was well
off its highs. Using the concept of the dark-cloud cover as
potential resistance, one could wait for a bounce to near the
dark-cloud cover to sell (assuming this occurs). In early
October a rally to the high of the dark-cloud cover showed
signs of running out of steam with a small black real body and

the same highs for four consecutive sessions at $43.25. The
decline from early October ended with a hammer that con-
firmed a late September support area.

Dual bullish engulfing patterns at 1 and 2 in Exhibit 4.25
underscored the solidity of support in the 3275/3250 area. The
rally from the second bullish engulfing pattern hesitated at the
dark-cloud cover. Immediately after this pattern, a white real
body marginally penetrated the dark-cloud cover’s resistance
(shown at the horizontal line). While not a decisive breakout, it
was a close above resistance and as such a positive signal.

Exhibit 4.25 reflects the importance of adapting to changing
market conditions. To wit, the breakout above resistance at the
first dark-cloud cover puts the trend higher, but the next session
our market view changes from positive to a more cautionary
one. Why? Because the day after the breakout a black candle
completed another dark-cloud cover. This second black candle
reflected an inability by the bulls to hold the new highs.

Chapter 4 ¢ Reversal Patterns 55
PIERCING PATTERN

As is true with most candle patterns, for each bearish pattern
there is an opposite bullish pattern. So it is with the bearish
dark-cloud cover. The dark-cloud cover’s counterpart is the
bullish piercing pattern (see Exhibit 4.26). The piercing pattern is
composed of two candles in a falling market. The first candle is
a black real body day and the second is a white real body. This
white candle opens lower, ideally under the low of the prior
black day. Then prices rebound to push well into the black can-
dle’s real body.

The piercing pattern is akin to the bullish engulfing pattern.
In the bullish engulfing pattern, the white real body engulfs the
entire previous black real body. For the piercing pattern, the |
white real body pierces, but does not wrap around, the prior ;
black body. In the piercing pattern, the greater the degree of
penetration into the black real body, the more likely it will |
become a bottom reversal. An ideal piercing pattern will have a 0
white real body that pushes more than halfway into the prior ly
session’s black real body. The psychology behind the piercing Exhibit 4.27. On-Neck
pattern is as follows: The market is in a downtrend. The bear- Pattern
ish black real body reinforces this view. The next session the
market opens lower via a gap. The bears are watching the mar-
ket with contentment. Then the market surges toward the close, |
managing not only to close unchanged from the prior day’s |
close, but sharply above that close. The bears will be second- |
guessing their position. Those who are looking to buy would (
say new lows could not hold and could view it as an opportu- i
nity to buy. |

The piercing pattern signal increases in importance based on Exhibit 4.28. In-Neck
the same factors 1 through 4 as with the dark-cloud cover, but Pattern
in reverse. (See previous section.) With the dark-cloud cover we
would like to see the black real body closing more than midway \
in the prior white candlestick. But there is some flexibility to
this rule. There is less flexibility with the piercing pattern. The |
piercing pattern’s white candlestick should push more than
halfway into the black candlestick’s real body. The reason for
less latitude with the bullish piercing pattern than with the |
bearish dark-cloud cover pattern is the fact that the Japanese Exhibit 4.29. Thrusting
have three other patterns called the on-neck, the in-neck, and the Pattern

thrusting pattern (see Exhibits 4.27 to 4.29). They have the same
basic formation as the piercing pattern. The difference among
them is in the degree of penetration by the white candle into the
black candle’s real body. The on-neck pattern’s white candle
(usually a small one) closes near the low of the previous ses-
sion. The in-neck pattern’s white candle closes slightly into the
prior real body (it should also be a small white candle). The
thrusting pattern should be a longer white candle that is
stronger than the in-neck pattern, but still does not close above
the middle of the prior black real body.

It’s not important to remember the individual patterns in
Exhibits 4.27 to 4.29. Instead, just remember the concept that
the white candle should push more than halfway into the black
candle’s real body to send out a more potent bottom reversal
signal.

Aseries of long lower shadows shown in Exhibit 4.30 at areas
1 and 2 denoted potential support near $56. But on September
8 Dayton-Hudson pummeled through this support as it opened
near $54. The bears had gained control—or so they thought. By
the end of September 8, the bulls had successfully propelled the

stock to well above the prior session’s close. The candle lines of
September 7 and 8 built a piercing pattern. A week after the
piercing pattern, a hammer on September 16 reinforced the pat-
tern’s support near $54. More confirmation emerged the week
after the hammer with a series of long lower shadows.

A rally that started from a bullish engulfing pattern in mid
March in Exhibit 4.31 displayed a hint of trouble with the
March 24 spinning top near $59. A close over $59 on April 3
with a long white real body put the bulls back in charge, at least
until the next session. On this session (April 4) the stock formed
a variation of a dark-cloud cover. It was a variation of the dark-
cloud cover because with that pattern we like to see an open on
the second day above the prior session’s high. In this case, the
open was above the prior day’s close. Nonetheless, since the
black candle on April 4 pulled so deeply into the white candle’s
real body, it increased the likelihood that this would be as effec-
tive as a more traditional dark-cloud cover.

The piercing pattern on April 17 and 18 presaged a rally. The
rally from this piercing pattern continued until another dark-
cloud cover on April 24 and 25. This second dark-cloud cover

could also be viewed as a variation of a classic dark-cloud
cover. Why? Because the black real body did not push more
than halfway into the white real body. Once again, while this
wasn’t a classic dark-cloud cover, there were two factors that
led me to believe it was just as negative as a traditional dark-
cloud cover. Specifically, (1) the black candle on April 25
opened sharply above the prior day’s high and then closed
under the prior day’s close, and (2) this pattern was also a fail-
ure, and hence confirmation of resistance at the early April
dark-cloud cover.

This chart highlights the general concept that one should
view a non-ideal candle pattern by (1) how it was formed and
(2) within the overall market picture. These two factors will
help us gauge if the less-than-perfect pattern could have the
same implications as a more classicly defined candle pattern. It
is this subjectivity that makes computer recognition of candle
patterns so difficult. For example, the two dark-cloud covers
discussed in this exhibit did not meet the classic definition of
the dark-cloud cover, but I viewed them as dark-cloud covers

because of how and where they were formed, as discussed in
the prior paragraph.

With a piercing pattern that doesn’t push deeply into the
prior black candle, I usually suggest waiting for confirmation
with a higher close the session after the white candle. In Exhibit
4.32, late in the morning of March 31, a white candle pushed
into the black candle. Since it did not close above the middle
black candle, it wasn’t a piercing pattern. It was a thrusting pat-
tern. The higher close the session after this thrusting pattern
helped reinforce that this could be a bottoming signal. Late in
the session of March 31 another thrusting pattern was formed
near $117. Normally with a thrusting pattern (as we saw earli-
er that day) one should wait for some bullish confirmation. But
with this second thrusting pattern, because it confirmed a prior
support area, one would need less bullish confirmation (i.e.,
less reason to wait for higher close the next session). As such,
for active momentum traders, the close of the white candle of
the second thrusting pattern could have been used as a buying
opportunity. An exit signal was given with the bearish engulf-
ing pattern early the next morning.

CHAPTER 5
STARS

FAA (2 B@ & Id Hv

One cannot be too cautious.

ne group of fascinating reversal patterns is those that
include stars. A star is a small real body (white or black)
that gaps away from the large real body preceding it (see
Exhibit 5.1). In other words, the star’s real body can be within
the prior session’s upper shadow; all that is needed is that the
real bodies don’t overlap (there are some exceptions to this
rule, which are addressed later in this section). If the star is a
doji instead of a small real body, it is called a doji star (Exhibit
5.2). The star, especially the doji star, is a warning that the prior
trend may be ending.
The star’s small real body represents a stalemate between the
bulls and bears. The bulls are obviously in charge in a briskly

ascending market. With the emergence of a star in such an envi-
ronment, it is a signal of a shift from the buyers being in control
to a deadlock between the buying and selling forces. This dead-
lock may have occurred either because of a diminution in the
buying force or an increase in the selling pressure. Either way,
the star tells us the rally’s prior power has slightly dissipated.
This means the market is vulnerable to a setback.

The same is true, but in reverse, for a star in a downtrend
(sometimes a star during a downtrend is labeled a raindrop).
The long black candle during the downtrend visually reflects
that the bears are in command. A change is seen in the advent
of the star, which signals an environment in which the bulls
and the bears are more in equilibrium. In other words, the
downward energy has thus been cooled. This is not a favorable
scenario for a continuation of the bear market.

The star is part of four reversal patterns including:

1. the morning star;
2. the evening star;

3. the doji stars; and
4. the shooting star.

THE MORNING STAR

The morning star (Exhibit 5.3) is a bottom reversal pattern. Its
name is derived because, like the morning star (the nickname
for the planet Mercury) that foretells the sunrise, it presages
higher prices. There are three candle lines comprising this pat-
tern:

Candle 1. An extended black real body. This pictorially proves
that the bears are in command.

Candle 2. A small real body that doesn’t touch the prior real
body (these two lines comprise a basic star pattern). The
small real body means sellers are losing the capacity to drive
the market lower.

Candle 3. The concluding candle of the morning star is a
white real body that intrudes deeply into the first session’s

black candle. This is the indication that the bulls have seized
control.

The lowest low of the three lines that form this pattern
should be support as shown by the dashed line in Exhibit 5.3.

An ideal morning star would have a gap between the second
and third real bodies. From my experience, a lack of a gap does
not seem to weaken the power of this formation. The decisive
factor is that the second candle should be a spinning top and
the third candle pushes well into the black candle.

Exhibit 5.4 is an example of this. In late July /early August we
see three candle lines that make up the requisite criteria of a
morning star: a long black candle, a small real body, and then a
tall white candle. Of course, this pattern has to follow a decline.
An aspect that kept this from an ideal morning star pattern was
that the third real body wrapped around the second candle.
However, from my experience, even if the second and third
candles overlap, it doesn’t mitigate the effectiveness of this pat-
tern. In fact, the second and third lines of this morning star pat-
tern created a bullish engulfing pattern.

This chart is also a good example of how candle charts will
frequently give turning signals before the more traditional sig-
nals derived from a bar chart. A bear channel that began in
February remained in force until the third quarter that year.
The close over the top of the bear channel was the traditional
Western signal that the downtrend had been broken. By using
the light of the candles (via the morning star), we had obtained
an early warning beacon of a turn many sessions prior to the
break over the bear channel.

A limitation with the morning star is that since this is a
three-candle pattern, one has to wait until the close of the
third session to complete the pattern. As is usually the case, if
this third candle is a tall white one, we would get the signal
well after the market already had a sharp bounce. In other
words, the completion of the morning star may not present an
attractive risk/reward trading opportunity. An option is wait-
ing for a correction to the morning star’s support area to start
nibbling from the long side. As shown in Exhibit 5.5, there
was a morning star in early February. If one bought on the
completion of this pattern near $74, by the next day he or she
would have had a loss. By waiting for a correction to any-
where near the low of the morning star (toward $65.50) before
buying, a trader would decrease his or her risk since the stop
would be under the low of the morning star. As this stock
ascended, it did so along a rising support line. (Trend lines are
the focus of Chapter 11.)

While the ideal morning and evening stars should have none
of their three real bodies touching, there is even more flexibili-
ty to the definition of the morning star (and also the evening
star) in markets where the open and close are either the same or
close to one another. This would include:

1. Foreign exchange markets where there is no official open and
close.

2. Many indexes such as the Semi-Conductor or Drug Indexes.

3. Intraday charts. For instance, on a 15-minute chart the open
of a 15-minute session is usually not much different from the
close of the prior 15-minute session.

EXHIBIT 5.5. Merrill Lynch—Daily (Morning Star)

Let’s use the intraday chart in Exhibit 5.6 to see an instance
of the value of being flexible in interpreting the candle patterns.
Mid-day on December 27 the index made a new low for the
move and in doing so broke under the support from early that
day of 3535/3530. The bears thus took control. But at 13:00 a
small real body and the next session’s long white candle made
a morning star. Notice how all three bodies touched one anoth-
er (the open of the second candle was the same as the close of
the first candle and the open of the third candle was the same
as the close of the second session). Because this was an intraday
chart where the open/close difference is usually minor, I still
viewed this as a viable morning star. This pattern took on more
credibility since the third candle, which finalized this pattern,
also pushed the index back above the previously broken sup-
port area near 3530. When a market makes a new low and the
bears can’t maintain these new lows, it is frequently a hint of a
reversal.

THE EVENING STAR

The evening star is the bearish counterpart of the morning star
pattern. It is aptly named because the evening star (the nick-
name for the planet Venus) appears just before darkness sets in.
Since the evening star is a top reversal, it should be acted upon
if it arises after an uptrend. Three lines compose the evening
star (see Exhibit 5.7). The first is a long white real body, the next
is a star. The star is the first hint of a top. The third line corrob-
orates a top and completes the three-line pattern of the evening
star. The third line is a black real body that closes sharply into
the first period’s white real body. I like to compare the evening
star pattern to a traffic light. The traffic light goes from green
(the bullish white real body) to yellow (the star’s warning sig-
nal) to red (the black real body confirming the prior trend has
stopped).

In principle, an evening star should have a gap between the
first and second real bodies and then another gap between the
second and third real bodies. But, as detailed earlier in the sec-
tion on the morning star, this second gap is rarely seen and is


--- 第 77 页 ---

not necessary for the success of this pattern. The main concern
should be the extent of the intrusion of the third day’s black
real body into the first day’s white real body.

At first glance Exhibit 5.7 is like an island top reversal as
used by Western technicians. Analyzing the evening star more
closely shows it furnishes a reversal signal not available with
an island top (see Exhibit 5.8). For an island top, the low of ses-
sion 2 has to be above the highs of sessions 1 and 3. However,
the ideal evening star only requires real body 2 to be above the
high of real bodies 1 and 3 to be a reversal signal.

Some factors increasing the likelihood that an evening or
morning star could be a reversal would include:

1. If there is no overlap among the first, second, and third real
bodies.

2. If the third candle closes deeply into the first candle’s real
body.

3. If there is light volume on the first candle session and heavy
volume on the third candle session. This would show a
reduction of the force for the prior trend and an increase in
the direction force of the new trend.

The highs of the evening star become resistance as displayed
by the dashed line shown in Exhibit 5.7.

Let’s look at Exhibit 5.9. A classic evening star was complet-
ed in early January. This evening star had the ideal prerequisite
of the three real bodies not intersecting. Intersecting the star
portion (that is, the second candle line of the evening star pat-
tern) was a hanging man line whose bearish confirmation came
the next day. The descent from the evening star culminated a
week later near 1210 at area A. The rally from A hesitated a
week later via a doji near the resistance area created by the
evening star. This doji hinted the rally was exhausting itself.
(Dojis are discussed in Chapter 8.)

The next time the market rallied to this resistance in the first
week of February, it formed a bearish engulfing pattern at B. I
mention this bearish engulfing pattern to bring out the impor-
tance of trend in helping to define a candle pattern. I have dis-
cussed how a bearish engulfing pattern is when a black real body
engulfs a white real body. There was a black real body at A that

wrapped around a prior white candle. Was this a bearish engulf-
ing pattern? No, because it came after a price decline; whereas a
bearish engulfing, as a top reversal, needs a rally to reverse. This
is why I define B as a bearish engulfing pattern, but not A.

Another doji in late February echoed continued supply near
the evening star’s resistance level. The long black candle after
this doji formed another evening star pattern. This evening star
had a doji as a second candle line instead of a spinning top. This
is a special type of evening star called an evening doji star, which
is discussed later in this section. The second evening star is an
example where the second and third candles overlapped. From
my experience this works as well as the more classic pattern in
which none of the real bodies touch.

A challenge with some of the candle patterns is that by the
time the pattern is completed, the market may be well off its
highs or lows. The evening star, because of the need to wait for


--- 第 79 页 ---

its completion with a long black real body, may give a reversal
signal well after the market has already turned. We look at this
aspect in Exhibit 5.10.

As shown in this chart, the high of the move was near $34,
with the evening star’s completion on the close of the third ses-
sion at $31. As such, if one sold based on the evening star at $31,
the risk would be to the high of evening star toward $34. There
is no problem with a $3 risk if the target is many times that risk.
Only then would it be an attractive risk/reward trade.

If this $3 risk is too large, one can improve the risk/reward
aspect of this trade by waiting for a bounce to near the resis-
tance area at the top of the evening star (of course, there is no
guarantee of a bounce). In this example, two sessions after the
evening star we got a $2 rebound which took the stock very
close to its pivotal resistance at $34. After this stock resumed
its decline, it moved into the April-May period. The shrinking
real bodies presaged that chances for a turnaround had
increased.

THE MORNING AND EVENING DOJI STARS

An evening star that has a doji instead of a small real body as
the second candle is called an evening doji star (see Exhibit 5.11).
The evening doji star is a distinctive form of the regular
evening star. We saw an example of this pattern in Exhibit 5.9.

A morning star that has a doji as the star portion (i.e., the
middle candle of the three candle lines) is a morning doji star
(see Exhibit 5.12). This type of morning star can be a meaning-
ful bottom.

If there is an evening doji star in which the bottom shadow of
the doji session does not overlap with the shadows of the first
or third candles (that is, the shadows do not touch), it is con-
sidered a top reversal signal known as an abandoned baby top
(see Exhibit 5.13). This pattern is very rare.

The same is true, only in reverse, for a bottom. Specifically, if
there is a doji that has a gap before and after it (where the shad-
ows do not touch), it should be a bottom. This pattern is referred
to as an abandoned baby bottom (see Exhibit 5.14). It is also


--- 第 81 页 ---

extremely rare. To give an idea on the rarity of this pattern, con-
sider that the abandoned baby is the same as a Western island
top or bottom where the island session would be a doji.

Because the middle line of the morning star in Exhibit 5.15
was a doji, this is an example of a morning doji star. Here we
see how the third candle line slightly overlapped the second
real body (i.e., doji line). The ascent from this morning doji star
ran out of force with the series of spinning tops (a.k.a. small real
bodies). As is the case with the traditional morning star, the
lowest low of the morning doji star (in this case near $92)
should act as a base on pullbacks. That is what happened in
mid October as the morning doji star held its ground as sup-
port. The doji portion of the morning star had long upper and
lower shadows. This further reflects that the market is losing its
prior directional bias (which in this example was down). This
doji, called a long-legged doji, is discussed in Chapter 8.

An evening doji star is shown in Exhibit 5.16. Ideally, I would
have liked to see the last black candle of this pattern close more
into the white real body of the first session. However, the fact

mark” is a round $100 figure that can become support or resis-
tance) and then the failure to push over the resistance area of
this pattern a few days later (via a long upper shadow candle)
helped substantiate this as an evening doji star. This $400 level
remained an upside barrier over the next few weeks with the
long black real body on November 30 providing the “death
blow” in forming a bearish engulfing pattern.

In Exhibit 5.17 an evening doji star pattern formed in late
February. Because the market gapped before and then after the
doji, this pattern was an abandoned baby top. Also troubling
about this particular scenario was the third day’s abandoned
baby (gapped down). This showed the prior day’s new high
close above $56 could not be sustained. When a new high is
made and the bulls can’t maintain the new highs, it often had
bearish consequences. This is discussed in Chapter 11.

The ideal abandoned baby bottom has a doji as the second
real body. In Exhibit 5.18 there was a diminutive real body as
the second session instead of the requisite doji needed for the
ideal abandoned baby. However, the real body was so small

that it could be viewed as a doji and thus a variation of this pat-
tern (this second session was also a hammer). The advance
from this bottom reversal persisted until a series of longer
upper shadows (at the arrows) alerted us that the bulls were
not calling all the shots. This further buttressed the outlook that
the market had hit a ceiling. A rebound commenced after the
bullish engulfing pattern of April 6 and 7.

THE SHOOTING STAR AND
THE INVERTED HAMMER

As shown in Exhibit 5.19, the shooting star has a small real body
at the lower end of its range with a long upper shadow. We can
see how this line’s name is derived. It looks like a shooting star
with its long tail blazing across the sky. The Japanese aptly say
that the shooting star shows trouble overhead. Since it is one
session, it is usually not a major reversal signal as is the bearish
engulfing pattern or evening star. Nor do I view the shooting
star as pivotal resistance as I do with the two previously men-
tioned patterns.

As with all stars, the color of the real body is not important.
The shooting star pictorially tells us that the market opened
near its low, then strongly rallied and finally backed off to close
near the opening. In other words, that session’s rally could not
be sustained.

Since the shooting star is a bearish reversal signal, it must
come after a rally. An ideal shooting star has a real body that
gaps away from the prior real body. Nonetheless, as will be
seen in several chart examples, this gap is not always necessary.
A lack of a rising gap is more of a reason to be negative on the
shooting star. This is because, as addressed in Chapter 7, an
ascending gap, called a “rising window” in Japan, is a positive
signal. As such, I am more comfortable saying the trend could
be turning less bullish if the shooting star has no gap. If a shoot-
ing star-shaped candle line comes after a downturn, it could be
a bullish signal. Such a line is called an inverted hammer. The
inverted hammer line is discussed later in this chapter.

The Shooting Star

If Exhibit 5.20 were formed as a bar chart instead of a candle
chart, sessions A, B, and C would reflect a healthy environment
because they each had higher highs, higher lows, and higher
closes. But from a candle charting perspective, we get visual
warnings with these sessions of trouble overhead. Specifically,
the bearish upper shadows at A, B, and C strongly indicate a
stock that is, as the Japanese say, “rising in agony.” Final con-
firmation of a top came at session C, the shooting star. You may
have noticed that a gravestone doji looks like a shooting star.
The gravestone doji is a specific version of a shooting star. The
shooting star has a small real body but the gravestone doji—
being a doji—has no real body. The gravestone doji is thus more
bearish than a shooting star.

In Exhibit 5.21, the first shooting star—in what was to be a
series of shooting stars—arose on March 10 at $34.50. A few
weeks later, three consecutive shooting stars appeared at this

same $34.50 level. This told us that try as they might, each time
the bulls had been able to push the stock up to $34.50, they
couldn’t sustain these intraday highs into the close. In other
words, the shooting stars were visually showing us that the
market was rejecting higher prices. When, as in this example,
we get signal after signal at the same price level, it reinforces
that resistance area. In this case the confluence of shooting stars
dramatically increased the likelihood that this would be a
reversal. Of course, if the bulls had enough force to close this
stock over the highs of the shooting stars, then we would
reassess any bearish views.

A shooting star early on August 22 in Exhibit 5.22 reinforced
trouble near $304 since it was the third consecutive session that
failed there. The 30-minute period following the shooting star
gave more proof of a top since it produced a bearish engulfing
pattern. Corning then settled into a box range defined by the
support of the hammer at $294 from late on August 23 (which
was successfully defended with another hammer early the next

day). The rally from the second hammer at $294 hit a ceiling
with the shooting star’s resistance near $304.

The Inverted Hammer

While not a star pattern, I want to discuss the inverted hammer
in this section because of its resemblance to the shooting star.
Exhibit 5.23 demonstrates how an inverted hammer has the
same form as a shooting star with its long upper shadow and
small real body at the lower end of the range. The only differ-
ence between the shooting star and inverted hammer is that the
inverted hammer comes after a decline. As a result, while the
shooting star is a top reversal line, the inverted hammer is a
bottom reversal line. The color of the inverted hammer’s real
body doesn’t matter. This is similar in concept to the hammer
and hanging man concept (see Chapter 4) in which the same
shape line is bullish or bearish depending on the preceding
trend.

Just as a hanging man needs bearish confirmation, the invert-
ed hammer needs bullish confirmation. This confirmation
could be in the form of the next day opening above the invert-
ed hammer’s real body or especially a close the next day over
the inverted hammer’s real body.

The reason for the required bullish verification of the invert-
ed hammer is because its long upper shadow gives the invert-
ed hammer a bearish hue. To wit, on the inverted hammer ses-
sion the market opens on, or near, its low and then rallies. The
bulls fail to sustain the rally and prices close at, or near, the
lows of the session. Why should negative action like this be a
potentially bullish reversal signal? The answer has to do with
what happens over the next session. If the next day opens, and
especially closes, over the inverted hammer’s real body, it
means those who shorted at the opening or closing of the
inverted hammer are losing money. The longer the market
holds above the inverted hammer’s real body, the more likely
these shorts will cover. This could spark a short covering rally
that could lead to bottom pickers going long. This could feed
upon itself with the result being the beginning of a rally.

EXHIBIT 5.25. Oil Service Index—Daily (Inverted Hammer)

On May 24 in Exhibit 5.24, a hammer generated support at
$76. The next day an inverted hammer formed. This was a new
low close for the move, and as such kept the short-term trend
pointing down. However, the hammer’s support was still being
maintained. The May 26 close accomplished two plusses: It
once again confirmed the hammer’s support and it provided
bullish confirmation of the inverted hammer since it was a
close over that line’s real body. If more bullish confirmation
was needed of the solidity of support at $76, it came on June 2
with another hammer.

A bearish engulfing pattern in mid June in Exhibit 5.25 devel-
oped into resistance a few days later. The descent from this fail-
ure at resistance near $82 culminated with an inverted hammer.
This line was confirmed by a higher opening the next day, and
especially with that session’s higher close. The rally from this
inverted hammer continued into the week of July 12 when a
shooting star implied that the bearish engulfing pattern’s resis-
tance was still in force.

ROIs

Put a lid on what smells bad.

M ost of the reversal formations in Chapters 4 and 5 are
comparatively strong reversal signals. They show that
the bulls have taken over from the bears (as in the bullish
engulfing pattern, a morning star, or a piercing pattern) or that
the bears have wrested control from the bulls (as in the bearish
engulfing pattern, the evening star, or the dark-cloud cover).
This chapter examines more reversal indicators that are usual-
ly, but not always, less powerful reversal signals. These include
the harami pattern, tweezers tops and bottoms, belt-hold lines,
the upside-gap two crows, and counterattack lines. This chap-
ter then explores more potent reversal signals that include three
black crows, three mountains, three rivers, dumpling tops, fry-
pan bottoms, and tower tops and bottoms.

EXHIBIT 6.2. Inside Day

THE HARAMI PATTERN

Spinning tops (that is, small real bodies) are components in cer-
tain formations. The harami is one of these formations (the star,
examined in Chapter 5, is another). The harami pattern (see
Exhibit 6.1) is a small real body that is contained within what
the Japanese call “an unusually long black or white real body.”
“Harami” is an old Japanese word for pregnant. The Japanese
nickname for the long candle is the “mother” candle and the
small candle is the “baby” or “fetus.” The second candle of the
harami can be white or black. If, for example, both the first and
second candles of the harami are white, it would be expressed
as “white-white harami.”

The Japanese will say that with a harami the market is “los-
ing its breath.” The bearish harami displays a disparity about
the market’s health. Specifically after a bull move, the long
white real body’s vitality is followed by the small real body’s
uncertainty. Additionally, the small real body opening and clos-
ing within the prior open—close range is another indication that
the bulls’ upward drive has weakened. Thus, a trend reversal is
possible. During a bear move, the selling force reflected by a
long black real body is followed by the second day’s vacillation.
This could portend a trend reversal since the second day's
small real body is an alert that the bears’ power has diminished.

The combination of candle lines in the harami pattern, with
its first tall real body followed by a small real body, is the
reverse of the engulfing pattern. In the engulfing pattern, a
lengthy real body engulfs the preceding small real body.

Another difference between the harami and engulfing pat-
terns is that for the two candles of the engulfing pattern, the
color of the real bodies should be opposite. This is not neces-
sary for the harami. You should find, however, that in most
instances, the real bodies in the harami are oppositely colored.

The harami formation is comparable to the Western inside
day. For a Western inside day (see Exhibit 6.2), the entire range
of the second session has to be within the entire range of the
first session. This is not necessary for harami. For harami all
that is required is that the second real body be within the first
real body, even if the shadow of the second day is above or
below the prior day’s high and low. Notice the bearish harami

Harami Cross
EXHIBIT 6.3. Harami

The regular harami has a tall real body followed by a small real Cross
body. Yet, there are no rules as to what is considered a “small”
candle. This, like many other charting techniques, is subjective.
As the general principle, the more diminutive the second real
body, the more potent the pattern. This is usually true because
the smaller the real body, the greater the ambivalence and the
more likely a trend reversal. In the extremes, as the real body
becomes smaller as the spread between the open and close nar-
rows, a doji is formed. A doji preceded by a long black real
body during a decline (or a tall white real body during a rally)
is a distinctive type of harami referred to as a harami cross
(Exhibit 6.3).

The harami cross, because it contains a doji, is viewed as a
more potent reversal signal than the regular harami pattern by
the Japanese. The harami cross is sometimes referred to as the
petrifying pattern. My best guess as to why it has that nickname
is that the preceding trend has been frozen or petrified in
preparation for a reverse move. A harami cross occurring after
a very long white candle is a pattern a long trader ignores at his
or her own peril. Harami cross can also call bottoms, but they
seem more effective at tops.

Exhibit 6.4 shows a brisk rally that started October 26. The
third white candle of this rally on October 31 pushed the index
over the October 23-24 bearish engulfing pattern’s resistance
(at B). However, whatever cause for optimism the bulls had on
the 31st was short-lived as a harami pattern was completed
with the November 1 candle. That candle’s real body was so
small that it could be considered a harami cross. The series of
spinning tops after the harami reinforced that the trend had
changed from up to neutral. The long black candle on
November 8 completed a tower top (see later in this chapter).

In Exhibit 6.5 a price drop that began with the hanging man
found a floor with the harami of November 4 and 5. The second
real body of this harami was so small that I viewed it as a doji.

Chapter 6 * More Reversal Patterns 85

As such, this is a harami cross. What was especially significant
about the emergence of this pattern was that it helped clearly
confirm a defined support near $61 (shown by the horizontal
support line). If this were a bar chart, we would have the same
support based on the action from early to late September.
Although we’re using a candle chart, we can and should use
traditional bar chart support or resistance areas. Thus, there
was an Eastern signal (harami) confirming a traditional
Western signal (support line).

There was an earlier harami cross pattern on September 29
and 30. With this harami the short-term trend changed up to
lateral. This pattern highlights an important point—one that
was addressed in the introduction to Chapter 4: When a trend
changes it doesn’t necessarily mean that prices will go from,
say, up to down. In both harami in this exhibit the former
uptrend did change after the appearance of the harami. In the
November harami, the trend shifted from down to up and in
the September harami from up to neutral. As such, both harami
correctly forecasted a change of trend.

We are all detectives in the market as we pick up the small
visual clues the market continually sends out. As these clues
unravel, we may have to adjust our market stance. Exhibit 6.6
is an example of this. On April 19 this stock pushed above resis-
tance with an extended white candle. With this bullish break-
out, the signs pointed north. The next day, the texture of the
market had changed with the harami. While this harami
doesn’t immediately convert the short-term trend from up to
down, it was a visual alarm. As such, longs can be scaled back,
protective stops moved higher, etc. The doji after the harami
(on April 24) helped reinforce that the trend had moved from
up to more neutral since the doji represents a time where the
bulls and bears are in equilibrium. The descent from this
harami continued until a bullish engulfing pattern (the first ses-
sion of this pattern was a hammer). The rally from the bullish
engulfing pattern got clogged on May 9 at the doji. The candle
lines marked 1 and 2 were also harami patterns, with line 2,
since it was a doji, forming a harami cross.

Exhibit 6.7 is an example of the ease with which we can meld
candle charting and Western charting tools. A rising resistance
line connects the highs of March 15 and April 12. As will be

detailed in Part 2 of this book (where the focus is on Western
charting tools), a rising resistance line can be an area of supply.
When price intersected this line on May 13 we received visual
confirmation that supply was overcoming demand with that
candle’s bearish upper shadow and then completing a harami.
Observe also how the prior price peak on April 12 and 13 was
also a harami. Hammers at 1 and 2 gave signs of stabilization.

TWEEZERS TOPS AND BOTTOMS

Tweezers are two or more candle lines with matching highs or
lows. They are called tweezers tops and tweezers bottoms because
they are compared to the two prongs of a tweezers. In a rising
market, a tweezers top is formed when the two or more con-
secutive highs match. In a falling market, a tweezers bottom is
made when two or more successive lows are the same. The
tweezers could be composed of real bodies, shadows, and/or
doji. Ideally the tweezers should have a long first candle and a
small real body as the next session. This shows that whatever
force the market had on the first session (bullish force with a
long white candle and bearish force with a long black candle),
it was dissolving with the following small real body with the
same high (for a tweezers top) or same low (for a tweezers bot-
tom). If there is a bearish (for a top reversal) or a bullish (for a
bottom reversal) candle signal that is also a tweezers top, it
adds more importance to the pattern.
Let’s look at Exhibits 6.8 to 6.13 in detail:

Exhibit 6.8 shows how, during an ascent, a long white line is
followed by a doji. This two-candle pattern, a harami cross
with the same high, can be a significant warning.

Exhibit 6.9 illustrates a tweezers top formed by a long white
candle and a hanging man line. If the market opens, and
especially closes, under the hanging man’s real body, odds
are strong that a top has been reached. This two-line mixture
can also be considered a harami. As such, it would be a top
reversal pattern during an uptrend.

¢ Exhibit 6.10 illustrates a tweezers top joined with the second
period’s bearish shooting star line.

EXHIBIT 6.13. Tweezers
Bottom and Piercing
Pattern

¢ As mentioned earlier, an ideal tweezers would have as its
second session not only the same high, but also a small real
body. In Exhibit 6.11 the second candle is not a small real
body. However, this second session completes a variation on
the dark-cloud cover (the second day opens above the prior
day’s close instead of above the prior day’s high). The black
candle session’s high also just touches the prior period’s high
and then falls. Because of this last fact—that is, both sessions
have the same highs—it adds more negative impact to this
variation of the dark-cloud cover.

Exhibit 6.12 shows a hammer session that successfully tests
the prior long black candlestick’s lows. The hammer, and the
successful test of support, proves that the sellers are losing
control of the market. This two-line combination is also a
harami. This would be another reason to view this action as
support.

Exhibit 6.13, while it doesn’t have a small real body for the
second candle, does complete a variation on the bullish
piercing line. (A true piercing line would open under the
prior day’s low. Here it opened under the prior day’s close.)
Because of this I view it also as a tweezers bottom.

These examples of tweezers are not inclusive. They are rep-
resentative of how top and bottom tweezers should be con-
firmed by other candlestick indications so as to be valuable
forecasting tools.

Tweezers should be viewed differently for daily, intraday,
and weekly or long charts. This is because there is nothing
potent about having the same highs or lows for two daily or
intraday sessions. It’s only if these sessions also meet the spe-
cific criteria for a tweezers (the first long, the second short, or a
candle pattern with the same highs or same lows) does it war-
rant attention. As such, the main aspect to keep in mind with
tweezers on a daily or intraday chart is that it takes a special
combination of candle lines to warrant acting upon tweezers.

For those who want a longer time perspective, tweezers tops
and bottoms on the weekly and monthly candlestick charts
made by consecutive candlesticks could be important reversal
patterns. This would be true even without other candle confir-
mation because, on a weekly or monthly chart, for example, a
weekly low this week that successfully holds last week’s lows


--- 第 98 页 ---

Chapter 6 © More Reversal Patterns 89

could be a base for a rally. The same can’t be said of daily or
intraday lows.

Exhibit 6.14 shows the tweezers bottom. Note that the second
real body of this tweezers was not within the first real body and
as such was not a harami pattern. The long white candle after
this tweezers on June 1 was immediately followed by a small
real body with about the same high near $59.50. As such, the
June 1 and June 2 combination can be viewed as the tweezers
top. But in the context of the overall technical picture, the mar-
ket was not overextended and, as such, not so vulnerable to a
correction as should be the case if we had a tweezers top in an
overbought environment. Even if one acted upon the June 1
and June 2 tweezers top (it was also a harami), once the market
closed above the high of these two sessions on June 3, any
potential bearish implication of the tweezers top was negated.

In Exhibit 6.15 a series of falling gaps (gaps are called “win-
dows” in candle charts; windows are discussed in detail in
Chapter 7) at 1, 2, and 3 kept the bearish momentum in force. A
tweezers bottom unfolded with the second candle of the tweez-
ers bottom a hammer. A dark-cloud cover in the week of the

pating

Exhibit 6.16 illustrates a tweezers top. Since the small real
body on February 2 was not within the prior real body, this
would not have been a harami pattern, but it was a tweezers
because of the same high at $55. In addition, the small real body
on February 2 was a hanging man line (the upper shadow is
small enough to keep this as a hanging man line). Of course,
this (like any hanging man line) required bearish confirmation
by a close under the hanging man’s real body. This occurred the
next session.

Dell descended from this tweezers top until a series of ham-
mers in late February—early March showed an area of stabiliza-
tion. The first two hammers on February 26 and March 1 were
not a classic tweezers bottom. Why? While they certainly have
the same lows, the duel hammers did not meet one of the nor-
mal criterion for a tweezers bottom—having the first candle of
the tweezers bottom a long real body. While the dual hammers
on February 26 and March 1 were not classified as a tweezers
bottom, I certainly would emphasize their importance since

they underscored how the market was rejecting lower prices at
$39 with bullish long lower shadows. As such, I would view
the pattern on February 26 and 27 as a variation of a tweezers
bottom.

While the two candle lines on December 22 and 23 in Exhibit
6.17 did not form a dark-cloud cover (since the black candle
wasn’t even near the middle of the long white candle), they did
form a tweezers top. While I would view a dark-cloud cover as
more ominous than a tweezers top (since the regular dark-cloud
cover closes well into the white candle), this tweezers top could
certainly be viewed as a cautionary signal. This was echoed the
next week with the small real bodies and doji reflecting that the
market had gone from a bullish bias to more neutral.

A bullish engulfing pattern at B in Exhibit 6.18 lays the foun-
dation in early February for a rally that continued via a gap on
March 6. As discussed in Chapter 7, the bottom of a rising gap
can become support. The support at the bottom of this gap near
$185 held very well, as attested by the long lower shadow can-
dle of March 8.

The bearish belt-hold (see Exhibit 6.20) is a long black candle EXHIBIT 6.20. Bearish
that opens on the high of the session (or within a few ticks of Belt-Hold Line
the high) and continues lower through the session. If prices are
high, the appearance of a bearish belt-hold is a top reversal. The
bearish belt-hold line is sometimes called a black opening
shaven head.
The longer the height of the belt-hold candle line, the more
significant it becomes. The actual Japanese name for the belt-
hold is a sumo wrestling term, yorikiri, which means “pushing
your opponent out of the ring while holding onto his belt.”
A close above a black bearish belt-hold line should mean a
resumption of the uptrend. A close under the white bullish belt-
hold line implies a renewal of selling pressure.
Belt-hold lines are more important if they confirm resistance
or other belt-hold lines or if they have not appeared for a while.
In Exhibit 6.21 a bearish engulfing pattern at B indicate poten-
tial trouble. The double bearish belt-hold lines came near the
same area as this bearish engulfing pattern and as such helped
further establish this as an area of supply. Although there were
many bearish signals in this short span (the bearish engulfing
pattern and the two bearish belt-hold lines), it does not neces-
sarily forecast the free fall that occurred after the second belt-
hold. This convergence of candle signals increased the likeli-
hood of a turn, but not the extent of the following action.
Arising gap in early June soon became a support zone as evi-
denced by its successful defense through the first half of June.
The June 13 candle was a bullish belt-hold. On the next retest of
the window in late July—early August, another series of bullish
belt-hold lines formed. These last two bullish belt-hold lines

UPSIDE-GAP TWO CROWS

An upside-gap two crows (what a mouthful!) is illustrated in
Exhibit 6.23. It is very rare. The upside-gap refers to the gap
between the real body of the small black real body and the real
body preceding it. (The real body that precedes the first black
candle is usually a long white one.) The two black candles are
the “crows” in this pattern. They are analogous to black crows
peering down ominously from a tree branch. Based on this por-
tentous comparison, it is obviously a bearish pattern. An ideal
upside-gap two crows has the second black real body opening
above the first black real body’s open. It then closes under the
first black candle’s close.

The rationale for the bearish aspect of this pattern is as fol-
lows: The market is in an uptrend and gaps higher on the open.

EXHIBIT 6.25. Corning—Daily (Upside-Gap Two Crows)

The new highs fail to hold and the market forms a black candle.
But the bulls can take some succor, at least, because the close on
this black candle session still holds above the prior day’s close.
The third session paints a more bearish portrait with another
new high and another failure to hold these highs into the close.
More negative, however, is that this session closes under the
prior day’s close. If the market is so strong, why did the new
highs fail to hold and why did the market close lower? Those
are the questions that the bulls are probably nervously asking
themselves. The answers might be that the market may not be
so strong as they would like. If prices fail to regain high ground
the next day (that is, the fourth session), then expect lower
prices.

Exhibit 6.24 has an example of the upside-gap two crows. The
very small falling gap after this pattern highlighted the bears had
taken control. The rally on the week of February 20 stalled at this
gap’s resistance.

Exhibit 6.25 illustrates the significance of viewing a candle
pattern to its immediate surroundings. Although there was an


--- 第 106 页 ---

upside-gap two crows in mid July, this would not have been a
signal to sell. This is because, as will be discussed in detail in
Chapter 7, the stock gapped higher on July 7. A gap up is nor-
mally a bullish sign—whether with candles or bar charts. Thus,
while the upside-gap two crows sends out a warning, I would
view it as less bearish than would be the case in which there
was no gap, such as in Exhibit 6.24.

THREE BLACK CROWS

The upside-gap two crows consists of two black candles. If
there are three declining consecutive black candles, it is called
three black crows pattern (see Exhibit 6.26). The three black crows
presage lower prices if they appear at high price levels or after
a mature advance. Three crows are also sometimes called three-
winged crows. The Japanese have an expression, “Bad news
has wings.” This is an appropriate saying for the three-winged
crow pattern. The three crows are, as the name implies, three
black candles. Likened to the image of a group of crows sitting
ominously in a tall dead tree, the three crows have bearish
implications. The three lines should close at, or near, their lows.
Ideally, each of the openings should also be within the prior
session’s real body.

Exhibit 6.27 illustrates three black crows started April 15. The
descent from the three black crows continued virtually unhin-
dered until the piercing pattern at P. The second and third black
candles of the three black crows (April 16 and 17) opened under
the prior real bodies. While the normal three black crows has an
opening within the prior real body, and these openings were
not in the black real bodies, they could be viewed as more bear-
ish. This is because the second and third black candles opened
under the prior day’s close and failed to gain substantial
ground throughout the remainder of the session.

The three black crows would likely be useful for longer-term
traders. This is because this pattern is completed on the third
black candle. Obviously, by the time this occurs the market has
already corrected substantially. For example, these three black
crows started at $70.75. Since we needed the third black candle
to finish the pattern, we got the signal when the stock was at
$67.87.

EXHIBIT 6.27. Pennzoil—Daily (Three Black Crows)

However, in this case we received an inkling of trouble on the
first black candle session of the three black crows. The reason is
that the stock opens above the prior March high of $70, but by
session’s close the bulls were unable to sustain the new highs as
it closed back under $70. As you will see in Part 2 of this book,
if the market makes a new high and fails to sustain, it could
have bearish implications. This is what unfolded here.

Let’s also look at the prior highs at areas 1 and 2. During time
frame 1 in early February, Pennzoil was ascending to new highs
for the move, but the candles gave us a strong visual warning
flare that all was not well. Specifically, during the latter part of
the week of February 2, although the stock was making higher
highs, higher lows, and higher closes—it did so with small real
bodies and long upper shadows. This certainly showed that the
action was not one-sided in favor of the bulls. The price retreat
ended at the bullish engulfing pattern at B. A rally from there
pushed prices up until the week of March 2, shown as area 2 on
this chart. The rally at 2 was similar to the rally at area 1 inso-
far as area 2 had higher highs, higher lows, and higher closes,

and as such would look healthy if this were a bar chart.
However, from a candlestick perspective, this price ascent on
March 4, 5, and 6 had long upper shadows. This proved the ral- + a 0 =
lying strength was being dissipated. The candle line on March q

6 was a shooting star. EXHIBIT 6.28. Three

THREE ADVANCING WHITE SOLIDERS

The opposite of the three black crows is three advancing white [ 4 °
soldiers or, more commonly, three white soldiers (Exhibit 6.28).
Like much of the candle terminology, this pattern has a military |
association. It is a group of three long white candles with con- |
secutively higher closes. If this pattern appears at a low price EXHIBIT 6.29. Advance
area or after a period of stable prices, then it is a sign of strength Block
ahead.

The three white soldiers are a gradual and steady rise with l Q

each white line opening within or near the prior session’s white

real body. Each of the white candles should close at, or near, its

highs. It is a healthy method for the market to rise (although if | |
the white candles are very extended, one should be cautious |
about an overbought market).

If the second and third or just the third candle shows signs of EXHIBIT 6.30. Stalled
weakening, it is an advance block pattern (see Exhibit 6.29). This Pattern
means the rally is running into trouble and longs should pro-
tect themselves. Be especially cautious about this pattern dur-
ing a mature uptrend. Signs of weakening could be progres-
sively smaller white real bodies or relatively long upper shad-
ows.

If the last two candles are long white ones that make a new
high followed by a small white candle, it is called a stalled pat-
tern (see Exhibit 6.30). It is also sometimes called a deliberation
pattern. The bulls’ strength has been at least temporarily
exhausted after this formation. This last small white candle can
either gap away from the long white body (in which case it
becomes a star) or it can be, as the Japanese express it, “riding
on the shoulder” of the long white real body (that is, be at the
upper end of the prior long white real body). The small real
body discloses a deterioration of the bulls’ power.

Although the advance block and stalled patterns are not nor-
mally top reversal patterns, they can sometimes precede a price

decline. The advance block and stalled patterns should be used
to liquidate or protect longs, but usually not to short. They are
generally more consequential at higher price levels.

As shown in Exhibits 6.28 through 6.30, these patterns can be
at a low price area or during a rally.

There is not much difference between the advance block and
stalled pattern. The main factor to consider with three white
soldiers is that it is most constructive for each of the three can-
dles to close at or near its highs. If the latter two white candles
show signs of hesitation, either with small real bodies or upper
shadows, then it is a clue that the rally is losing force.

Exhibit 6.31 illustrates almost a classic three white soldiers
since each candle, especially the last two, were relatively
strong, opening near their lows and closing at, or near, their
highs. A sign of hesitation came with the doji on April 23 since
it formed a harami cross.

Exhibit 6.32 has a good example of the three white soldiers.
Each of the three candle lines closed very near to the highs of
the session and each white candle opened within or above the
prior white candle. An aspect to consider is by the time the
three white soldiers is completed, the market could be well off
its lows. In this case, Microsoft was almost $4 from its lows, a
high percentage move. Consequently, unless one is longer-term
bullish, buying at the completion of these three white soldiers
may not present an attractive risk/reward.

I have found that on corrections, the first or second white
candle that started the three white soldiers is often support. In
this example, the stock consolidated. after three white soldiers
and slowly pulled back until a hammer was formed. That tend-
ed to confirm support within the second white candle of the
three soldiers.

In Exhibit 6.33 a base was forming from mid to late June and
early July near $36.50. Then three white soldiers emerged
(although they had very small upper shadows). After the third
white soldier, the stock hesitated and corrected to the first
white solider of July 11. This chart again illustrates that the
market may sometimes correct after the three white soldiers.
We should expect support as the stock gets to the second, or
especially the first, white soldier.

An advance block pattern is illustrated in Exhibit 6.34.
Although there were three relatively tall white candles, the last

two had bearish upper shadows. This reflected a stalling of the
rally. Indeed, a series of more upper shadows, labeled as 1 and
2, highlighted this resistance near $51. The long upper shadow
candle at 2 was a shooting star and the next day completed a
bearish engulfing pattern.

THREE MOUNTAINS AND THREE RIVERS

There is a group of longer-term topping and bottoming pat-
terns that includes the three mountains, the three rivers, the
three Buddha tops, inverted three Buddha, dumpling tops, fry-
pan bottoms, and tower tops and bottoms.

Similar to the Western triple top, the Japanese have a three
mountain top (see Exhibit 6.35). It is supposed to represent a
major top. If the market backs off from a high three times or
makes three attempts at a high, it is deemed a three mountain
top. The high point of the final mountain ideally should be con-
firmed with a bearish candle indicator (for example, a doji or
dark-cloud cover). If the central mountain of a three mountain
top is the highest mountain, it is a special type of three moun-
tain called a three Buddha top (see Exhibit 6.36). The reason for
this name is because, in Buddhist temples, there is a large cen-
tral Buddha with smaller Buddhas (that is, saints) on both
sides. This is the same pattern as the West’s head and shoulders
top.

Although the three Buddha top is analogous to the Western
head and shoulders pattern, the theory about the Japanese
three Buddha pattern was used over a hundred years before the
head and shoulders was known in America. (The earliest I have
seen a reference to a head and shoulders pattern in the United
States was by Richard Schabacker in the 1930s. For those who
are familiar with the Edwards and Magee classic book, Technical
Analysis of Stock Trends, much of the material in that book is
based on Schabacker’s work. Schabacker was Edwards’s
father-in-law.)

It is intriguing how market observers from both the West and
the East have come up with this same pattern. Market psychol-
ogy is the same around the world, or, as a Japanese proverb
expresses, “The tone of a bird’s song is the same everywhere.”
The three river bottom pattern (see Exhibit 6.37) is the opposite of
the three mountain top. This occurs when the market tests a
bottom level three times. The peak of the troughs should be
exceeded to confirm a bottom. The equivalent of the Western
inverted head and shoulders bottom is called, not surprisingly,
an inverted three Buddha (see Exhibit 6.38).

Area A in Exhibit 6.39 shows hesitation near $124, especially
with the bearish engulfing pattern made in the last two weeks
in November. The retreat from this bearish engulfing pattern

THE IMPORTANCE OF THE NUMBER THREE
IN CANDLESTICK ANALYSIS

Many of the Japanese techniques are based on the number three. This
reflects the importance of the number three in the Japanese culture.
In premodern Japan, the number three had almost mystical associa-
tions. The saying “three times lucky” expresses this belief. Other
examples of three in candle charts include the three white soldiers, the
ominous three black crows, the aforementioned three mountain top
arid’ bottom and their variations, the three Buddha patterns, the rising
-and falling three methods, and’the three candle patterns of the morn-
ing and evening : stars. (Some of these patterns are discussed later.)

found stabilization at a bullish engulfing pattern. The ascent
from this bullish engulfing pattern stopped, not surprisingly at
the aforementioned bearish engulfing pattern’s resistance near
$124 at B. B was another bearish engulfing pattern. The next
rally in mid May and the subsequent bearish engulfing pattern
at C put a three mountain top in place.

In Exhibit 6.39, the peaks of each mountain were almost the
same. This is not necessary. It is still considered a three moun-
tain top if the three price peaks are not exactly at the same
highs. In Exhibit 6.40, price crested at A, B, and C, with B and
C at slightly higher levels. This would still be considered a
three mountain top. During the last two sessions at C, Intel was
rising with two very small real bodies. This was a symptom of
uneasiness. The price peak came at $76, a shooting star. The real
turning signal, and the confirmation of the three Buddha top,
came with the gap down after the late August shooting star.

While a three mountain top has nearly the same highs, the
three Buddha top has the middle portion as the highest high.
Again we can think of the three Buddha top as comparable to


--- 第 115 页 ---

EXHIBIT 6.40. Intel—Weekly (Three Mountain Top)

the head and shoulders top. In Exhibit 6.41 we see a three
Buddha, a.k.a head and shoulders top, with the price peaks at
1, 2, and 3 defining the pattern. The rising line shown on the
chart in Western terms would be called the neckline of the head
and shoulders top. Classically, the neckline of the head and
shoulders top once broken should become resistance. This is
what unfolded with the break of the neckline on August 19 and
then a little rebound on August 21 (and three sessions after
that), stopping at the neckline’s new resistance as confirmed by
the bearish upper shadows.

Exhibit 6.42 is another example of the three Buddha top.
Since this pattern is the same as the head and shoulders top, we
can shift into the Western technicals based on the concept of the
head and shoulders neckline discussed in the previous exhibit.

Specifically, once the neckline was broken, it became resis-
tance. The market tried to stabilize with a little bullish engulf-
ing pattern around 13:00, but the failure to push this index
above the neckline resistant kept the bears in control. This
reflects how critical it is to think about where a candle pattern

EXHIBIT 6.41. Yen/Dollar—Daily (Three Buddha Top)

is formed. In this instance the bullish engulfing pattern is a
potential bottoming signal, but wouldn’t it make sense to let
the market close over the neckline’s resistance before buying—
even with the bullish engulfing pattern? It does pay to wait,
since such a close over the neckline would help reinforce that
the bulls have more control.

Our Western inverted head and shoulders is the same as the
Japanese inverted three Buddha. That is, there are three lows
made with the middle low as the lowest. This is shown in
Exhibit 6.43 at lows at A, B, and C. Since the low at B was under
the low at A or C, it formed an inverted three Buddha. Note
how once the bulls pushed the pound above 163 with the tall
white candle in early January, that prior resistance around 163
became support. This concept of a former resistance area being
converted into new support is a powerful trading technique
that is discussed in Chapter 11.

Exhibit 6.44 has an inverted three Buddha. Notice once again
how a former resistance area from March near $52 to $52.50
once penetrated became a support zone for most of April.

COUNTERATTACK LINES

Counterattack lines are formed when opposite colored candles
have the same close. The best way to describe this pattern is by
discussing the illustrations in Exhibits 6.45 and 6.46.

Exhibit 6.45 is an example of a bullish counterattack line. This
pattern occurs during a decline. The first candle of this pattern
is usually a long black candle. The next session opens sharply
lower. At this point, the bears are feeling confident. The bulls
then stage their counterattack as they push prices back up to
unchanged from the prior close. The prior downtrend has then
been bridled.

The bullish counterattack is comparable to the bullish pierc-
ing line. If you remember, the piercing line has the same two-
candle configuration as that shown for the bullish counterat-
tack pattern. The main difference is that the bullish counterat-
tack line does not move into the prior session’s white real body.
It just gets back to the prior session’s close. The piercing pat-
tern’s second line pushes well into the black real body.

Consequently, the piercing pattern is a more significant bottom
reversal than is this bullish counterattack line. Nonetheless, as
shown in some examples below, the bullish counterattack line
should be respected, since it proves that there is a change in the
flow of direction of the market.

Exhibit 6.46 illustrates the bearish counterattack line. The first
candle, a long white one, keeps the bullish momentum going.
The next session’s opening gaps higher. The longs are happy—
then the bears come out fighting and pull prices to the prior
day’s close. The bulls’ tide of optimism on the second day’s
opening probably turned to apprehension by the close.

As the bullish counterattack line is related to the piercing
line, so the bearish counterattack line is related to the dark-
cloud cover. The bearish counterattack, like the dark-cloud
cover, should ideally open above the prior day’s high. Unlike
the dark-cloud cover, though, the close does not go into the
prior day’s white candle. Thus, the dark-cloud cover sends a
stronger top reversal signal than does the bearish counterattack
line.

An important consideration of counterattack lines is if that
second session should open robustly higher (in the case of the
bearish counterattack) or sharply lower (for the bullish coun-
terattack). The idea is that on the opening of the second day of
this pattern, the market has moved strongly in the direction of
the original trend. Then, surprise! By the close, it moves back to
unchanged from the prior session. In doing so, it changes the
market's texture in one day.

In Exhibit 6.47 on March 10, the stock surged one dollar high-
er on the opening than the prior day’s close. By session’s end
the whole bullish hue of the stock had changed since the bears
dragged down prices to the prior close of March 7. This bearish
counterattack line of March 10 was the first of three black can-
dles that completed the three black crows.

As mentioned in the section of three black crows, because we
need to wait for three black candles for the completion of that
signal, much of the move may be lost by the time the third can-
dle of the three black crows unfolds. In this case, however, with
the first black candle’s counterattack line, we would have
received an early turning signal in one session that was further
confirmed with the three black crows.

EXHIBIT 6.47. Bank One—Daily (Bearish Counterattack Lines)

Exhibit 6.48 illustrates a bearish counterattack line emerging

October 15. We can see that the counterattack did not

close

exactly at the prior white candle’s close but marginally below

the prior close. With the counterattack lines, as is true

with

most candlestick signals, there is room for flexibility in the def-
inition of the pattern. For example, on December 6 there was a
bullish counterattack line. On that session, the stock gapped
sharply lower on the opening and, by session’s end, closed
almost, but not exactly, at the prior day’s close. I would still
view this as a bullish counterattack pattern, although the stock
did not close exactly the same as the prior close, but certainly
was close enough. The main criterion in this bullish counterat-
tack was the impressive rebound on the white candle from its

weak opening.
In Exhibit 6.49 a bearish counterattack pattern helped

con-

firm July’s significant resistance near $138-$139. Again, the two
closes were not exactly equal, but close enough to validate this
pattern. This chart highlights how easy it is to use candles to
get extra confirmation of resistance. While this $138-$139 resis-

tance would be available on a bar chart, there is no such thing
as a “counterattack” concept with bar charts. Thus, by substi-
tuting candle charts for bar charts, a trader gets all the bar chart
signals (such as resistance areas) with the bonus of the unique
candle indicators.

A bullish counterattack line is shown in Exhibit 6.50 at the
January 12 lows. This helped confirm a support area in place
since mid December between $25.50 and $27.

This chart also highlights what I call a “cluster of candles.”
By this I mean a convergence, or grouping, of candle signals
that reinforce a specific resistance or support area. With this in
mind, let’s look at how a cluster of candle signals, denoted by
1+4, reinforced resistance.

1. A shooting star. The next day completed a bearish engulfing
pattern.

2. The black real body that intruded well into the prior white
real body formed a dark-cloud cover.

3. Another dark-cloud cover.
4. A bearish engulfing pattern.

EXHIBIT 6.51. Dumpling Top

After the clues at 1-4 above, would one think there is resis-
tance between $38 and $39.50? As my 11-year-old son would
say, “Duh.” This technique of a cluster of candles underscores
the importance of having a group of signals, whether candles
signals or Western signals, converging at one area to increase
the importance of that specific area. Convergence is the focus of
Part 2 of this book.

DUMPLING TOPS AND FRYPAN BOTTOMS

Dumpling tops and frypan bottoms. Someone must have been
hungry when they thought of these names!

The dumpling top (Exhibit 6.51) is a top reversal that usually
has small real bodies as the market forms a convex pattern.
Confirmation of the dumpling top is when the market gaps
down. This pattern is the same as the Western rounded top. The
only difference is that the dumpling top has the extra bearish
kicker of a gap lower. (A gap down is called a “falling window”
in candle terminology. See Chapter 7.)

The frypan bottom (Exhibit 6.52) reflects a market that is bot-
toming and whose price action forms a concave design and
then opens a gap to the upside (i.e., a rising window). It has the
same appearance as a Western rounded bottom, but the
Japanese frypan bottom must have a gap higher to confirm this
pattern.

I like the concept behind these patterns. With the frypan bot-
tom, the market goes from lower lows to the same lows and
then higher lows. This pictorially proves that the bears are los-
ing a foothold. Then, when you add a rising gap to this sce-
nario, it gives even more proof that the bears have lost control
of the market.

The Japanese will say that with a frypan bottom the market
becomes “immune to bad news.” As such, if a market builds a

frypan bottom—especially in spite of bearish news—it would
be very impressive. As Bernard Baruch stated, “What is impor-
tant are not the events themselves, but the human reaction to
these events.”

The same is true with the dumpling top, but in reverse. That
is, the market is ascending with higher highs and goes into a
period where the highs are the same, and then goes to lower
highs. As such, the pace of the rally is slackening. Then when
you have a gap down to complete the dumpling top, it just puts
another nail in the bulls’ coffin.

Exhibit 6.53 illustrates the dumpling top where the stock is
making a series of higher highs early on August 24. A few 60-
minute sessions of long upper shadows and the dark-cloud
cover at noon on that day gave a minor clue of some hesitation
near $93.50. The final confirmation came with the lower highs
made on the two sessions after the dark-cloud cover and then
the gap down, which completed the dumpling top.

Exhibit 6.54 illustrates how IBM started stalling the week of
July 12 as it went from mostly white real bodies the preceding
week to black real bodies that were making mostly lower highs.
The gap down completed the dumpling top.

In mid July in Exhibit 6.55 the stock was holding its highs
near $55. But look at how these highs were being maintained—
through a series of small real bodies and even a long-legged
doji on July 16. These spinning tops and doji showed just how
confused this stock really was. The gap down on the week of
the 20th completed a classic dumpling top. As will be discussed
in Chapter 7, when there is a gap down, that gap often becomes
resistance. Note how the gap of this dumpling top (made on
July 24) became an upside barrier a few days later.

In Exhibit 6.56 the July 7 long black candle reflected how
hard this stock was hit. The only mitigating factor was that ses-
sion’s lower shadow. But one session’s long lower shadow
doesn’t change the trend from down to more positive. During
the next few days, a series of long lower shadows echoed sup-
port near $13.50. The appearance of a white candle on July 10
was a successful defense of those lower shadows’ support area
that also completed a bullish piercing pattern. With the next

session's higher low, and the gap higher on July 13, this stock
had built a frypan bottom.

In Exhibit 6.57 a series of consecutive black candles during
the week of July 19 kept the stock under pressure. Some
diminutive real bodies and doji the next couple of weeks hint-
ed that the stock was stabilizing. Final bullish proof of the
breakout from this base came with a very small gap (shown at
the arrow) made between August 5 and 6. As this chart illus-
trates, even if the gap is very small (i.e., a few cents) it is still
considered a gap and thus validates this frypan bottom. The
same would be true with the dumpling top. That is, even if
there were a small gap to the downside, no matter how small,
it would still confirm a dumpling top.

Exhibit 6.58 nicely illustrates the difference between the
Western rounding bottom and the Eastern frypan bottom. From
September 1 through the week of September 14, the stock was
building a rounding bottom (since it was going from lower
lows to the same lows and then higher lows). However, since
this rounding bottom did not have a rising gap, it was not a fry-
pan bottom. Remember, a frypan bottom is the same as a

rounding bottom of the West, plus it has the extract push of a
gap higher. With the aforementioned September’s rounding
bottom, we get signs of caution at 1 and 2 with their long upper
shadows (2 was a shooting star).

Let’s now turn our attention to activity from early to the lat-
ter part of October. At that time the stock was building a round-
ing bottom (that is, going from lower lows to higher lows).
With the small rising gap on September 26, it became a frypan
bottom with all its inherent bullish potential. Because of the ris-
ing gap in the frypan bottom (that the classic rounding bottom
lacks), I view frypan bottom as more significant than a classic
rounding bottom.

TOWER TOPS AND BOTTOMS

The tower top unfolds at high price levels. During a rally, there
is a short-term lull after one or more white candles. Then one or
more large black candles emerge. This creates a top with a

white and black “tower” on either side of the small real bodies
(see Exhibit 6.59). That is, long candles on the way down and
long candles on the way up.

The tower bottom (see Exhibit 6.60) occurs in a descending
market in which one or more tall black candles keep the bear-
ish momentum intact. Then some small real bodies lessen the
bearish tone and finally a tall white candle finalizes the tower
bottom.

The closest Western comparison to the tower top and bottom
would be the spike, or V, reversal. In the spike reversal, the
market is in a strong trend and then abruptly reverses to a new
trend.

The tower top and bottom, like some other candlestick sig-
nals such as three black crows, may be most useful for longer-
term traders since the tower is often finalized late in the move.

The tower bottom is analogous to the frypan bottom while
the tower top is similar to the dumpling top. The main distinc-
tion between these two patterns is that long black and white
candles are needed for the towers and there is no gap required.
The dumpling top and frypan bottom require gaps.

Exhibit 6.61 highlights the difference between the tower top
and the dumpling top. The stock moved up in the first week of
October with a series of white real bodies and then started
treading water with a series of small real bodies. The gap down
on October 15 formed a dumpling top. Shifting our attention to
late December, we see a series of extended white candles.
Candle line 1 was still healthy, but the small real bodies follow-
ing 1 illustrated that this stock had a poor chance of rising. The
long black candle at 2 was the second “tower” needed to com-
plete the tower top.

In Exhibit 6.62, a hammer in late December hinted of stabi-
lization. The rally from the hammer continued with a tall white
candle on December 29. However, as the stock got within
shooting distance of a resistance area from early December near
$35.75, a group of small real bodies arose. The December 30th
candle made a harami pattern. The harami pattern and the
spinning tops signaled caution. The trend turned more omi-
nous with the emergence of the January 5 long black real body
that completed the tower top.

As discussed earlier, sometimes tower tops send out a signal
late in the move (since we have to wait for a black candle). In
this case, however, the reversal signal 4 la the harami came
early. Indeed, the December 30 candle was so tiny that it could
be viewed as a harami cross.

A classic tower bottom is shown in Exhibit 6.63. The first
tower consists of an extended black real body on July 28. The
next day’s doji makes a harami cross. (Observe another harami
cross at H on July 24 and July 25. Once the index broke under
that pattern, any bullish applications of that particular harami
cross were voided.) The ascent from the late July harami cross
began with a couple of small white real bodies with the longer-
term turning signal arising with the tall white candle on
August 3, since this completed a tower bottom. The rally con-
tinued from this tower bottom until late August when the S&P
staled at the resistance area set by the July 17 shooting star.

In Exhibit 6.64 a hammer on April 1 hinted that the market
was groping for a bottom. The long black candle the next day,
with a marginal close under the hammer’s support area (the

low of the hammer’s lower shadow), puts the trend back down.
A series of small real bodies emerged immediately after this
black candle. This mitigates much of the bearish implications of
the aforementioned black candle. The stock’s health further
improved with the April 12 long white candle. This was the sec-
ond tower of the tower bottom (with the April 2 black candle
being the first tower).

Although the stock was propelled sharply higher after the
tower bottom, remember that this tower bottom had nothing to
do with the extent of the move. As was discussed before, and I
want to emphasize again, candles are potent turning signals,
but don’t give price targets.

An arrow in Exhibit 6.65 points to a long black real body that
propelled the market to a new low for the move. A small white
real body followed this bearish candle, forming a harami pat-
tern. An extended white body followed six weeks of consolida-
tion and thus completed a tower bottom.

Fate aids the courageous.

Il of the candle signals we’ve seen so far have been rever-
sals. In fact, most candle signals are trend reversals. There
are, however, a group of candle patterns that are continuation
indicators. A continuation pattern is one in which the market
should continue the same trend as that in force before the con-
tinuation pattern. For instance, a continuation pattern follow-
ing a rally means that the trend remains up and we should
expect the rally to remain in force. (This, however, does not pre-
clude a correction after the continuation pattern before the
rally, hopefully, unfolds.)
As the Japanese express it, “There are times to buy, times to
sell, and times to rest.” Many of these continuation patterns

imply a time of rest, a breather, before the market resumes its
prior trend. The continuation formations reviewed in this chap-
ter are windows (and patterns that include windows), the ris-
ing and falling three methods, separating lines, and three white
soldiers.

WINDOWS

The Japanese refer to what we call in the West a gap as a win-
dow. Whereas the Western expression is “filling in the gap,” the
Japanese would say, “closing the window.” In this section I will
explain the basic concepts of windows and then explore other
patterns containing windows. Throughout my seminars and in
this book I often use the terms “windows” and “gaps” inter-
changeably.

There are two kinds of windows, one bullish and the other
bearish. A rising window (see Exhibit 7.1) is a bullish signal.
There is a price vacuum between the prior session’s high (that
is, the top of the upper shadow) and the current session’s low
(e.g., the bottom of the lower shadow).

Exhibit 7.2 displays a falling window. This is a bearish signal
in which there is a gap between the prior session’s low and the
current session’s high.

It is said by Japanese technicians to “go in the direction of the
window.” This is because windows are continuation signals.
Consequently, with the emergence of a rising window, one
should look to buy on dips, and with a falling window to sell
on bounces.

It is also said by the Japanese that “corrections stop at the
window.” This means windows can become support and resis-
tance areas. Thus, a rising window (as we'll see soon, this
means the entire window) should also be a zone of support on
pullbacks. If the pullback closes under the bottom of the win-
dow, the prior uptrend is voided. Note that in Exhibit 7.1, the
market got under the bottom of the window, but since it didn’t
close under this area, the rising windows support remains
intact.

Likewise, a falling window implies still lower levels. Any
price rebounds should run into resistance at this falling win-
dow (the entire window). If the bulls have enough force to close


--- 第 136 页 ---

Chapter 7 © Continuation Patterns

the market above the top of the falling window, the downtrend
is done.

There is a belief in the West that a gap is always filled. I don’t
know if this is true, but using the concept that corrections stop
at a window, once prices try to fill a gap we can then consider
buying (in a rising window) or selling (in a falling window).

Based on questions from my public and institutional semi-
nars, the most common misunderstanding with windows is
that some will view a pattern as a window if the real bodies
don’t touch. For instance, candle lines A and B in Exhibit 7.3
have a large space between their real bodies. However, because
the shadows of A and B overlapped, this was not a window. A
window, as shown in Exhibits 7.1 and 7.2, must have no over-
lap between the shadows. No matter how large the “gap”
between the real bodies, it is not a window unless there is a
space between the shadows.

In Exhibit 7.3 we see a small rising window of only 4 cents
between the high of July 22 and the next day’s low. No matter
how tiny a rising window, that window should be potential
support. The same is true with a falling window as resistance.

Part 1 ¢ The Basics

Size doesn’t matter with windows. The long lower shadows as
it descended toward the rising window’s support in Exhibit 7.3,
underscored the demand near that window. Although the ris-
ing window is a potential support zone, as this chart shows, the
market may not get down to exactly (or even near) the win-
dow’s support zone before bouncing. Therefore, if you are
aggressively bullish as a market approaches the rising window,
you can consider buying even if it gets close to the top of the
window and not within the window. How one uses a window
is dependent on trading style and aggressiveness. There should
be a stop (mental or otherwise) if the market closes under the
bottom of the rising window.

In Exhibit 7.3 we saw how a tiny rising window became sup-
port. In Exhibit 7.4 there is a very large rising window between
$20.50 and $22.50. This gives a $2 zone of support (from the top
of the window at $22.50 to the bottom at $20.50).

As previously discussed, the entire rising window becomes a
potential support zone. The disadvantage with a large window
is that the whole zone is potential support. Consequently, we
don’t have so tight a support (with a rising window) or resis-

tance (with a falling window) as one would have with a very
small window.

In instances in which there are relatively large windows,
remember that the key support area for a rising window is the
bottom of the window (for a falling window, the critical resistance
is the top of the window). Consequently, the “last gasp” of sup-
port with a rising window is at the bottom of that window shown
by the dashed line. In this chart the market touched the window’s
low near $20.50 and bounced via a hammer on April 20.

Let’s look at the two other rising windows labeled 1 and 2.
Window 1 held well as support for the next three weeks before
the April 6 candle broke its support. The support at window 2
was broken the day after this window opened. After window
2 was breached, the window at 1 became support. This is how
I sometimes use windows. If, for example, a window’s support
is broken, I will look for another window under the one that
was broken as my next support area. In this case, once the win-
dow at 2 was broken, my next support was at window 1.

Exhibit 7.5 shows an example of the importance of consider-
ing the overall technical picture before reacting to a single can-
dle signal. The first candle line on March 1 was a bullish ham-
mer. But more significantly, look at how that hammer unfold-
ed—with a falling window. While this hammer immediately
became a support level, we should remember that because of
the falling window, there is now resistance within that entire
window. The bounce from the hammer ran out of steam at the
top of the falling window.

Note how the window in Exhibit 7.5 was made between the
last candle line of February 28 and the first candle of the next
day (March 1). This is illustrative of a concept with windows on
intraday charts; windows are mostly formed between the last
candle line on the prior day and the first line of the current day.
This is not surprising since it will be unusual, say on a 5-minute
chart, to have a gap from one 5-minute session to the immedi-
ate next 5-minute session.

As shown in Exhibit 7.6, there was a dynamic two-day rally
in late June. The harami cross told us that the stock was sepa-
rating from its prior uptrend. (The July 1 second candle within
prior tall white real body was so diminutive that it could for all
intents and purposes be considered a harami cross.) The ideal

doji the next day (July 2) echoed what was hinted at the candle
line before, to wit, that the market was separating from its trend
(i.e. up) near $98. A bearish engulfing pattern in mid July was
more proof of trouble overhead.

A small falling window opened between July 27 and 28
(shown as 1) and then another falling window (at 2) on the
29th. This second falling window did the most damage, since it
also gapped under a support area near $95 that had been in
place through the first half of July (this is called a “breakaway
gap” in Western parlance). Not surprisingly, this window, near
$95, became pivotal resistance.

One of the major factors for the remarkable appeal of candles
is that they will often provide signals not available with bar
charts. Exhibit 7.7 shows how we can use windows to get a resis-
tance area not available with bar charts. A hammer emerged on
October 8. This was a potentially bullish sign, but the day of the
hammer was also a falling window. Therefore, one should wait
for a close back over the top of the falling window to corroborate
the potentially positive indications of the hammer.

EXHIBIT 7.7. Oil Service Index—Daily (Windows)


--- 第 141 页 ---

132

Part 1 © The Basics

Two days after the hammer, the bulls proved their mettle by
closing above the top of the falling window, and did so with a
bullish rising window. In doing this, the Oil Service Index built
what in the West is called an island bottom. (This is when the
market gaps down, and then within one or a few sessions, gaps
up. The name “island bottom” is derived because one or few
sessions are like an island surrounded by the water on either
side [i.e., the gaps].) While the low of the island bottom is a nat-
ural support area (in this chart it is near 45.50), we can shift to
our candle charting technique of windows to get an even earli-
er support area.

Using the concept that a rising window should be support,
once the island bottom is completed on October 12 (with the
rising window), our first support is not 45.50 (the low of the
island bottom), but near 49.00 because of the rising window.
This window’s support is where the index stabilized for the
next few days before exploding with a long white real body.
This is yet another example of how candle charting techniques
will help get a jump on those who use only bar charting tools,
since those using bar charts would use the bottom of the island
bottom (at 45.50) as first support, rather than the candle’s rising
window at 49.00. Of course, if the market had breached the
window’s support area, we would look for next support
toward 45.50 (the low of the island bottom and the hammer).

Traditional Japanese technical analysis posits that after three
up or down windows, the chances are that the market is too
overbought to continue ascending (in the case of three rising
windows) or too oversold to keep the downtrend in force (with
three falling windows). This probably has to do with the impor-
tance of the number three to the Japanese. However, I have
fine-tuned this concept since the first edition of this book.

Windows are so dominant that I have found that no matter
how many windows there are, the trend is still intact until the
last window is closed. There could be any number of rising
windows. The trend is still up until voided by the market clos-
ing under the top window. An example of this is illustrated in
Exhibit 7.8. Here we see a rally that started with the bullish
engulfing pattern at B in mid August. Ultimately this rally
opened six rising windows. We got an early clue that the bonds
were losing their breath with the October 5 and 6 harami pat-

tern. But it took the close under the sixth rising window to con-
firm the rally was over. This reversal turned out to be a major
high in bond futures as the market slid for years after.

Exhibit 7.9 is another instance of how a rally can continue
even if there are three rising windows. The rising windows are
shown at 1, 2, 3, and 4. Each of these held as support. The
falling window at A gave an indication of some trouble with
that window acting as resistance at $46. The descent from that
falling window continued until the first week in May.

On May 4a black real body punctured the bottom of window
4’s support at $42.50. This breaking of window 4’s support had
potentially further bearish implications for Microsoft.
However, the next day, May 5, a powerful white candle (a
bullish belt-hold line that opened on its low and closed to near
its high) formed a classic piercing pattern. This negated some of
the prior day’s bearish implications.

This chart is an example of the importance of adapting to the
changing market environment as we went from a bearish out-

look with May 4’s breaking of support to a less bearish view the
next day because of the piercing pattern.

In the next two trading sessions, on May 11 and May 12, a
similar scenario unfolded with a black real body followed by a
white real body. If further proof of major support near $41 was
needed, it came on May 26 and 27 with a bullish engulfing pat-
tern. Indeed, if one looks at the three candle lines on May 29
through June 2, it could be viewed as a morning star pattern
(although classically we like a morning star to come after a
downtrend and not as part of the trading range as it was here).
Nonetheless, this pattern did confirm the solidity of support
near $41.

TASUKI

As shown in Exhibits 7.10 and 7.11 the tasuki are a specific com-
bination of two candle lines that gap higher or lower. The
upward gapping tasuki in Exhibit 7.10 is made of a rising window
formed by a white candle and then a black candle. The black


--- 第 144 页 ---

Chapter 7 © Continuation Patterns 135

candle opens within the white real body and closes under the
white candle’s real body. The close on the black candle day is
the fight point. If the market closes under the bottom of the
window, the bullish outlook of the upward gap tasuki is void-
ed. The same concept is true in reverse for a downward gapping
tasuki (see Exhibit 7.11). The market opens a falling window
with a black candle followed by a white candle. The two can-
dles of the tasuki should be about the same size. Both types of
tasuki are rare.

Based on my extra twelve years of experience since the first
edition of this book, I have recommended at my seminars that
there is little reason to waste brain cells on remembering the
tasuki. The window is so overwhelmingly important that, in
my opinion, it really doesn’t matter the color or combination of
candle lines after the rising window. It is the window itself that
is critical. All one needs to remember is that if there is a rising
window (such as the upward tasuki), it is a bullish signal and
the window should be support. A close under this support
would turn the trend down. The same is true in reverse for the
downward tasuki. That is, since the downward gapping tasuki

has a falling window, the window should be resistance. A close
over the top of the falling window would void the bearish
implications of the downward gapping tasuki.

In Exhibit 7.12 a diminutive rising window opened late
September. The two candles after this rising window formed
the upward gapping tasuki. It’s a tasuki because of the white
candle followed by the black after the rising window. However,
as mentioned above, in my opinion it doesn’t matter what the
candle lines look like after the rising window. My main concern
is looking at that rising window as support based on the close.
As shown with the dashed line, that support managed to hold
based on the close. Then, significantly in late October, a bullish
belt-hold line that wrapped around three black real bodies gave
final confirmation of that window’s support.

High-Price and Low-Price Gapping Plays

It is normal after a sharp advance for the market to consolidate
the gains. Sometimes this consolidation is by a series of small
real bodies. A group of small real bodies after a strong white
session tells us that the market is undecided. These small real
bodies, while changing the trend from up to neutral, are in a
sense healthy since, by treading water, the market is then
relieving its overbought condition. If there is a rising window
from these small real bodies, it is a bullish signal. This is the
high-price gapping play pattern (see Exhibit 7.13). It is called this
because prices hover near their recent highs and then gap to the
upside.

A low-price gapping play is, not surprisingly, the bearish coun-
terpart of the high-price gapping play. The low-price gapping
play (see Exhibit 7.14) is a downside window from a low-price
congestion band. This congestion band (a series of small real
bodies) initially stabilized a steep decline. At first, this group of
small candles gives the appearance that a base is forming. The
break to the downside via a window dashes these bullish
hopes.

In Exhibit 7.15 a hammer on July 31 proved to be the low of
the move as the market ascended into the early part of August
with a rising window. A long black real body during the week
of August 7 made a dark-cloud cover, putting a temporary
damper on the rally.

EXHIBIT 7.15. Corning—Daily (High-Price Gapping Play)

During the week of August 21, a series of small real bodies
following a tall white candle showed us that the stock had
reached a lull. The small rising window on August 28 proved
that the bulls had taken full control as the market completed a
high-price gapping play.

The bullish implications of this gapping play, or any high-
price gapping play, would be voided if the market closed under
the rising window that completes the gapping play. The reverse
would be true for a low-price gapping play.

In Exhibit 7.16 we see a tall white candle on June 29. The doji
on June 30 following the tall white candle showed that the stock
had gone from up to more neutral since these two candle lines
made a harami cross. The small real bodies following this doji
just echoed this outlook. Note how at the bottom of the chart,
the tight trading range echoed by the four small real bodies
resulted in the oscillator going from an overbought condition at
1 to a neutral reading at 2. This is an aspect discussed in the
introduction to this section on gapping plays, namely the small
real bodies of the gapping play helped relieve an overbought

reading. With the stock not overbought at 2, it made it easier for
the market to rally. Once the stock opened a small window on
July 7, it formed a high-price gapping play. A dumpling top
unfolded in mid July.

A harami pattern in early April in Exhibit 7.17 helped short-
circuit a rally. The descent from this pattern picked up steam,
especially with the extended black real body of April 15. The
next two sessions’ spinning tops gave a clue that the stock was
trying to stabilize. However, the new low close on April 17, and
then the low-price gapping play completing the next session,
showed the bears had regained complete control.

Observe how a small falling window in early May became
resistance. This resistance area was important to keep in mind
because there were bottoming signals with a hammer at 1 and
the bullish engulfing pattern at 2. A trader should be cautious
about buying on either these bullish signals because of the lim-
ited profit potential based on the window’s resistance.

Gapping Side-by-Side White Lines

In a rally, an upward-gapping white candle followed the next
session by another similar-sized white candle with about the
same opening is a bullish continuation pattern. This two-candle
pattern is referred to as upgap side-by-side white lines (see Exhibit
7.18).

There are rarer side-by-side white lines that gap lower. These
are called downgap side-by-side white lines (see Exhibit 7.19). In
spite of the dual white candles, it is still considered a bearish
signal because of the falling window. These white lines are
viewed as short covering. Once this short covering evaporates,
prices should move lower. The reason the downgap side-by-
side white line pattern is especially rare is because black can-
dles, not white candles, are more natural in a declining price
environment.

Although I have examples of these patterns in the following
exhibits, the candle lines that make the gapping side-by-side
white candles are not critical to remember. What is important is
the rising and falling windows that are part of these patterns.
As discussed in the tasuki pattern earlier in this chapter, I view
it as of minor consequence if there are two white candles (as
with the side-by-side patterns) or a black and white candle (as

with the tasuki) after the window. It is the window itself that
gives us the trend and the support or resistance area.

For example, in the downgap side-by-side white candles, it is
not surprising that this is a bearish signal in spite of the two
white candles. This is because it is the falling window of that
pattern that defines the trend (in this case, down). It would take
a close over the top of the falling window to negate the bearish
outlook of the downgap side-by-side white lines.

The moral of this story: It is not necessary to worry about
remembering the esoteric tasuki and gapping side-by-side
white lines. It is the window that is critical. The combination and
colors of the candle lines after a rising or falling window pat-
terns aren’t important. A falling window puts the trend down
and a rising window puts the trend up with the window as
support or resistance.

Exhibit 7.20 shows an upgap side-by-side white lines the
first two days in May. As discussed earlier, it’s not so much the
color of these white lines in the upgap side-by-side lines that
make this positive as much as the rising window that opened
on May 1.

Chapter 7 © Continuation Patterns

Because this chart has many examples of windows, I will dis-
cuss them individually.

1. A falling window at 1 keeps the trend down. This is in spite
of the fact that it was a hammer on March 26. Usually,
between the window and another pattern, I go with the win-
dow. In this case, it was between a bullish hammer and a
bearish falling window. The bearish outlook engendered by
the falling window takes precedence over the hammer. It
would take a close above the window to have the bullish out-
look hinted at by the hammer to be validated.

2. The small rising window at 2 became support on the minor
retracement from the dark-cloud cover of April 4 and 5. The
doji on April 10 (at the window’s support) showed two
things. The first was that the window at 2 held as support.
The second was that the stock was separating from its prior
downtrend that was evidenced by the three consecutive
black real bodies before the doji.

3. The rally that started with the successful defense of window
2 on April 10 stalled on April 23 as Platinum got to the resis-
tance area at $495 defined by the top of falling window 1.
The decline from this resistance opened a falling window at
3. The long black real body on April 25 followed by a small
real body inside that black real body formed a harami pat-
tern. This showed that the bears were losing their momen-
tum.

4. The rising window on May 1 followed by the two small
white real bodies. (This formed the aforementioned upward
gapping side-by-side white candle line pattern.)

After the upgap side-by-side white lines, it became a battle of
windows with the falling window at 3 as resistance (near
$488) and rising window at 4 near $475 as support. We can
see that for over a week the aforementioned support and
resistance areas held intact until April 17 when the demand
was strong enough to push the market over the falling win-
dow 3’s resistance on a close. (On April 14 the market
pushed over the window intraday but did not close above
it—thus keeping the window’s resistance intact.) From the
break of that resistance, the market ascended briskly until a
harami pattern on May 18 and 21 called an end to that rally.

EXHIBIT 7.22. Falling
Three Methods

RISING AND FALLING THREE METHODS

The three methods include the bullish rising three methods and
a bearish falling three methods. (Note how the number three
again makes an appearance.) These are both continuation pat-
terns. That is, the trend before the bullish rising three methods
should continue higher once the bullish three methods is com-
pleted. Likewise, a bear trend remains in effect after the bearish
falling three methods.
The rising three methods (see Exhibit 7.21) is composed of:

1. A long white candle.

2. The white candle is followed by a group of falling or lateral
small real body candles. The ideal number of small candles
is three but two or more than three are also acceptable if they
hold within the long white candle’s high-low range. Think
of the small candles as forming a pattern similar to a three-
day harami pattern since they hold within the first session’s
range. (For this pattern, that would include holding within
the shadows; for a true harami they would have to hold with
the real body.) The small candles can be either color, but
black is most ideal for this pattern.

3. The final day should be a strong white real body session with
a close above the first day’s close. The final candle line
should ideally also open above the close of the previous ses-
sion.

This pattern resembles the Western bull flag or pennant for-
mation. Yet the concept behind the rising three methods is from
the 1700s. The three methods pattern is considered a rest from
trading and a rest from battle. In more modern terms, the mar-
ket is, with the group of small candles, “taking a breather.”

The falling three methods pattern (see Exhibit 7.22) is the bear-
ish counterpart of the rising three methods pattern. For this pat-
tern, the market should be in a downtrend. A long black candle
is followed by about three small rising candles whose real bod-
ies hold within the first candle’s range (including shadows). The
final session should open under the prior close and then close
under the first black candle’s close. This pattern resembles a
bear flag or bear pennant formation.


--- 第 152 页 ---

Chapter 7 © Continuation Patterns

The ideal version of this pattern has the small real bodies as
the opposite color of the first long real body. That is, for a
bullish rising three methods, there should be small black real
bodies; and for the bearish falling three methods, three small
white real bodies. Nonetheless, from my experience, two and
up to five small real bodies work fine. Also, the small real bod-
ies can be any color.

The ideal rising three methods has three small black real bod-
ies within the entire trading range of a white real body. In
Exhibit 7.23 we see a bullish belt-hold on August 13. This is fol-
lowed by four small black real bodies and doji within the
August 13 high-low range. The close on August 21 completes
the rising three methods pattern.

The challenge we have with a rising three methods is from a
risk/reward aspect. By the time the rising three methods is com-
pleted, a stock might be far from its most recent lows. In such a
scenario, buying on the completion of the three methods may
not offer an attractive trade. As such, one should think of the
potential profit once the rising three methods is completed com-

pared to its risk (the risk being the low of the white candle that
started the rising three methods).

As shown in Exhibit 7.24 an extended black candle pushed
orange juice to a new low in the first week of October. The next
session, as orange juice got back above 69 cents, it showed that
the new lows made the prior week could not hold. As will be
seen in Chapter 11, when a market breaks a significant support
area (as this market did when it broke beneath the August—
September lows) and then fails to hold the new lows, it often
has bullish implications.

The tall white candle in the second week of November and
the following week’s small real bodies demonstrate hesitation
at resistance area from May toward 85 to 87 cents. A group of
small real bodies held within the range set by the second tall
white candle in November. With the tall white candle in
December, we had a rising three methods. (Remember, it is
acceptable for the shadows to get outside of the white candles’
trading range as long as the real small bodies remain in the
white candles’ trading range).

After this rising three methods, the market moved laterally
for the remainder of December until an extended white candle

after the doji (shown as 4) put the bulls back in charge. Some
may have noticed that area A on the chart looks very similar to
rising three methods since the real bodies at 1 to 4 held within
the white candle. Because the rising three methods should have
small real bodies, the long real body at 3 meant this was not
viewed as a rising three methods pattern.

In Exhibit 7.25 on May 30 and 31 as the stock was descend-
ing, it did so with a series of very small, almost doji, real bod-
ies. This makes the trend less negative. The April 1 bullish
engulfing pattern showed that the bulls had now taken control.
Some consolidation in the next four days with alternating black
and white small real bodies and the April 10 candle finalized
the rising three methods pattern.

Let’s look at an example of volume in conjunction with the
rising three methods. Ideally, with a rising three methods, the
first and last candles, ie., the long white, have the strongest
volume of all the sessions that make up the rising three meth-
ods. This would confirm that on each of the white candle days
the bulls had more control of the market. In Exhibit 7.26 the
June 17 tall white candle had relatively strong volume.

Additionally, this candle in conjunction with the prior two days
formed a morning doji star.

The series of small real bodies that drifted lower after the
June 17 white real body were on declining volume. The push
higher with a higher volume lofty white candle on June 24 com-
pleted the rising three methods. This chart is a classic example
of combining volume with a candlestick indicator that can rein-
force the likelihood of the candlestick indicator being success-
ful.

After the June 24 white candle, a black real body formed a lit-
tle dark-cloud cover and caused some temporary hesitation
before the rally resumed. Note also the high volume window
opened July 8. This high volume reinforced the likelihood that
the window, especially the bottom of the window, would
become a support area. (Volume is addressed in Chapter 15.)

In most instances, the rising three methods occur during an
uptrend or lateral trend. Sometimes, however, this pattern
helps define a turning point from a sell-off. Another example of
this pattern is shown in Exhibit 7.27. A rising three methods in
early September helped to underscore the solidity of support

near 7500. The market did not immediately rally after that ris-
ing three methods. While candle signals will often give market
turns, they do not necessarily mean that the market will ascend
(in the case of a rising three methods) immediately from that
signal. Instead, many candle patterns, such as this one, can
reinforce a support area. This is what unfolded with the Dow
near 7500 as support. Additional confirmation of that support
came with the piercing pattern in mid September and early
October and a hammer on October 4.

Where a candle pattern or line appears within the market
picture is often more important than the individual candle
pattern. For example, if there were a bullish engulfing pattern
that is completed near a resistance area, from a risk/reward
perspective it would not be attractive to purchase on that pat-
tern since one would be buying at resistance.

An example of the overall technical picture and a rising three
methods pattern is highlighted in Exhibit 7.28. A small window
between December 14 and 15 was support during the latter
part of that week. A rally that began on December 20 ran into
some problems near $60 with a harami pattern of December 23
and 27. On the close of December 29, the stock formed a rising

three methods pattern (it had two small real bodies instead of
the classic three small real bodies). But look where this pattern
was completed, at the $60 area—which was resistance since
December 7. Consequently, while the rising three methods is
considered a bullish signal, one should keep in mind that since
it emerged at a resistance area, it would not be an effective buy-
ing opportunity. It took the close above this $60 resistance area
on January 11 to get this market going on the upside.

Exhibit 7.29 shows a falling three methods pattern. Notice
that the first small real body of this pattern on May 18 was out-
side the real body of the prior long black real body. This does
not negate the falling three methods pattern since a requisite is
that the small real bodies should then be within the entire trad-
ing range of a long black candle, not necessarily in the black
candle’s real body.

The black real body on May 21, which closed under the close
of the May 17 black real body, fulfilled the conditions for the
falling three methods. A very impressive bounce on May 25 in
which the stock opened sharply lower and then closed about
unchanged from the prior session was almost a counterattack
pattern. Although the white candle’s close did not get exactly to

the May 24 close, the intense bounce from the opening to clos-
ing on the 25 would have the same implications as a classic
counterattack.

In Exhibit 7.30, WorldCom broke a multimonth support area
near $38 in the first week of August. A minor rally in early
August managed to put the stock back to the prior support area
of $38. From there it failed. (In Chapter 11, I examine this tech-
nique of old support becoming new resistance.) The price activ-
ity in September formed a falling three methods pattern.

SEPARATING LINES

We examined the counterattack line in Chapter 6. This is a
white/black or black/white combination of candle lines with
the same close as the previous close. Whereas the counterattack
line has the same close, the separating lines in Exhibit 7.31 have

the same open as the previous opposite color candle.
The separating line is a continuation pattern. It is easy to
see why. During a market rise, a black real body (especially a
relatively long one) would be a bull’s cause for concern. The
bears might be gaining control. However, if the next session’s
opening gaps high enough to open at the previous black ses-
sion’s opening price, it impressively proves that the bears
have lost control of the market—especially if that session
closes as a white candle. This is the scenario that unfolds with
the bullish separating line as shown in Exhibit 7.31. The white
line ideally should also be a bullish belt-hold (that is, open on
the low of the session and close at, or near, the high of the ses-
sion). The opposite would be true with a bearish separating
line in Exhibit 7.31. This is viewed as a bearish continuation

signal. Separating lines are rare.

While most of us would like to see an ideal version of a par-
i! ticular candle pattern, even variations of these patterns can also
] | prove useful. Exhibit 7.32 illustrates this. A bearish engulfing
, 1 i pattern in mid August (at B) presaged a decline that culminat-
| | | ed with a bullish engulfing pattern completed on August 3. The
Bullish 1, two lines following the August 3 white candle was almost a
*earsh bullish separating line. This is because the open on August 7
was almost the same as the prior day’s open, but not exactly.
Nonetheless, considering the stock closed at $46.25 on August

4 and then gapped sharply higher to open almost the same as
the August 4 opening was, undoubtedly, very impressive. If
one needed more bullish proof than this that demand had over-
whelmed supply, it came with the August 9 rising window.

In Exhibit 7.33 bearish separating lines occurred in the sec-
ond week of August. After these bearish separating lines, the
stock stabilized near the early August support area of $29.
Confirmation of a bearish down leg came with the falling win-
dow of August 15.

There were bullish separating lines on September 13 and 14.
These failed to correctly signal a continuation of the rally.
However, this should not be too surprising considering that the
white candle of the bullish separating lines came at $28. This
was a resistance area in place during the week of August 21, as
shown by the dashed line. Once again this underscores that
where one gets a candle signal is a major factor in deciding if
one buys or sells on that signal. In this example, if someone
bought on the completion of the bullish separating lines, that
trader would have purchased the stock at resistance. In such a

scenario it might be more prudent waiting for the stock to close
above $28 for further bullish confirmation.

Although the bullish separating lines are rare, they normally
appear during a rally. There are a few instances, however,
where a bullish separating line can help signal a bottom. In
Exhibit 7.34 a bullish separating line arose on March 24 and 25.
After this pattern the stock hesitated near $43.50. This market's
hesitation came to an end on April 5 as the stock opened a small
rising window above this $43.50 resistance.

Interestingly, the candle lines from March 25 to the afore-
mentioned gap on April 5 formed a high-price gapping play.
The April rally continued until the bearish engulfing pattern on
April 14 and 15.

A sudden danger.

s described in Chapter 3, a doji is a candle session where
the opening and closing prices are the same. Examples of
doji lines are shown in Exhibits 8.1 through 8.6. The doji is such
a significant reversal indicator that this chapter is devoted to its
manifestations. In prior chapters, we have seen the power of a
doji as a component of some patterns. These included the doji
star (see Chapter 5) and the harami cross (see Chapter 6).
The doji is a distinct trend change signal, especially during
rallies. The likelihood of a reversal with the emergence of a doji
increases if:

2. The market is overbought or oversold.

3. The market doesn’t have many doji (the plural of doji is doji).
If there are numerous doji on a particular chart, one should
not view the emergence of a new doji as a meaningful devel-
opment.

The ideal doji session has the same opening and closing
price, yet there is some flexibility to this rule. If the opening and
closing prices are within a few ticks of each other (for example,
a few cents in stocks or a few thirty-seconds in bonds, and so
on), the line could still be viewed as a doji. How do you decide
whether a near-doji day (that is, where the open and close are
very close, but not exact) should be considered a doji? This is
subjective and there are no rigid rules. Here are some tech-
niques I have found useful for saying that a doji-like session
would be reacted upon like a classic doji:

1. Compare a near-doji day in relation to recent action. If there
were a series of very small real bodies, the near-doji day
would not be viewed as significant since so many other
recent periods had small real bodies. If, however, a doji-like
session emerges among tall candles, then we can say that
such a session could have the same implications as a doji

se

since this session is displaying there is something very dif-
ferent on that session from the preceding action.

2. If the market is at an important market junction.

3. If the market is extremely overbought or oversold.

4. If there are other technical signals sending out an alert.

Since a doji can be a significant warning, it is better to attend
to a false warning than to ignore a real one.

This chapter will address doji at tops, doji as resistance, spe-
cific types of doji, doji and trend, and the tri-star.

Doji are valued for their ability to call market tops. This is
especially true after a long white candle in an uptrend (see
Exhibit 8.5). The reason for the doji’s potential negative impli-
cations in uptrends is because a doji represents indecision.
Indecision, uncertainty, or vacillation by buyers will not main-
tain a rally. It takes the conviction of buyers to sustain a rally. If
the market has had an extended rally, and/or is overbought,
and then a doji surfaces (read “indecision”), it could mean the
scaffolding of buyers’ support will give way.

A caveat, from my experience, is that as successful as doji are
at calling tops, they tend to lose some reversal potential in
downtrends. The reason may be that a doji reflects a balance
between buying and selling forces. With ambivalent market
participants, the market could fall, as the market saying goes,
“fall of its own weight.” This is similar to the idea that strong
volume is more important to confirm an upside breakout than
volume confirmation for a downside breakout.

Thus, a doji in a rally could signal an exhausted market. But
with a doji during a price descent, the market may continue its
fall. Because of this, doji need more confirmation to signal a
bottom than they do a top. For example, a doji that confirms
support should be heeded although it comes during a decline.

To separate a doji during a rally from doji during declines, I
call the former Northern doji and the latter Southern doji (see
Exhibit 8.6). This section will focus on Northern doji. Southern
doji (doji in a falling market) are addressed later in this chapter.

Keep in mind that doji not working so effectively at signaling
bottoms as tops is based on my experiences. The Japanese say,
“The market is like a person’s face; never are two alike.”
Consequently, for your markets, doji may work well at calling

bottoms. This brings out a pivotal point about candle charts in
general. All of the candle lines or patterns may be effective in
your markets, or only some. Seeing which work well comes
with experience.

THE NORTHERN DO})I
(DOJI DURING RALLIES)

The Japanese say that with a doji after a tall white candle, or a
doji in an overbought environment, that the market is “tired.”
That is a wonderfully apt way to view doji. A doji may not
mean an immediate price reversal. The doji shows us the mar-
ket is vulnerable, and may be at a transition point.

I received a letter from an attendee at one of my on-site insti-
tutional seminars. The attendee wrote, “You're right about a lit-
tle knowledge being dangerous. We are all running around
shouting ‘doji, doji, doji!’”” This comment is not surprising since
doji are so easy to spot. Traders may get so excited about seeing
a doji that they jump on it as a trading signal. But don’t make
more of the doji than it is meant to show. A doji means the trend
may be in the process of changing.

For example, in my advisory service, I provide short-term
trend. When a doji arises, I don’t change the market’s short-
term trend from up to down, but from up to up/neutral. If this
doji also confirms another technical signal, then I would change
the trend from up to neutral or neutral /down. (This idea of one
technical indicator confirming another is the focus of Part 2.) It
is rare that with a doji itself I would change the short-term
trend from up to down.

In Exhibit 8.7 the spinning tops at A and B were clues that the
trends before these candles were stalling. While such small real
bodies represent a tug-of-war between the buyers and sellers, a
doji is a session in which the bulls and bears are in complete
balance.

During the ascent from B a series of long white real bodies
echoed a vibrant market. The doji, in a single session, shows
that the market is separating from its trend. The doji indicates
that there is something very different on that day (in which the
open and close are the same) from the preceding white candle
lines where the closes were well above the openings.

Chapter 8 ¢ The Magic Doji 159

In this example, after the doji, the index went from up to lat-
eral and then down. However, the appearance of the doji
doesn’t necessarily mean the market will descend. Yet, the doji,
especially in such an overbought market, would be reason for
caution. Liquidating some long positions, selling calls, and
moving up stops are all examples of what could be done with
this doji session.

In Exhibit 8.8 the stock retreated from a bearish engulfing
pattern (at B). A few sessions later a lengthy white candle
showed that the bulls have taken control since that line closed
over the bearish engulfing pattern’s $58.50 resistance area. But
the next session’s doji changed the outlook. The market went
from one where the bulls were in charge to one where, as
shown by the doji, the forces of supply and demand were in
equilibrium.

Observe how the stock stalled a couple of sessions after the
doji neared $58.62. This brings out a useful technique I use fre-
quently with a doji following a tall white candle. Specifically, I

will take the highest high between the doji session and the tall
white candle (that is, the highest upper shadow). That level
should be resistance based on the close. In this example, the
high of the doji session and the long white candle were both
$58.62. At such, that becomes our resistance area.

In Exhibit 8.9 sessions 1 through 6 had higher highs, higher
lows, and higher closes. Session 7 was the first lower high,
lower close, and lower low since candle line 1. Normally this is
not of great consequence, but since candle 7 was also a dojj, it
adds more importance to this aspect. Sometimes the small clues
add up to signal an important market juncture. As the Japanese
proverb says, “The water of even a great ocean comes one drop
at a time.” So it is in the markets, where small clues that are not
meaningful by themselves take on more weight when com-
bined with other technical clues.

The dashed line on the chart is our resistance area once the
doji emerged. As explained in Exhibit 8.8, if we have a doji
after a tall white candle, we take the highest high between
those two lines and make that resistance based on the close. In

this chart, since the white candle line had a higher high than
the doji’s high, that becomes our prime resistance area (shown
by the dashed line). With the appearance of the doji, Intel had
become “tired.” If Intel had closed over that resistance line,
we would say that the market is refreshed and it would be a
bullish breakout.

THE LONG-LEGGED DOJI (RICKSHAW MAN),
THE GRAVESTONE DO}JI, AND THE
DRAGONFLY DO)!

As shown in Exhibits 8.2 to 8.4, some doji have nicknames
depending on if the open/close (i.e., the horizontal component
of the doji) is at the low or high of the session or if there are
unusually long upper and lower shadows on the doji.

Acandle line with long upper and lower shadows and a small
real body is called a high-wave candle." If such a candle line is a
doji instead of a small real body, then it is called a long-legged doji
(see Exhibit 8.2). It also has the nickname rickshaw man.


--- 第 170 页 ---

oe
162 Part 1 © The Basics

The doji portion of the long-legged doji shows the market is
at a transition point. The long upper shadow shows the market
had rallied during the session, but by session’s end had backed
off from these highs. The extended lower shadow visually
depicts a market that had sold off during the session; by ses-
sion’s end it had been able, by the close, to recoup some of its
lost ground. In other words, the market rallies, sells off, rallies,
etc. It is a confused market. These long shadows hint, as the
Japanese say, “The market has lost its sense of direction.” As
such, a long-legged doji is an indication of a market separating
from its trend.

The gravestone doji (see Exhibit 8.3) is another distinctive doji.
It develops when the open, low, and close are at the low of the
day. This line is an example of how visually intuitive candles
are. Even if you never saw an explanation of the gravestone
doji, just by looking at it, would you think it was a bullish or
bearish signal? Of course, the answer is bearish. With its
extended upper shadow and close at the low of the session, we
can graphically see that at some time during the session the
stock had rallied and by session’s end the bears dragged this
stock down to the lows at the close. It can be viewed as the ulti-
mate shooting star. The shooting star has a long upper shadow
and small real body. If the shooting star’s real body becomes a
doji, then we have a gravestone doji.

The gravestone’s forte is in calling tops. The shape of the
gravestone doji makes its name appropriate. As we have dis-
cussed, many of the Japanese technical terms are based on mil-
itary analogies. In Japanese candlestick literature it is said that
the gravestone doji represents the gravestone of the bulls that
have died defending their territory.

The dragonfly doji is the bullish counterpart of the gravestone
doji. The dragonfly has the open/close at the highs of the ses-
sion. This means the market had touched much lower lows
during the session, but had impressively managed to close at,
or very close to, the highs. This is like the hammer, but the ham-
mer has a small real body where the dragonfly doji has no real
body since it is a doji.

In Exhibit 8.10 a long-legged doji appeared on October 23. By
using the highest high between the doji and the prior white
candle, we immediately obtain resistance near $88. The index

descended from this long-legged doji until the hammer three
days later. In early November the market was ascending, but
the two long-legged doji put a damper on any bullish outlook.
A further sign of trouble emerged with the November 6 and 7
bearish engulfing pattern. Note how in the early part of
October the stock was falling with doji during this descent. As
previously discussed, doji, based on my experience, work bet-
ter at calling tops reversals than bottom reversals.

An example of a gravestone doji is shown in Exhibit 8.11.
Since the doji’s high was the same as the prior session, it is also
a tweezers top. As ominous as “gravestone” sounds, please
don’t make the mistake of thinking it implies a large move
lower. While the gravestone doji, because of its extended upper
shadow and close at the session low, does increase the chances
for a turn, it doesn’t forecast the extent of a potential decline.
Candle signals are unexcelled for spotting the early reversals,
not to predict the extent of a move. Don’t make more out of can-
dles than they are designed to provide. As the Japanese adage
goes, “Don’t climb a tree to catch a fish.”

EXHIBIT 8.11. Inktomi—15 Minutes (Gravestone Doji)

Although that doji was a reason for caution, I would not have
turned outright bearish on that gravestone doji. Why? Notice
how the close of that doji was still over the late March 22 resis-
tance area near $224. It would take the close on the session after
the gravestone to turn the trend south. That session, with its
close back under $224, proved what the doji had hinted at—
that the new highs couldn’t hold.

In Exhibit 8.12 some long-legged doji in mid April signaled
that the prior downtrend was losing momentum near $6.75.
The rally in early May made a rising window. But there was a
problem on the day of the rising window on May 9: It was
another long-legged doji. This signified that the bulls were not
in complete control. The window’s support was broken the day
after this long-legged doji. This confirmed the potential for
another down draft. When the stock got near the aforemen-
tioned $6.75 support area from mid April on May 23, it suc-
cessfully defended it with a hammer. The rally from this ham-
mer made two windows at 1 and 2. The stock corrected from
the bearish engulfing pattern at B. The decline from this bear-

ish engulfing pattern found stabilization near $8.75 to $8.25
with a series of dragonfly doji. Since the third dragonfly didn’t
have the open/close at the high, but near it, I view it as a vari-
ation of the dragonfly doji. These dragonfly doji confirmed
support at the windows at 1 and 2. Final confirmation of the
support came with the June 28 hammer.

The general concept with doji (and for all candle signals) is
that one should look at what happened before the signal. For
instance, a doji in a rally is a potential reversal. Therefore, there
needs to be a rally to reverse. This means that doji have little
forecasting implications if they are in a trading range environ-
ment since there is no trend to reverse. The Japanese aptly call
a market that is locked within a range a “box.”

The doji in Exhibit 8.13 is reflecting on a micro scale what the
trading range environment on a more macro aspect is showing:
The market is undecided. With no trend to change, the doji in
Exhibit 8.13 has no forecasting implications, except for the fact
that it is confirming a trendless environment. An exception to
this is if a doji, while still in a trading range, is at the top or bot-

tom end of a range. As such, it is confirming resistance or sup-
port and could be a useful signal.

In Exhibit 8.14 let’s look at three doji in relation to their pre-
ceding trend. Doji 1 is in the middle of a box range.
Consequently, this doji doesn’t have any forecasting implica-
tions since there’s no trend to reverse. The same scenario is true
with the dragonfly doji at 2. The doji at 3 is very different
because of where it appears. This doji comes after a rally that
placed the stock into an overbought condition. As such it has
reversal implications. The two doji following doji 3 are echoing
what the first doji at 3 told us—that the stock was running out
of bullish force. To recap: Where the doji is in relation to its pre-
ceding trend is of pivotal importance.

Exhibit 8.15 illustrates a point alluded to previously in this
chapter: Doji. during descents (what I call Southern doji) often do
not work well as bottom turning signals. In this chart doji, or
doji-like lines A to F, appeared during a market decline. But these
Southern doji did not signal any reversals. The first sign of a turn
came with the tall white candle on March 3 wrapping around the
two previous doji lines at F. This formed a bullish engulfing pat-

tern that held as support. (There was also a small bullish engulf-
ing pattern at time frame C, but once the black candle closed
under the low of that pattern, the hopes for a bottom were negat-
ed.) An indication that the rally from the bullish engulfing pat-
tern at F was stalling came with the doji like line at 1.

In Exhibit 8.16, I have a series of doji illustrating how differ-
ent market surroundings influence a doji’s importance. Let’s
look at each individually.

¢ Doji 1. “An earthquake of magnitude 8” is how the Japanese
would describe the action preceding doji 1. Two forceful
black real bodies are followed by equally intense long white
candles that made up all the lost ground of those black can-
dles. The doji at 1 showed the stock was separating from its
trend (in this case the trend was up because of the two long
white candles). As is the case for a doji and tall white candle,
we use the highest high of these two sessions (in this exam-
ple, it is the high of the white candle at 3745) as resistance.
This resistance held on the next session.

EXHIBIT 8.16. NASDAQ Composite—5 Minutes (Doji)

Doji 2. This doji came after a short-term decline. (Even if
there are a few down sessions before the doji, I still view the
immediately preceding trend as down.) Therefore, as a doji
in a downtrend, it warrants less attention as a turning signal.

Doji 3. This doji came after a tall white candle. As such, it
does hint the rally that started from 3705 could be losing its
steam. However, is the stock overbought when this doji
arose? In my opinion, it wasn’t (compare this to doji 1 that
came after an intense vertical rally). Consequently, this doji
has less meaning than it would in an overbought environ-
ment. Once the market closed over the doji, it negated any of
its potentially bearish implications.

Doji 4. Doji 4 arose within a lateral price environment. Since
there was no preceding trend to reverse (the doji was in a box
range), it has less significance as a turning signal. One useful
aspect of this doji was that it helped reinforce the resistance
area defined by the bearish engulfing pattern built a few ses-
sions earlier.

¢ Doji 5. A Southern doji. Since it did not confirm any other
bottoming signals, it is not important.

© Doji 6. Same as doji 5.

¢ Doji 7. This doji shows how candle lines and patterns must
be viewed in the context of the price activity before that pat-
tern. This doji came after a downtrend. Normally, as detailed
with doji 2, 5, and 6, 1 would not view a southern doji as a
visual warning of a bottom. However, in the context of the
overall market picture, this doji takes on more significance
since it was confirming support. There was a bullish engulf-
ing pattern at B at 3680 and the hammer on the session before
doji 7 told us the market was building a base near 3680-3682.
That is why this Southern doji at 7 takes on extra conse-
quence, even though it comes after a decline. It was confirm-
ing the dual support area at the bullish engulfing pattern and
hammer.

Let’s look at Exhibit 8.17 to understand why doji should not
be viewed in isolation. This doji following a tall white candle

was also a new high close for the move. Doji or not, anew high
close is a plus. Many traders use “line charts” that are based
solely on the close. The media will say that the stock closed at
a new high. Many Western indicators (moving averages, oscil-
lators, etc.) are keyed on the close. As such, a new high close
keeps the trend up. With this in mind, I normally suggest that
if there is a doji, that is also a new high close for the move to
wait for bearish confirmation of the doji. This confirmation
would be a close the next session under the doji’s close. In this
example, we got that bearish confirmation with the next ses-
sion’s close. That black candle day was also a failure at our
resistance area defined by the doji’s resistance area near $45.50.

THE TRI-STAR

The tri-star is a very rare reversal pattern. As shown in Exhibit
8.18, the tri-star is formed by three doji lines at a new high for
the move. For my candle-charting research, I followed a rule
before revealing a pattern or signal: It had to be corroborated
by at least two independent sources. This helped confirm the
tried-and-true techniques and helped avoid the hundreds of
possible patterns that anyone can think of. (This is why I warn
traders to be careful about other sources of candle-charting
information.)

This tri-star is an exception to my rule of corroboration. I got
this from a single source. It came from a Japanese trader who
used candle charts all his professional career. More important,
he told me his father had found this particular pattern decades
ago and successfully used it. My feeling is that a pattern with
this much history deserved to be included.

The ideal tri-star top has three doji (remember that the plural
of doji is also doji) with the middle doji higher than the first and
second doji. (This is reminiscent of the Western head and shoul-
ders top, where the head is higher than the left and right shoul-
ders.) In Exhibit 8.19, there are dual hammers during the week
of January 3. This built a foundation for a rally that gave a hint
that it was exhausting itself via the doji on January 10. After this
doji, Honeywell settled into a mostly lateral range, but in doing
so formed a tri-star top. Although this stock fell steeply after
the tri-star top, it should be remembered that candle charts do

PUTTING IT ALL

E0¢Mtbnire ss

The water of even a great ocean comes one drop at a time.

n Part 1 of this book, I examined many candle lines and for-

mations. This chapter is a visual summary. The following
chart has numbered lines and patterns. All are candle indica-
tors that have been discussed previously. How would you
interpret them? If necessary, use the visual Japanese candle
glossary at the back of the book to help you with your inter-
pretations.

Remember, the following interpretations are subjective. You
may see different indicators from those I did, or some that I did
not. As with any charting technique, different experiences will
give different perspectives. There are no concrete rules, just
general guidelines. For example, what if a hammer-like line

had a lower shadow only one and one-half times the height of
the real body instead of the more ideal version with a lower
shadow twice—or even three times—the height of the real
body? A purist might say this was not a hammer and ignore it.
Others may cover shorts on such a line. Still others might wait
for the next session to see what unfolds.

“To hear it told is not equal to experience” is a Japanese
proverb. I can relay basic candle charting techniques, but it will
be only through your experience with these tools, in your mar-
kets, that you will unravel the candles’ full potential.

Exhibit 9.1 illustrates the following patterns and lines.

1. A long upper shadow candle. This is a very small clue of the
bulls’ hesitation since one session’s long upper shadow
doesn’t change the directional bias of the market. There is
also not enough history yet to see if the market is over-
bought.

2. The shooting star is now confirming potential resistance at
the aforementioned long upper shadow candle at 1.

--- 第 182 页 ---

Chapter 9 © Putting It All Together 175

3. Yet another long upper shadow candle. Three days of bear-
ish upper shadows from the same highs is certainly enough
reason to stand up and take notice. The candle has the same
shape as a shooting star (that is, a long upper shadow and
small real body at the bottom end of the trading range);
however, a shooting star should come after an ascending
market. Here the market was trading laterally. As such,
while I would not view this as a shooting star, the candle’s
long upper shadow is cause for concern since it is confirm-
ing trouble at the shooting star at 2.

4. A falling window further reinforces the bearishness hinted
at by the long upper shadows at 1, 2, and 3.

5. A small piercing pattern may be some cause for optimism.
However, in the context of the overall technical picture, the
piercing pattern was completed at a resistance area as
defined by the falling window in 4. As such, if one buys
because of this piercing pattern, the trader is buying at resis-
tance. An extended black real body after this piercing pat-
tern puts the bears back in domination.

6. A hammer at 6 hints that the bears’ momentum may be
slackening. For the next few days the market was stabilizing
as the low of the hammer held as support—that is, until:

7. The long black real body that closed under the low of the
hammer. This turned the trend southward again. This also
completed a bearish falling three methods pattern.

8. A falling window added more bearish momentum. The doji
on June 10, which opened this window, gave a minor sug-
gestion that the bears are losing some momentum. But doji
normally don’t work satisfactorily in downtrends as they do
in rallies. Additionally, the market now has the hurdle of the
falling window as resistance with which to contend.

9. Another long black real body whose upper shadow validat-
ed the falling windows resistance from the prior day. On
June 14, the market very impressively gapped higher on the
open (compared with the prior session’s close) and managed
to hold these higher levels into the close of the session. The
two sessions on June 11 and June 14 were a harami pattern.
This neutralized some of the bearish force from the June 11
candle. However, the falling window from 8 is still in force

as illustrated by a long upper shadow session on June 16
whose high was within the window’s resistance near 114°/4.

The June 17 tall white candle finally pushed this market
above the window’s resistance. This turned the trend more
positive. Note also how each session since the June 11 long
black candle had higher highs and higher lows.

A small black real body was the first lower high in many
sessions. Additionally, the diminutive black real body,
inside the prior extended white candle, completed a harami
pattern. This hinted that the bulls were losing their breath.
The market descended steadily from there.

The lower shadow of this candle was holding support at the
June 11 low near 113.25 and as such provided a small hope
that the market was trying to stabilize.

Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on whether
you're long or short), this candle line made a new low for
the move, both on an intraday and closing basis. It looked
like bears were in control until:

A doji that was a double plus. First, as a doji within the prior
black real body, it formed a harami cross. More important,
the close back above 113.25 showed that the lows made the
prior day could not be maintained. This would likely lead
shorts to second-guess themselves and give encouragement
to those looking to buy.

This white candle gave further bullish impetus to this mar-
ket because, by wrapping around the prior small real body,
it formed a bullish engulfing pattern.

The rally from 15 continued unchecked until the small real
body on July 1 made a harami pattern. Interestingly, this
harami pattern, with its extended long white candle and
small black real body, emerged at the same area and looked
similar to the harami pattern a few weeks before at candle
lines 10 and 11.

The descent from the harami at 16 visually depicted that the
bears did not have complete control since the minor decline
came with a series of bullish long lower shadow candles.
These candles also had small real bodies.

18. Another long white candle (a.k.a bullish belt-hold line) at
the same area where another tall white candle appeared on
June 30 gave a foundation for rally. There was another small
black real body the session after this tall white candle. This
small black real body following a tall white real body was
reminiscent of what happened with candle lines 10 and 11
and with a harami at 16. The difference was that this small
black real body (on July 19) was not within the prior tall
white candle. As such, it did not form a harami as was the
case with candle lines 10, 11, and 16. Also, since the black
real body on July 9 did not get deeply into the prior white
real body, it was not a dark-cloud cover.

19. During this time frame, the market was hovering near its
highs of the move. But these small real bodies and the bear-
ish long upper shadows conveyed a sense that the market
was separating from its prior uptrend. This hesitation is not
surprising since 117 was a resistance defined by the falling
window in late May as previously discussed at 4.

20. The white candle wrapping around the black real body has
the correct combination of candle lines to form a bullish
engulfing pattern. However, this was not a bullish engulf-
ing pattern because that pattern, as a bottom turning signal,
must come after a price decline.

21. The white candle on July 26 opening lower and then closing
unchanged from the prior session was a bullish counterat-
tack line. This turned the trend less bearish.

22. The two small white real bodies that gapped slightly higher
from the July 26 candle formed an upgap side-by-side white
candle lines. This was another positive indicator.

23. The August 2 candle broke support at the small rising win-
dow between July 26 and July 27. In spite of the break of the
support, this August 2 candle made a hammer. This provid-
ed potential support near 114 (the hammer’s low), which
was confirmed the following day vis-a-vis a dragonfly doji.

24. Although the August 2 candle broke the hammer’s support
intraday, by session’s end it had managed to close above the
support area and formed a bullish engulfing pattern.

25. An extended black real body took steam out of the market,
but it managed to maintain the support from the low of the

bullish engulfing pattern at 24. The following session,
August 19, this support was broken. However, the market
was now approaching the major support set in the latter
part of June in the 113-112.75 area. As such, the trend is
down. The market is near support, but there are no turning
signals yet.

26. An inverted hammer gives a very tentative clue that the
support near 113 might hold. Nonetheless, because of the
bearish shape of the inverted hammer, one needs to wait for
bullish confirmation the next session with the close over the
inverted hammer’s real body to become even marginally
positive. This confirmation came:

27. With a hammer.

28. The white real body of August 13 completed a bullish
engulfing pattern. Consequently, with the inverted hammer
at 26, the hammer at 27, and this bullish engulfing pattern,
we got strong visual reinforcement that June’s support near
113 was rock solid.

29. The doji after the tall white candle would be a sign for a bit
of caution. But, as addressed in Chapter 8, a prime consid-
eration with a doji after a tall white candle (or for any can-
dle signal) is whether the market is overbought or oversold.
Obviously, with this doji marginally off the recent lows, I
would not view this market as being overbought. Hence,
this doji has less implication as a sign of turn.

30. The group of spinning tops throughout the latter part of the
week of August 16 put the trend from up to neutral. The
close via a white candle on August 24 completed a rising
three methods pattern. This pattern formed with the can-
dles from August 17 through August 24.

31. This doji (the real body is so small that, to me, it is the same
as a classic doji) shows the importance of looking at the
overall technical picture. This doji appears in a more over-
bought environment than the doji at 29. Consequently, the
doji at 31 would be viewed as more consequential than the
doji at 29.

32. Because the doji at 31 was still hovering near its highs, I
would prefer further bearish confirmation to buttress the
potential turning signal of this doji. This confirmation came

with this black real body that closed under the doji’s close.
This black real body formed an evening star pattern.

This tiny falling window kept the bearish momentum
intact. There was a minor plus, however. This September 2
candle still maintained the pivotal support near 112.75-113
in force since the latter part of June.

A tall white candle that opened almost at the same opening
as the prior candle. As such, this could be viewed as a sep-
arating line. This gave cause for optimism that the support
near 113 was continuing to be solidly sustained. However,
the next day’s black candle and failure to maintain this
momentum short-circuited any bullish optimism.

A relatively long black real body keeps the bias lower, but
the bulls still have hope since the 112.75-113 support area is
still being sustained.

Asmall white real body that gets above the close of the prior
black real body helps reinforce support near 113. This is not
a piercing pattern since that pattern requires the close of the
white real body be more than the middle of the prior black
real body.

The doji on September 16 opened a very small rising win-
dow. Because the market was not overextended, we would
not view this doji as a cautionary signal, especially since
there is potential support at the rising window in the doji
session. Next session, however, the support at the rising
window was penetrated.

Using the lows from some of the candle lines from
September 14 to 23, we can now obtain a rising support line.
This aspect of combining the power of trend lines on candle
charts, as well as integrating many other Western technical
signals, is the focus of Part 2.

andle methods by themselves are a valuable trading tool.

But these techniques become even more powerfully signif-
icant if they confirm one or more Western technical signals.
This is where my principle of “convergence” comes in.

I define convergence as “a cluster of technical signals con-
verging at, or near, the same price.” Convergence is a pivotal
concept. This is because the more signals that join at a support
or resistance area, the more likely a reversal. The area of con-
vergence can be confirmed by a series of candle patterns or
Western signals or a combination of both.

Remember when as a kid you grabbed some crayons and
went crazy with a coloring book? Each page was a black-and-
white sketch of a beach or outer space scene. Your choice of col-
ors gave the picture your own personal touch. Likewise, based
on your trading style and personality, you likely have your
favorite tools and techniques. But whichever Western tools you
use, candles should be a part of your trading arsenal.

While I believe candle charts will replace bar charts as the
charts of choice, this does not mean I recommend ignoring the
tools used on bar charts such as trend lines, moving averages,
oscillators, etc. Indeed, I strongly suggest using classic Western
technical tools on candle charts. Here are some reasons:

1. Candle charting techniques are a tool, not a system: As such, they
should always be used in conjunction with other technical
indicators. This is a major advantage of candle charts: Since
they use the same data as a bar chart—that is, the open, high,
low, and close—you can use all your favorite Western tools
on the candle chart. This includes anything as basic as trend
lines and moving averages to the more esoteric Elliott Wave.
If a candle signal, i.e., a hammer, confirms a Western signal,
say a trend line, this convergence of indicators would
increase the likelihood of a reversal. As such, candle signals
become even more powerfully significant if they confirm a
Western technical signal.

2. Price targets: Candle charts provide many useful trading sig-
nals, especially early reversal signals. They do not, however,
provide price targets. This is where measured moves—look-
ing for prior support and resistance areas, retracements,
trend lines, and other Western clues—are used.


--- 第 189 页 ---

en ———————————
Part 2 © Convergence 183

3. Be aware of what the competition is using: Since so many traders
and analysts use technical analysis, it often has a major influ-
ence on the market. As such, it is important to be alerted to
technical signals others may be using, including Western
technical indicators.

Chapter 10 illustrates how a “cluster of candles” can dramat-
ically magnify the significance of a support or resistance area.
For the remaining chapters in Part 2, the focus will be on
Western tools, especially combined with candle charting sig-
nals. Chapter 11 addresses the many techniques one can utilize
with trend lines. For example, a failure to hold above a broken
resistance line or below broken support line can provide impor-
tant market signals. Chapter 12 looks at retracements and the
importance of waiting for confirmation of a retracement level
with a candlestick signal. Then, in Chapter 13 we look at the
value added of moving averages, especially when combined
with candlestick signals. Chapter 14 discusses oscillators
including stochastics, the relative strength index, and others,
and their usefulness when integrated with candle chart signals.
Chapter 15 focuses on what I consider one of the most impor-
tant weapons in a trader’s arsenal (besides candles)—volume.
The focus in Chapter 16 is on price targets and measured
moves. This is especially important since candle charts, while
giving reversal signals, do not provide price targets. Finally,
Chapter 17 brings it all together by showing how a plethora of
Eastern and Western technical tools converged and sent many
warning signals of a reversal in the NASDAQ.

Since the focus of this book isn’t Western technicals, but can-
dle charts and using candles to supplement traditional Western
technical techniques, I have only touched on the basics of
Western technical tools. There are many fine books that provide
much more detail on these Western techniques. An excellent
source of material can be found at www.TradersLibrary.com.

My quarter-century of experience with Western technicals
has been mainly the classic Western indicators. Sentiment indi-
cators such as advance/decline lines, the ARMS/TRIN index,
specialist short sales, and so on are not included. This is only
because of my limitations in knowledge, not because of limita-
tion of these tools. For example, while I don’t cover point and
figure charts, traders who specialize in this charting method

have told me they use candle charts to get the reversal signals
and then shift into point and figure charts to get their price tar-
gets. This is an example of using the tools and techniques of
candles as a complementary tool, no matter your technical spe-
cialty. Western techniques, when joined with candles, can be a
powerfully efficient combination.

THE MARKET IS NEVER WRONG

To convey in my Western technical seminars the importance of a dis-
ciplined approach to trading, | use the word “DISCIPLINE” as an ana-
gram. For each letter of the word DISCIPLINE | offer a trading rule.
For the letter “N," my rule is “Never trade in the belief the market is
wrong.”"

What do'l mean by the expression "the market is never wrong”? It
means do not try to impose your beliefs on the market. For example,
if you are firmly convinced the NASDAQ is going to rally, wait until
the trend is heading: north before buying. Say the NASDAQ is in a
bear market. If you buy in the expectation that a‘ bull market will

“materialize, you are then trying to impose your hopes and expecta-
tions on the market. You are fighting the trend. This could be disas-
trous. You may ultimately be correct in your bullish viewpoint, but by
then it may be too late. As an analogy, imagine. you are driving along
a one-way street. You notice a steamroller going down this one-way
street the wrong way. You stop your. car, take out.a sign (that you

~ always carry with you) that re ad “Stop! Wrong Way!” and hold it in

A CLUSTER OF
CANDLES

Add caution to caution.

Te: chapter explores how a group, or a cluster, of candle
lines and/or patterns that converge at the same price area
can magnify the importance of that area as support or resis-
tance and increase the likelihood of a market turn.

Exhibit 10.1 illustrates how a group of separate candle sig-
nals converged near $75 and, in doing so, underscored the
solidity of the support at that area. Let’s look at each signal
individually:

1. The extremely long white candle on April 17 that wrapped
around the prior black real body formed a bullish engulfing
pattern. Since the white candle in this bullish engulfing pat-

tern was so large, it meant that by the time the engulfing pat-
tern was completed, the stock was nearly $25 off its lows. As
such, while the bullish engulfing pattern gave us a reversal
signal, the close of that pattern may not have presented an
attractive area to buy based on the risk/reward aspect of
such a trade.

2. Remembering the concept that the low of the bullish engulf-
ing pattern can become support, we turn our attention to the
lows of this pattern near $73 as potential support. The
downdraft that started during the week of April 17 stabilized
near this expected support area with this long-legged doji.

3. The May 22 hammer reinforced the aforementioned support
area.

4, The two sessions after the hammer at 3 completed a classic
piercing pattern with the low of that pattern bouncing off the
support area defined by the bullish engulfing pattern at 1.

5. If further proof of a bottom was needed, it came at 5 with the
small rising window in late May. Additionally, if one looks at

the action from the week of May 15 through the week of May
29, the stock was building a rounding bottom. By adding the
window (at 5) to this rounding bottom, we have a frypan
bottom.

Exhibit 10.2 displays how a confluence of candles can help
pinpoint support or resistance.

° A cluster of candles as support: There was a hammer on
December 11. In spite of this hammer’s potentially bullish
implications, the falling window that opened on the day of
the hammer kept the trend down. As the market descended
from this hammer, it did so with a series of three long lower
shadows. These long lower shadows offset some of the bear-
ishness. The candle line at 1 was also a hammer, but unlike
the first hammer, discussed above, during the next two days,
December 16 and 17, this hammer successfully held as sup-
port. The two candles at 2 made a bullish engulfing pattern.

Another hammer emerged at 3 in early February. This was
the support area defined by 1 and 2. The dragonfly doji at 4
was further confirmation of support near $42.

A cluster of candles as resistance: As the stock was ascending
during A, it did so via a series of long upper shadows.
Because of the higher highs, higher lows, and higher closes,
the short-term trend remained up, but the long upper shad-
ows were a warning signal that the bulls did not have a com-
plete foothold on the stock. The last long upper shadow can-
dle on January 6 was a shooting star. A few days later, at B,
the stock formed a bearish engulfing pattern. At C the small
black real body in the tall white real body formed a harami
pattern. As such, the shooting star at A, the bearish engulfing
pattern at B, and the harami at C gave us a convergence of
candles that underscored the ceiling between $47.50 and $48.

Candle charts are a very efficient form of visual analysis. This
is because one can use them to pick up very quick pictorial

clues about the market’s health, or lack thereof. Simply by look-
ing at the shape of the individual candle lines we can rapidly
see the demand/supply situation. With this in mind, let’s look
at Exhibit 10.3.

In mid to late March a series of shooting stars defined resis-
tance toward $34.50. Looking at this group of shooting stars,
would there be any doubt about the trouble this stock is having
near $34.50? Of course not, since the shooting stars are graphi-
cally highlighting that each time the stock gets near its session
highs, the bears drag down prices to close the stock at or near
the lows of the day. In late August, there is another assault at
these shooting stars’ resistance. Once again, there appears
another shooting star overhead on this August rally. Adding to
this shooting star’s negative indication is the next day’s black
real body, which completes a bearish engulfing pattern.

CANDLES WITH
TREND LINES

fd 2H TITHE L

A prudent man has more than one string to his bow.

T:: chapter examines candle techniques in conjunction
with trend lines, breakouts from trend lines, false break-
outs, and uses of penetrated support and resistance areas.
Exhibit 11.1 shows a classic rising support line. It is obtained
by connecting two, and preferably three, or more reaction lows.
When drawing rising support lines on candle charts, I use the
bottom of the lower shadows as my connecting points. This
ascending line demonstrates that buyers are more aggressive
than sellers since demand is stepping in at higher lows. There
is a saying that there are more buyers than sellers. Since a trade
requires both a buyer and seller, I prefer to think of it as not

EXHIBIT 11.1. Rising

EXHIBIT 11.2. Falling
Support Line

more buyers than sellers, but more aggressive buyers than sell-
ers.

Exhibit 11.2 shows a falling support line. The traditional sup-
port line, as discussed in Exhibit 11.1, is derived by connecting
higher lows. The line in Exhibit 11.2 joins lower lows. The
falling line’s usefulness comes into play because there will be
many instances in which prices rebound from this descending
line.This line gives us a potential support area when none may
exist. A situation where there may be no evident support is
when a market makes either a low for the move or an all-time
low.

A regular rising support line, since it is ascending, is consid-
ered bullish. The falling support line, because the market is
making lower lows, can be considered as a bearish support line.
As such, bounces from this line are likely to be only marginal
and temporary. Yet, it can be an area to consider buying, espe-
cially if there is a convergence of technical indicators at that
line.

A piercing pattern appears early on the morning of
November 22 in Exhibit 11.3. After a minor rally from this
piercing pattern, the market retreated to the $62.50 area at
around 12:30-13:00. By connecting the lows of the piercing pat-
tern to the lows near $62.50 made a few hours later, we obtain
a rising support line. This line intersected late in the session of
November 22 where we see a variation of the piercing pattern.
(It’s a variation because the close of the white candle did not get
above the middle of the prior black candle.) This is an example
of how a less-than-ideal pattern can still provide a turning sig-
nal. Specifically, while this was not an ideal piercing pattern, it
helped increase its importance because it came at a rising sup-
port line. Further reinforcement that the bulls had taken control
came immediately after the successful test of this rising support
line via a rising window that became support early on
November 24.

Throughout January in Exhibit 11.4, Amazon was in down-
trend as gauged by the lower lows. Joining the lows at L1 and
L2 provides a tentative support line. Solidifying the importance
of this descending support line was another successful defense
at L3. The lows at L4 were a successful test of this downward
sloping support line and a bullish piercing pattern. The rally

from this piercing pattern opened a rising window on February
2 and 3. While the bottom of this window held as support, the
rally was short-circuited with the doji (which was also a shoot-
ing star) after the long white candle on February 9.

A descending falling support line in Exhibit 11.5 commenced
with the two lows at A and B and then the bullish engulfing
pattern at C. The last test of this line came in March at D fol-
lowed by an inverted hammer. The day after this inverted ham-
mer, a white candle formed a bullish engulfing pattern. Indeed,
if the white candle of the bullish engulfing pattern had a high-
er close, it would have formed a morning star. Nonetheless, the
convergence of the inverted hammer, the bullish engulfing pat-
tern, and the falling support line shouted “Cover shorts!”

Exhibit 11.6 displays a typical falling resistance line. It is
derived by joining at least two reaction highs; three or more
would give the line more clout. It shows that sellers are more
aggressive than buyers as evidenced by the sellers’ willingness

Chapter 11 ¢ Candles with Trend Lines

to sell at lower highs. This reflects a market that is trending
lower. With a resistance line on the candle charts, we connect
the tops of the upper shadows.

A regular resistance line is made with a series of lower highs.
But what if the market is at an all-time high and there are no
former highs from where we can peg a potential resistance
area? In this instance I frequently use a rising resistance line. As
shown in Exhibit 11.7, this is built by linking a series of higher
highs (instead of the falling resistance line’s lower highs).

In Exhibit 11.8 we join areas 1, 2, and 3 to obtain a classic
resistance line. At the bottom of the decline that started from
the harami at area 2, silver produced two high-wave candle
lines. This was the first indication that the downward power of
the market was dissipating. The rising window that opened
between March 6 and 7 then turned the trend up. The window
immediately became support as evidenced by the following
few days’ action.

Now that there were turning signals with the candle charts,
we can shift to the Western technicals a la the resistance line to
get a price target. This becomes the potential resistance area as

shown by the market stalling there the week of March 13. This
chart underscores why one needs Western technical tools, even
if the main focus is on candles. The candles can give the earli-
est turning signals, while the Western tools can give a price
objective and stop-out area.

A new high close via a tall white candle in Exhibit 11.9 on
April 12 (at 2) keeps the bull trend in force. The next day the
whole tone of the market had been transformed as a small black
real body which completed the second part of the harami pat-
tern at 2. By connecting the highs at 1 and 2 we get a rising
resistance line that intersected near $50 in mid May. Another
harami pattern intersected with the rising resistance line at this
point of intersection at $50 at area 3. (The fact that the May 13
session’s upper shadow exceeded the prior day’s range doesn’t
preclude this from being a harami since that pattern is only
concerned with the real bodies.) Thus, the candles give us
added proof (via the harami and long upper shadow of the sec-
ond line of the harami at 3) that the rising resistance line could
be an area where defensive actions are warranted.

EXHIBIT 11.10. Crude Oil—Daily (Rising Resistance Line)

Looking at Exhibit 11.10 we see an upward sloping resistance
line. The price activity from mid May reflects a market that is
creating a series of higher highs. However, a convergence of
technical factors on June 30, including a doji-like line (which
also formed a harami cross) at the ascending resistance line,
gave a signal for longs to take protective measures. Note the
large falling window opened the day after the doji-like line
between $31 and $30. The market fell until it found support in
early July. The rally from this support area stalled at the top of
the aforementioned window.

SPRINGS AND UPTHRUSTS

The concept of springs and upthrusts is based on work by
Richard Wyckoff, a very successful trader and newsletter pub-
lisher of the early twentieth century.

Exhibit 11.11 shows that a spring develops when the market
breaks under a horizontal support area and then springs back
above that previously broken support. In other words, new

(Spring)

EXHIBIT 11.11. Spring


--- 第 204 页 ---

EE _ EE

200 Part 2 © Convergence

Unsustained lows could not hold. Once a spring is formed, we can get a
_upinst. stop-out area and a price target. As shown in Exhibit 11.11,

when a market gets back above a recently broken support area,
one can consider buying. If the market is solid, it should not get

Pre ive back to the most recent lows. That would be a stop level
(preferably on a close). The target for the spring is either its
EXHIBIT 11.12. Upthrust high before the spring was made or the top end of its trading
range. This will be illustrated in some examples later in this sec-
tion.

Exhibit 11.12 shows an upthrust. This is when there is pene-
tration of a horizontal resistance area and then the bulls fail to
sustain these new highs. This is another way of saying a false
breakout. To use an upthrust for trading, when the market gets
back under its former resistance area, one can consider selling.
If the market is indeed weak, it should not return to the most
recent highs. A downside target is its most recent low or the
bottom of a recent trading range.

Although we will not focus on volume in this section, it will
be more bullish for a spring if the break of support is on light
volume and the subsequent rebound above the recently broken
support is on heavier volume. Similarly, the likelihood of an
upthrust successfully working should be increased if the break
over the resistance is on low volume and the consequent return
move under the old resistance is on high volume.

Why do springs and upthrusts work so well? To answer this,
refer to Napoleon’s response when asked which troops he con-
sidered best. His terse response was, “Those [that] are victori-
ous.” We can view the market as a battlefield between two sets
of troops—the bulls and the bears. The territory they each claim
is especially evident when there is a lateral trading range. The
horizontal resistance line is the bears’ terrain to defend. The
horizontal support line is the bulls’ domain to defend. If the
bears can’t defend the new lows on a break of support or the
bulls maintain the new highs on a penetration of resistance,
then they are not victorious.

In Exhibit 11.13 resistance is shown at A, B, and C, with the
doji at C confirming hesitation in the 1.7100-1.7150 area. At the
session after the doji at C, a surge of demand pushed the pound
over this resistance as it approached 1.74. However, the bulls’
victory was short-lived as the market soon pulled back under

what was broken resistance at A, B, and C. This was an
upthrust. As such, we have a downside target to the initial area
where the rally that took us to the upthrust began. Here is
where some subjectivity comes in. In my opinion the rally
began at area 1; others may view the leg up that began the rally
was the low of the bullish engulfing pattern at 2. In a scenario
like this, I suggest using a conservative target (at 1) and a more
liberal target (at 2). Interestingly, 1 became an area of temporary
stabilization before the more liberal target was obtained.

This steeply descending price action after this upthrust
reminds me of an apt Japanese saying, “Let him climb the roof
and then take away the ladder.”

At times there will be “scouting parties” (this is my term and
not a candle expression) sent by big traders, commercial
accounts, or even market makers or locals to test the resolve of
the opposing troops. For instance, there might be a move by the
bulls to try to propel prices over a resistance area. In such a bat-
tle, we have to monitor the determination of the bulls. If this
bullish scouting party can set up camp in enemy territory (that

is, close above resistance and maintain the new highs), then a
beachhead is made. New, fresh bullish troops should join the
scouting party. The market should move up. As long as the
beachhead is maintained (that is, the market holds above resis-
tance), the bulls will have control of the market. But once the
market pushes back under the broken resistance, the bulls have
lost control.

Let's look at this idea in the context of the upthrust in Exhibit
11.14. In late September there was a resistance zone shown by
the two horizontal lines. The extended white candle of October
16 pushed the stock over this resistance. The bulls’ “scouting
party” had, at least then, gotten a foothold as Juniper made a
new high close over an evident resistance area. By the next day
the whole texture of the market had changed as the black can-
dle’s close proved that the bulls didn’t have enough mettle to
hold the new highs. As such, an upthrust was created. The
highs of this upthrust remained resistance for the next week
before the market collapsed after the bearish engulfing pattern
that was completed October 23.

Our target for the upthrust was the prior low from where the
rally that took us to the upthrust began. Some may view this as
area 1; others, at area 2. As discussed in Exhibit 11.13 of the
British Pound, this is where subjectivity comes in. I would have
a conservative target at 1 and a liberal target at 2. This upthrust
also shows that it does not have to be an exact resistance area
for this technique to work.

In the prior exhibits the market had closed over resistance
and then retreated the next session to close back under the pre-
viously broken resistance area. Exhibit 11.15 illustrates where
an upthrust unfolds in a single session. In early April, at A,
small real bodies (including a shooting star) showed hesitation
near $30. Another attack on that area at B formed an evening
doji star on April 23, 26, and 27. On May 13 a shooting star pro-
pelled the stock intraday over this $30 resistance. By session’s
end the stock showed it was unable to maintain these new
highs as it closed back under resistance. In doing so, it had
formed an upthrust with a target to the immediately preceding
low near $26.25. This objective was reached on May 24 and 25.

In Exhibit 11.16 candle lines at 1, 2, and 3 are maintaining
support near 308.50. On March 1 the bears tried to get a
foothold as they made new lows to slightly under 306. By ses-
sion’s end the bears lost control as the index closed above the
previously broken support area of 308.50. Thus, the bears could
not get a beachhead—and a spring was formed. The day of the
spring was also a hammer. Now that we have the spring, we
also have a target. Specifically, this was the high before the
spring was made near 326. Note how at A and B the index got
within a few ticks of this target. This shows how technicals are
subjective. Those who waited to sell at the exact target area
would have been disappointed since it got very close to this tar-
get, but did not touch it.

Exhibit 11.16 showed a spring based on a single session (the
market made a new low and then closed above the broken sup-
port area by session end). Exhibit 11.17 is an example of a
spring formed over a few sessions. A new low close on
February 1 broke an evident support level at $20. The next day
the bulls came back, as the Japanese would express it, “in a
kamikaze attack,” and propelled the stock over this broken

hammer and spring

support area. In doing so, the stock made a spring. The target is
the most recent high near $23.75 from late January. This January
high was made via a doji following a tall white candle.
Interestingly, the stock hesitated there again with a similar
combination of tall white real body and doji lines on February
9 and 10.

One of the most powerful aspects of technical analysis is that
it helps foster a risk and money management approach to the
market. As such there should always be a price that says we are
wrong about our forecast. In this example, if after the February
2 spring, the market had pulled under the February 1 low, it
would void the target and would be a sign to reconsider long
positions.

THE CHANGE OF POLARITY PRINCIPLE

The Japanese have a saying: “A red lacquer dish needs no dec-
oration.” This concept of simple beauty is the essence of a tech-
nical principle I use frequently. It is as simple as it is powerful:

Old support becomes new resistance and old resistance becomes sup-
port. This is what I call the “change of polarity” principle. Exhibit
11.18 shows support converting to resistance. Exhibit 11.19 illustrates
prior resistance becoming new support.

The concept behind the change of polarity principle (although not
traditionally called that) is an axiom discussed in many books on tech-
nical analysis. Yet, it is an underutilized gem. To see how universally
well this rule works, let us briefly look at some examples across the
various time horizons and markets.

In Exhibit 11.20 a late December sell-off culminated near $5.35 (at
A). On another test at or near this level, there are at least three groups
who could consider buying.

* Group 1: Those who were waiting for the market to stabilize after
the prior sell-off and who now have a point at which the market
found support—$5.35 (the lows at area A). A few days later, a suc-
cessful test (at B) of this support probably pulled in new longs.

January, some of these old longs who were stopped out would
say to themselves that they were right about silver being in a
bull market. They just timed their original purchase incorrect-
ly. Now is the time to buy. They want to be vindicated in their
original view. They wait for a pullback to support at A or B to
buy. They again go long at C.

¢ Group 3: Those who bought at points A and B. They also see
the rally from B and may want to add to their position if they
get a “good price.” At area C, they have their good price
since the market is at support. Thus, more buyers come in at
C. Then, for good measure, another pullback to D draws in
more longs.

Then the problems start for the longs. In late February, prices
puncture support areas A, B, C, and D. A hammer on February
28 is a reason for some optimism, but anyone who bought at
this old support area is now in a losing trade.

What is the most important price in any market? The highs
made for move? The lows? Yesterday’s close? No. The most
important price on any chart is the price at which you entered the
market. People become strongly, keenly, and emotionally attached to
the price at which they bought or sold. These longs from $5.35
probably learn prayers in seven languages to get the market
back to breakeven.

Consequently, rallies to anywhere near where the longs
bought (around $5.35) will be gratefully used by them to exit
their longs. Thus, the original buyers at areas A, B, C, and D
may now become sellers. This is the main reason why old sup-
port becomes new resistance as shown by the resistance at E
and F.

A classic example of convergence of technical factors is high-
lighted in Exhibit 11.21. A support area from mid September to
early October near 1435 was breached in early October. A pierc-
ing pattern on October 12 and 13 (in which the white candle
was so strong that it was almost a bullish engulfing pattern)
signaled a rebound. The rally from this piercing pattern took
the S&P to the 1425 area, where we have a series of technical
signals converging including:

1. The bearish engulfing pattern of October 23 and 24.

2. A falling resistance line obtained by connecting the highs
from late September.

3. The resistance area defined by the change of polarity
obtained from a former support level near 1435.

In this instance of convergence, we had a candle signal (the
bearish engulfing pattern) confirming two Western indicators
(a resistance line and change of polarity).

The change of polarity does not necessarily have to be an
exact support area; it can be a zone. In Exhibit 11.22 there was
a region of support (shown by the two horizontal lines) from
$116 to $117.50. Once the lower end of this territory of support
was breached late on April 3, we then use the change of polar-
ity principle. This gives us resistance at prior support in the
aforementioned $116-$117.50 zone. The stock continued its
retreat late on April 3 until a pair of hammers hinted at stabi-
lization. The ascent from these hammers came to an end with
the convergence of the dark-cloud cover and change of polari-
ty on the morning of April 4.

We see resistance near $111.25 in Exhibit 11.23. Once the bulls
propelled Procter & Gamble over this area, we look for that to
become potential support. Although the series of small real
bodies from noon to late in the session on December 14 kept the
trend neutral. Since $111.25 held as support, the outlook
remained favorable. The last two long lower shadow candles
on December 14 visually confirmed the support near $111.25.

An evident resistance area in Exhibit 11.24 was reinforced by
the March 17 doji. Once the index pushed over this resistance,
we then convert this multitested resistance near 775 into sup-
port. This brings out an aspect about the change of polarity
principle: It usually requires that a support or resistance be test-
ed a few times before we can apply this technique.

A resistance line in Exhibit 11.25 was penetrated in early
February. On the price dip on the week of February 16, we see
a convergence of technical indicators as a hammer on February
20 confirmed a support level based on the change of polarity.
Another price descent ended with another hammer at this same

support area near $29.75. Although the hammer was confirm-
ing support, the hammer doesn’t provide a price target. This is
where the Western technicals come into play. We see a resis-
tance line formed from the highs in early to mid April. Using
this line as a potential resistance area, we then have a target if
we buy on the hammer near $31.50. This chart illustrated the
usefulness and advantage of using Western techniques in com-
bination with candles. The Western technicals can confirm a
candle signal (as the hammer confirmed the change of polari-
ty’s support) and we can also utilize the Western technicals to
obtain a potential target (the falling resistance line).

All things come to those who wait.

Mi usually do not trend straight up, nor do they fall
vertically down. They often retrace, or correct, some of
their advance, or decline, before resuming the prior trend.
Some of the more popular retracement levels are the 50% level
and the Fibonacci figures of 38% and 62% (see Exhibits 12.1 and
12.2). Fibonacci was a thirteenth-century mathematician who
derived a special sequence of numbers. These ratios include
61.8% (or its inverse of 1.618) and 38.2% (or its inverse of 2.618).
This is why the 62% (61.8% rounded off) and the 38% (38.2%

rection is also a Fibonacci ratio. The 50% retracement is proba-
bly the most widely monitored level. This is because the 50%
retracement is by users of Gann, Elliott Wave, or Dow theories.

Let us look at instances where retracements melded with
candle techniques to provide important turning signals.

A bullish engulfing pattern at B held as support with the
bullish long lower shadows on November 21. The rally from 1
to 2 pushed the stock $8 higher. As such, a 50% correction of
this rally is $4 off the highs. This means expected support near
$62.50 (50% of the $8 rally = $4; $4 added to $58.50 = $62.50). On
the approach to this level on November 22, the stock formed a
piercing pattern. As such we got a convergence via a candle
pattern at a 50% retracement level. While retracement levels
can become support or resistance, I would not suggest buying
or selling at a retracement area unless it was confirmed by a
candle pattern as it was here.

Exhibit 12.4 shows a rally from 1 to 2 that took the stock from
$25 to $33.50. A 50% correction of this rally would give poten-
tial support near $29. As the stock was descending from area 2
toward the potential support area, it did so with a series of long
lower shadows that hinted the bears were losing control. The
$29 level was potential support for another reason. Specifically,
if we look at the prior price peaks at A, B, and C, we can use the
change of polarity principle since this broken resistance zone

from $29 to $30 should become potential support. So, there was
a 50% correction in this scenario, along with a change of polar-
ity and converging long lower shadows, thus confirming one
another as the stock approached the $29 area.

We see a decline in Exhibit 12.5 from the price peak in
January at 1 to a bullish engulfing pattern in mid March at 2.
This low of the bullish engulfing pattern confirmed a hammer
from late February. The rally from the bullish engulfing pattern
stalled with a high-wave candle almost exactly at a 38.2%
Fibonacci retracement from the decline from 1 (at $22.65) to 2
(at $22.57). Another reason for resistance in this area was that it
was the November and December former support area. Since
the support area was broken, it then becomes new resistance
based on the change of polarity principle.

CHAPTER 13

CANDLES WITH
MOVING AVERAGES

+A+6

Ten men, ten tastes.

Te moving average is one of the oldest and most popular
tools used by technicians. Its strength is as a trend-follow-
ing device that offers the trader the ability to catch major
moves. Thus, it is utilized most effectively in trending markets.

THE SIMPLE MOVING AVERAGE

The most basic of the moving averages is, as the name implies,
the simple moving average. This is the average of all the price
points used. For example, let us say that the last five closing
prices of a stock were $38, $41, $36, $41, and $38. The 5-day
moving average of these closes would be:

217


--- 第 221 页 ---

218 Part 2 © Convergence
($38 + $41 + $36 + $41 + $38 = $194 = $38.80)
The general formula is:

(P1 + P2 + P3 + P4+ P5)
n

where P1 = the most recent price
P2 = the second most recent price and so on
n = the number of data points

The term “moving” in moving average is applicable because,
as the newest data is added to the moving average, the oldest
data is dropped. Consequently, the average is always moving
as the new data is added.

As seen in the simple moving average example above, each
day’s stock price contributed 1/5 to the total moving average
(since this was a 5-day moving average). A 9-day moving aver-
age means that each day will only be 1/9 of the total moving
average. Consequently, the longer the moving average, the less
effect an individual price will have on it.

The shorter the term of the moving average, the closer it will
“hug” prices. This is a plus insofar as it is more sensitive to
recent price action. The negative aspect is that it has a greater
potential for whipsaws. Longer-term moving averages provide
a greater smoothing effect, but are less responsive to recent
prices.

Some of the more popular moving averages include the 5-, 9-,
30-, and 50-day moving averages. Probably the most widely
monitored is the 200-day moving average.

The spectrum of moving average users runs from the intra-
day trader, who uses moving averages of real-time trades, to
the hedger, who may focus on monthly, or even yearly, moving
averages.

Other than the length of the average, another avenue of anal-
ysis is based on what price is used to compute the average.
Most moving average systems use, as we did in our prior
example, closing prices. However, moving averages of highs,
lows, and the midpoint of the highs and lows have all been
used. Sometimes, even moving averages of moving averages
are used.

Chapter 13 © Candles with Moving Averages 219
THE WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE

A weighted moving average assigns a different weight to each
price used to compute the average. Almost all weighted moving
averages are front loaded. That is, the most recent prices are
weighted more heavily than older prices. How the data is
weighted is a matter of preference.

THE EXPONENTIAL MOVING AVERAGE

The exponential moving average is a special type of weighted
moving average. Like the basic weighted moving average, the
exponential moving average is front weighted. Unlike other
moving averages, though, the exponential moving average
incorporates all prior prices used in the data. This type of mov-
ing average assigns progressively smaller weights to each of the
past prices. Each weight is exponentially smaller than the previ-
ous weight, hence, the name exponential moving average. One
of the most popular uses of the exponential moving average is
for use in the MACD. The MACD is discussed in Chapter 14.

USING MOVING AVERAGES

Moving averages can provide objective strategies with clearly
defined trading rules. Many of the computerized technical
trading systems are underpinned on moving averages. How
can moving averages be used? The answer to this is as varied
as there are different trading styles and philosophies. Some of
the more prevalent uses of the moving average include:

1, Comparing the price versus the moving averages as a trend
indicator. For instance, a good gauge to see if a market is in
an intermediate-term uptrend could be that prices have to be
above the 65-day moving average. For a longer-term
uptrend, prices would have to be higher than the 40-week
moving average.

2. Using the moving average as support or resistance levels. A
close above the specified moving average would be bullish.
A close below the moving average would be bearish.


--- 第 223 页 ---

=. OO ooo hCSsa Th Or

220 = Part 2 © Convergence

3. Monitoring the moving average band (also known as
envelopes). These bands are a certain percentage above or
below the moving average and can serve as support or resis-
tance.

4, Watching the slope of the moving average. For instance, if
the moving average levels off or declines after a period of a
sustained rise, it may be a bearish signal. Drawing trend
lines on the moving averages is a simple method of monitor-
ing their slope.

5. Trading with dual moving averages. One can compare a
shorter- and longer-term moving average to each other. If the
short-term moving average crosses under the longer-term
moving average, it would turn the trend down. In Japan,
such a crossover is called a “dead cross.” When a shorter-
term moving average crosses over a long-term moving aver-
age, the Japanese refer to that as a “golden cross” because it
is viewed as a potentially bullish signal. Some traders will
even take the dual moving averages a step further by saying
that for a trend to be higher, not only does the short-term
moving average have to be over the long-term moving aver-
age, but the slope of both moving averages must be up.
Trading with dual moving averages is discussed. in Chapter
14.

The following examples use various moving averages.
Generally I have found the 30-day and shorter-term 5-day mov-
ing averages are good gauges for the equity markets. For
futures, the 40- and 65-day moving averages are useful. They
are not based on optimum moving averages. An optimum
moving average today might not be the optimum one tomor-
row. The length of the moving averages used in the following
examples are not the important point. What is meaningful is
how moving averages can be melded with candles.

In Exhibit 13.1 we see a moving average that became an
excellent area of support. There may have been times before
August (when this chart begins) in which this moving average
was not so effective as it was during this time. However, once
we determined that the moving average was valid, as it was in
late August and late September, we can then turn our attention
to this particular moving average with the idea that retrace-

ments should hold the moving average as support. With a
downdraft that started with the bearish engulfing pattern the
week of October 11, we would view this moving average as
potential support. As the stock got to this moving average on
October 15, it made a hammer with the white candle after the
hammer completed a bullish engulfing pattern. This conver-
gence of factors (moving average as support, the hammer, the
bullish engulfing pattern) defined the low of the correction
near $48.75. As useful as moving averages are, I would not sug-
gest using a moving average—no matter how often it has suc-
cessfully been defended—as a sole reason to trade. It is much
more important to have a candlestick signal confirming a mov-
ing average’s support or resistance before initiating, or offset-
ting, a position.

In Exhibit 13.2 we have a short-term moving average. We can
tell it is a short-term moving average because of how closely it
hugs prices. This happens to be a 9-period exponential moving
average, which is popular among foreign exchange traders. We
could see how well this moving average acted as an upside

resistance area during the decline from mid January on. In early
February through mid February, there were numerous candle-
stick bottoming signals including two piercing patterns and a
bullish engulfing pattern. Nonetheless, resistance at the mov-
ing average remained in force. Consequently, to confirm the
potential bullish implication of these candle signals, one should
wait for a breakout over the resistance area defined by the mov-
ing average. Since this breakout didn’t occur, it would keep one
from buying.

Exhibit 13.3 displays a short-term moving average that was
resistance during the descent beginning in mid August. On
August 30 and 31 the stock pushed over this resistance intra-
day, but failed to close above it—thus keeping the trend down.
On September 7 and 8 there was a little whipsaw as the stock
closed above this moving average and then failed. Generally,
however, this moving average (which is a 5-day moving aver-
age) should be respected as resistance because of how well it
worked. Starting September 20 the stock built a series of bullish
long lower shadows with the last long lower shadow candle on

September 24 as a hammer. While these candle lines gave a
visual clue that the market was groping for a bottom, it took the
September 25 close to get final bullish confirmation as this can-
dle completed a bullish engulfing pattern and closed above this
moving average. Note how this moving average held as sup-
port on the late September rally and as resistance during the
early October decline.

Exhibit 13.4 displays how a moving average can become sup-
port and resistance. On the initial ascent on the week of May 8,
natural gas ascended and maintained this moving average’s
support (shown at the arrows). On July 5 the moving average’s
support was penetrated with a falling window. Consequently,
we now have two reasons for resistance. The first is the moving
average. Since this average worked so well as support, it
should be expected to act equally well as resistance. Second, a
falling window between $4.29 and $4.41 should also be resis-
tance. In early July, natural gas got to this moving average’s
resistance but failed to close over it. The early July rally was
also a failure of the window’s resistance zone.

CANDLES WITH
OSCILLATO

FIDL & bi

Let every bird sing its own note.

nlike pattern recognition techniques that are subjective
(this includes candlestick techniques), oscillators are
mathematically derived techniques that offer a more objective
means of analyzing the market. They are widely used and are
the basis of many computerized trading systems.
Oscillators include such technical tools as the relative
strength index, stochastics, and MACD. The three major uses of
oscillators are:

1. As a divergence indicator. There are two kinds of divergence. A
negative, or bearish, divergence occurs when prices are at a
new high, but the oscillator is not. This implies the market is
internally weak. A positive, or bullish, divergence is when

prices are at a new low, but the oscillator does not hit a new
low. The implication is that the selling pressure is losing
steam.

2. As overbought/oversold indicators. This means oscillators can
notify the trader if the market has become overextended and,
thus, vulnerable to a correction.

3. As confirmation of the force behind a trend’s move. Oscillators can
confirm the market’s momentum, measuring the velocity of
a price move by comparing price changes. In theory, the
velocity should increase as the trend is under way. A flatten-
ing of momentum could be an early warning that a price
move may be decelerating.

There is a Japanese saying: “All clouds do not rain.” I view
the oscillator as a rain cloud that has the potential for rain—but
the only way to tell it’s raining is either seeing or feeling the
raindrops. So it is with oscillators. An oscillator is like a storm
cloud, but we need a final confirmation with candle signals.
Thus, I view an overbought or oversold oscillator as only a
warning, a clue, with final confirmation coming with a candle-
stick pattern.

THE RELATIVE STRENGTH INDEX

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is one of the most popular
oscillators. The RSI oscillator is different from the concept of the
relative strength. The relative strength compares the relative
strength performance of a stock, or a small group of stocks, with
the performance of a sector or a broader market index such as
the Dow Jones or the S&P 500.

Computing the RSI

The RSI compares the relative strength of price advances to
price declines over a specified period. Nine and 14 days are
two of the most popular periods used. The RSI is figured by
comparing the gains of up sessions with the losses of the down
sessions over a given time frame. The calculations used are
dependent only on closing prices. The formula is:

RSI = 100 - (100/(1 + RS))
where RS= average up points for period

average down points for period


--- 第 230 页 ---

Chapter 14 © Candles with Oscillators

Thus, computing a 14-day RSI entails adding the total gains
made on the up days over the last 14 days (on a close-to-close
basis) and dividing by 14. The same would be done for the
down days. These figures provide the relative strength (RS).
This RS is then put into the RSI formula. This RSI formula con-
verts the RS data so that it becomes an index with a range
between 0 and 100.

Using the RSI

The two main uses of RSI are as an overbought/oversold indi-
cator and as a tool to monitor divergence.

¢ As an overbought/oversold indicator, the RSI implies that
the market is overbought if it approaches the upper end of
this band (that is, above 70%). At that point, the market may
be vulnerable to a pullback or could move into a period of
consolidation. Conversely, at the lower end of the RSI range
(usually below 30%), it is said to reflect an oversold condi-
tion. In such an environment, there is a potential of a short
covering move.

¢ As a divergence tool, RSI calculations can be helpful when
prices make a new high for the move and the RSI fails to
make a concurrent high. This is called negative divergence
and is potentially bearish. Positive divergence occurs when
prices make a new low, but the RSI does not. Divergence is
more meaningful when RSI oscillator readings are in over-
bought or oversold regions.

In Exhibit 14.1, through the later part of November there was
resistance near $58. Once Albertson’s pushed over that level
with a tall white candle on December 1, we can then use the
change of polarity that converts the prior resistance into new
support. There was vacillation the week of December 14, but a
series of bullish long lower shadows showed that this stock had
a good foundation near $62. The rally resumed on December
21, stalling with a dark-cloud cover. As the stock formed this
dark-cloud cover at new highs, the RSI was overbought and
also formed a negative divergence signal. That is, the stock’s
price was higher at 2 than 1, but the RSI was lower at 2 than 1.
The aforementioned dark-cloud cover became resistance as
confirmed by another dark-cloud cover made on January 10
and 11. A piercing pattern in mid January at P occurred in an
oversold environment (as gauged by the RSI).

EXHIBIT 14.1. Albertson’s—Daily (RSI)

This convergence of bearish divergence and the dark-cloud
cover reinforced the potential bearish implications of the dark-
cloud cover. Trend lines can also be used on the relative
strength index. This is shown by the dashed line on the oscilla-
tor. Note that, once this rising support line was penetrated, it
became another negative signal.

A key concept with candle charts is that the overall technical
picture is more important than a single candle line. One should
always view the candle line or candle pattern in the context of
its market surroundings.

In Exhibit 14.2 there are two bullish engulfing patterns
shown as 1 and 2. (Although the open of the white candle of
this pattern was the same as the close of the black candle, this
is acceptable as a bullish engulfing pattern since foreign
exchange markets’ open and close are the same.) Bullish
engulfing pattern 2 was more important than bullish engulfing
pattern 1 because the second bullish engulfing pattern was con-
firmed by bullish divergence. In the first bullish engulfing pat-
tern, the RSI was continuing its descent as the stock made new
lows. This kept the bearish momentum intact.

MOVING AVERAGE OSCILLATOR

Computing the Moving Average Oscillator

This indicator is obtained by subtracting the shorter-term mov-
ing average from the longer-term moving average. It has plus
or minus values. Thus, a value above 0 means the shorter-term
moving average is above the longer-term moving average. A
reading under 0 means the shorter-term moving average is less
than the longer-term moving average.

Using the Moving Average Oscillator

Since this oscillator uses a short- and long-term moving aver-
age, we are comparing the short-term momentum to a longer-
term momentum. This is because the short-term moving aver-
age is more responsive to recent price activity. If the short-term
moving average is relatively far above (or below) the longer-
term moving average, the market is said to be overbought (or
oversold). As with the other oscillators, the moving average
oscillator is also used as a divergence vehicle.

As prices increase, the technician wants to see the short-term
moving average increase relative to the longer-term moving
average. This would mean increasing positive values for the
moving average difference line. If prices advance and the dif-
ference between the short- and long-term moving averages nar-
rows, the market is indicating that the shorter-term momentum
is running out of steam.

During the first week of May in Exhibit 14.3 the Eurodollar
built a bullish engulfing pattern at B. After a small rally from
this pattern, the market retreated and found support, as expect-
ed, at the lows of the bullish engulfing pattern. Not only was
the support area defended with a May 19 hammer, but there
was also the bullish divergence as the Eurodollar marginally
made a new low while the moving average oscillator made a
higher low with the hammer. Once the market pushed above
.9200 from the hammer, it confirmed a double bottom made
with the dual lows at the bullish engulfing pattern and ham-
mer. As will be discussed in Chapter 16, we can use a breakout
from the .350 trading range (i.e., from .8850 to .9200) to give us
a target toward .9550 (obtained by adding the .350 trading
range onto the breakout point of .9200).

In Exhibit 14.4 Catalina was ascending along a rising resis-
tance line. During the week of July 13, although the stock was
hovering near its current highs, a series of small real bodies
showed that the bulls’ advance was being constrained by the
bears. This hesitation near $56 is not surprising considering
that level was resistance in late April.

We now turn our attention to the moving average oscillator.
At the time of the aforementioned small real bodies in mid July,
there was also bearish convergence. Consequently, we have a
classic example of convergence at $56. Specifically: (1) The
stock was at a resistance area based on the rising resistance line
and the prior April price peak; (2) a series of small real bodies
showing a market separating from its bull trend; and (3) the
bearish divergence. If we need more proof of a market in trou-
ble, then we would have received this signal with a falling win-
dow (at the arrow) that became resistance.

Exhibit 14.5 displays a key use of candles and oscillators.
Most equity traders are buyers; relatively few are short sellers.
Achallenge longs may have is knowing when to exit a position.
This is where an oscillator, especially when confirmed with a
candles line or pattern, can become useful. As we saw in

EXHIBIT 14.5. Wal-Mart Stores—Daily (Moving Average Oscillator)

Exhibit 14.4, when a stock becomes overextended and there is
also a candlestick confirming a turn, it could be a good place to
either exit longs or lighten up on long positions. With this in
mind, let’s look at each overbought occurrence:

1. There were two hanging man lines at H in the first week of
March. These appeared during an overbought market (based
on the oscillator), but they were not confirmed by a close
under their real bodies. Remember, for bearish confirmation
of a hanging man, we need a close under the hanging man’s
real body to confirm a hanging man’s potentially bearish
implications. Additionally, the market formed a rising win-
dow on the first hanging man session. As such, the window
became support. So, while the market was overextended,
there was no bearish confirmation of a market rate turn at 1
based on the candle lines. The bearish engulfing pattern at B
on March 18 and 19 was a turning signal not only because of
the bearish engulfing pattern itself, but also because at the
time of that pattern the stock had made a new high and the
moving average oscillator had made a lower high. This
formed bearish or negative divergence.


--- 第 236 页 ---

Chapter 14 ¢ Candles with Oscillators

2. An overbought reading with the oscillator, but no turning
signals with the candles since the candle line during the
overbought reading was a tall white real body. A few days
after this white real body we can see a bearish engulfing pat-
tern (at C) which became resistance for a few sessions.

3. On April 7 Wal-Mart moved above the bearish engulfing pat-
tern discussed above. As such, it could be viewed as a bullish
breakout. At area 3 the oscillator was overbought, but there
were no turning signals with the candles and we would not
look to sell. A cautionary signal would come a few days later
with a long-legged doji after a tall white candle.

4, An overbought oscillator with a doji confirming a potential
turn. While the stock hesitated at this doji, a small rising win-
dow opened between April 22 and 23 as support. Thus, we
would need further bearish confirmation by a close under
the window. The break of the window’s support occurred on
April 28.

5. Ahanging man at the arrow on May 11 and an overextended
oscillator gave us a turning signal. The bearish implications
of the hanging man were confirmed by a lower close the next
day.

6. A doji confirming hesitation. Similar to 4, there was a rising
window that needed to be closed before the trend could be
viewed as damaged. The close under the window’s support
took place on June 8.

STOCHASTICS

The stochastic oscillator is another popular tool. It, like all the
other oscillators, provides overbought and oversold readings
and signals divergences. It also affords a mechanism to relate a
shorter-term trend to a longer-term trend. The stochastic indi-
cator compares the latest closing price with the total range of
price action for a specified period. Stochastic values are
between 0 and 100. A high stochastic reading would mean the
close is near the upper end of the entire range for the period. A
low reading means that the close is near the low end of the
period’s range. The idea behind stochastics is that as the mar-
ket moves higher, closes tend to be near the highs of the range;
as the market moves lower, prices tend to cluster near the lows
of the range.

233

Part 2 © Convergence

Computing Stochastics

The stochastic indicator is comprised of two lines: the %K and
the %D. The %K line, called the raw stochastic or the fast %K,
is more sensitive. The formula for the %K line is:

(Close) — (Low of N)
(High of N) - (Low of N)

X 100 = %K

where Close = current close
Low of N = low of the range during the period used
High of N = high of the range during the period used

The “100” in the equation converts the value into a percent-
age. Thus, if the close today is the same as the high for the
period under observation, the fast %K would be 100%. A period
can be in days, weeks, or even intraday (such as hourly).
Fourteen, nineteen, and twenty-one periods are some of the
more common periods.

Because the fast %K line can be so volatile, this line is usually
smoothed by taking a 3-period moving average of the last three
%K values. This 3-period moving average of %K is called the
slow %K. Most technicians use the slow %K line instead of the
choppy fast %K line. This slow %K is then smoothed again using
a 3-day moving average of the slow %K to get what is called the
%D line. This %D is essentially a moving average of a moving
average. One way to think of the difference between the %K and
%D lines is too view them as you would two moving averages
with the %K line comparable to a short-term moving average,
and the %D line comparable to a longer-term moving average.

Using Stochastics

As mentioned previously, stochastics can be used in several
ways. The most popular method is as a tool for showing diver-
gence. Most technicians who monitor stochastics use this
aspect of divergence in conjunction with overbought/oversold
readings.

Some technicians require another rule: to have the slow %K
line cross under the %D line for a sell signal, or for the slow
%K to move above the %D for a buy signal. This is compara-
ble to the bullish (bearish) signal of a faster moving average
crossing over (under) the slower moving average.

Another use is as a gauge for overbought/oversold. Most
traders will view an 80% or higher reading as overbought, and


--- 第 238 页 ---

Chapter 14 © Candles with Oscillators

20% or lower as oversold. For instance, to get a buy signal, the
market must be oversold (20% or less for %D), there is positive
divergence, and the %K line is crossing above the %D line.

Exhibit 14.6 displays a small bearish engulfing pattern at B in
the early morning of October 23. Normally such a small bearish
engulfing pattern is not significant, but, when combined with
stochastics, we see that the stochastic is overextended and there
is a bearish crossover (where the faster %K line crosses under
the slower %D line). This put more significance on the bearish
engulfing pattern. We look for the high of this pattern at $105 to
be resistance. This resistance held as a stock got to $104 the fol-
lowing morning from where it then failed.

A large falling window opened October 25. A nicely defined
hammer appeared early the next morning (October 26). A few
periods before this hammer, we got a tentative clue of bottom
with the stochastics. Specifically, early on October 26 the
stochastic was in oversold territory (that is, below 20%). We
also see a bullish crossover where the faster %K line crossed
above the slower %D line. Soon after the stochastic turning sig-
nal, we got a bullish candle signal with the aforementioned

hammer. This hammer held as support. If the stock had pulled
under the hammer’s low then, in spite of the positive stochas-
tic reading, one should consider vacating longs.

Exhibit 14.7 shows a series of long lower shadows emerged in
early October. During the week of October 12 we see the
stochastic oscillator in oversold readings near 20% with a
bullish crossover. This reinforced what the bullish shadows had
hinted at, that the stock was stabilizing.

A doji-like line emerged on October 19 following a tall white
candle. This converted the trend from up to more neutral since
the doji hinted that the market was “tired.” The market tread-
ed water after this doji and then pushed higher with the
November 2 rising window. This window became support dur-
ing the week of November 2. A bearish engulfing pattern on
November 6 and 9 at B turned the trend less positive. This bear-
ish engulfing pattern had about equally sized real bodies; nor-
mally we like to see a black real body of the bearish engulfing
pattern much larger than the white real body. This shows the
bears have wrested control from the bulls. In this case, howev-
er, at the time of the bearish engulfing pattern, there was also a
bearish crossover in the stochastic reading. As such, when

combined with the stochastic reading, this bearish engulfing
pattern took on extra significance.

MOVING AVERAGE CONVERGENCE-
DIVERGENCE

Constructing the MACD

While the Moving Average Convergence—Divergence (MACD)
is composed of two lines, it is really a combination of three
exponentially smoothed moving averages. The first line is the
difference between two exponential moving averages (usually
the 26- and 12-period exponential moving averages). The sec-
ond line of the MACD is made by taking an exponential mov-
ing average (usually 9-period) of the difference between the
two exponential moving averages used to make the first line.
This second line is called the signal line.

Using the MACD

When the faster line crosses above the slower (the signal line),
it is viewed as a positive. A bearish crossover is when the faster
line moves under the slower line. The MACD can also be used
to find areas in which the market is overbought or oversold.
Because of the slower nature of MACD, it is not generally used
as a short-term trading tool.

In Exhibit 14.8 the tall white candle on March 16 opened a ris-
ing window. The next day the small real body inside this white
candle formed a harami pattern. The correction from this
harami pattern found stabilization at the aforementioned win-
dow. A dark-cloud cover on March 30 and April 1 at D gave
early evidence that the market, as the Japanese would say, “had
a poor chance of rising.” This dark-cloud cover became resis-
tance shown by the action the following two days. While the
stock pushed over the dark-cloud’s resistance intraday, it had
failed to close above it, thus keeping the resistance intact.

The week after the emergence of the dark-cloud cover, we get
the bearish confirmation via the MACD as the faster line cross-
es under the slower signal line.

Note how the decline from the dark-cloud cover continued
until the market formed a bullish engulfing pattern in mid
April. This bullish engulfing pattern confirmed the potential
support area at the rising window from March 15 and 16.

This chart is a good example of the value added of candle
charts. Very often candles will give a turning signal ahead of
traditional Western technicals. In this scenario we saw the dark-
cloud cover presaging a top almost a week before the MACD
gave its reversal signal.

In Exhibit 14.9 the S&P made a new high in mid July. But
indications of trouble came with the bearish engulfing pattern
at B. Further dampening the bullish outlook was a bearish clue
sent via the MACD as the faster line crossed under the slower
line. The session after the bearish engulfing pattern, the market
opened a falling window. Because the market had a rising win-
dow the prior week, this falling window built an island top.
This further reinforced the potentially bearish outlook.

In Exhibit 14.10 a large bullish engulfing pattern was com-
pleted on August 3. A few sessions after this, there was a bullish
crossover in the MACD (another example of candles giving an
earlier clue of a reversal than Western techniques). The ascent
from this bullish engulfing pattern continued until the evening
star. (The middle part of the pattern was also a high-wave can-
dle.) A day after this evening star pattern, the nail in the coffin
was placed with the bearish crossover in the MACD.

A single arrow is easily broken, but not ten in a bundle.

oO” of the most important clues sent out by the market is
volume. Volume is like water pressure in a hose. The
greater the water pressure, the more powerful the water flow.
Likewise, the stronger the volume, the more the force behind
the move.

Volume should increase in the direction of the trend to
improve the likelihood that the current trend should continue.
If, however, volume declines as a trend progresses, there is less
reason to believe the trend will continue. Volume can also be
useful for confirming tops and bottoms.

whichever forms of volume analysis you now use will help
enhance the effectiveness of candle charts.

I’m frequently asked at my seminars about combining vol-
ume with candle charts by changing the width of the candles
according to their volume. That is, the higher the volume, the
wider the real body. In my opinion, it is just as easy to read vol-
ume classically—on the bottom of a chart. The disadvantage to
adjusting the thickness of the candle line with volume is that if
there are many high-volume sessions, there will be fewer can-
dle charts that can fit on the screen. Volume is so important that
however you choose to display it is not important. What is
important is that if it is available, you should use it.

Because volume numbers are different from market to mar-
ket, I don’t look at an absolute volume figure, but at relative
volume. In other words, in one stock 50,000 shares could be an
extraordinarily high-volume session—while, in another, 10 mil-
lion shares might be light volume. As such, I look for relative
volume spikes in a market.


--- 第 245 页 ---

Chapter 15 © Candles with Volume

In Exhibit 15.1 we can see how this stock had a volume spurt
late on May 3. We see that compared with preceding sessions,
this was an abnormal volume. As such, we should pay atten-
tion to it. This high-volume session was also a hammer. This is
what we like to see—volume confirming price.

This chart brings out another aspect. A very long lower shad-
ow hammer means that by the time the hammer is confirmed
(we need to wait for a close to confirm the hammer), the mar-
ket could be well off its lows. Buying at the close of such a ham-
mer may not present an attractive risk/reward since the market
may retrace back to the lows of the hammer before, potentially,
resuming an upward course. A high-volume hammer, such as
in this chart, decreases the chance for a correction to the ham-
mer’s low. Therefore, one may be more aggressive about buy-
ing on the hammer’s close if it is a usually high-volume ham-
mer than one would if the volume didn’t give the same force-
ful confirmation.

momentum. A single session, on November 11, changed the
technical picture. That session’s spinning top completed the
second session of the harami pattern. However, of greater con-
sequence was that spinning top’s strong volume. This showed
that as heavy as the supply was (and we know there was heavy
supply because of the high volume), the demand was strong
enough to keep the bears in check—hence, the small real body.

The market rallied from this harami. On the next sell-off later
in November, the stock stabilized with a piercing pattern. With
the piercing pattern, we would like to see lighter volume on the
black candle and heavier volume on the white candle. This
would serve to reinforce that the bears are losing force and the
bulls are gaining a stronger foothold. This scenario of lighter
volume black and heavier volume white is what unfolded in
Capital One. This volume scenario also increases the odds that
the piercing pattern will hold. In this example, the piercing pat-
tern’s support was well defended with the December 15 ham-
mer.

This concept of volume confirming the candle pattern can be
used for any candle signals. For instance, this would mean that
a bearish engulfing pattern should have a lighter volume on the
first candle (the white) and a heavier volume on the second
candle (the black) to increase the bearish engulfing pattern’s
significance.

Adding the insights of volume to the power of a falling or ris-
ing window is, as the Japanese proverb says, “Like the right
hand helping the left.” In Exhibit 15.3, the market formed a
bullish harami cross the week of May 8. A few sessions later a
tiny rising window opened between May 13 and 15. This
diminutive window was support throughout the week of May
15. On May 22 an expanded rising window opened. This win-
dow also had the bullish kicker of extra heavy volume. While a
rising window is viewed as potential support, a high-volume
window enhances its effectiveness as support (or, in the case of
a falling window, as resistance). A bullish long lower shadow on
June 1 was confirmation of the bulls’ force as the stock held the
$30 support area on a close (as defined by the bottom of the May
22 window).

While a small real body is a clue that a decline or advance
may be exhausting itself, if we add high volume to a small real

body, we get more substantiation of a turn. Let’s look at Exhibit
15.4 to describe why this is so. In this chart of Dell I circled a
high-volume day (at 1) on August 18, which was also a rising
window. As examined in Exhibit 15.3, a high-volume rising
window should be a solid support area. This was the case with
Dell as shown by the action a few days after the rising window.

Another unusually large volume session occurred October 19
(at 2). The day was also a doji. This high-volume doji was sig-
nificant insofar as it came after a steep decline that took Dell to
a support area at the early August bullish engulfing pattern
(that had a hammer as the first candle line). As discussed in
Chapter 8, I usually pay less attention to doji in declines than
advances. However, since this doji corroborated a support area
and had large volume, I certainly would stand up and take
notice of it. What this high-volume doji evidenced was that
there was heavy supply (as proven by the high volume); but
with the stock forming a doji, it proved that the demand was
strong enough to absorb the supply. On October 19 we thus

have a convergence of technical factors underscoring the
importance of $37.25 as support:

1. A support area based on the lows of the August bullish
engulfing pattern.

2. The doji.

3. The expansive volume on the doji displaying all the heavy
supply was being absorbed.

Note how this support was again successfully defended the
week after the doji with a tall white candle.

The same theory about a high-volume doji during a decline
increasing the chance of a turn compared with a regular vol-
ume session is true even if the candle is a small real body. (We
saw a high-volume spinning top in Exhibit 15.2.) To summarize
integrating high volume with spinning tops or doji:

met with enough supply to stall the rally. This is a possible
top reversal.

2. A very heavy-volume doji or small real body during a steep
decline shows that heavy supply is being taken by the equal-
ly aggressive demand.

Whether there is a single candle line or a group of candles
forming a pattern, the chances of a turnaround are increased if
volume confirms what the candle pattern is showing. Exhibit
15.5 shows a bullish engulfing pattern late on October 5. The
first part of the bullish engulfing pattern was a spinning top
that hinted the previous downdraft was losing some steam.
The next session’s long white candle showed the bulls had
gtabbed control. Adding to the bullish impetus of this bullish
engulfing pattern was that the first part of this pattern was
lighter volume as compared with the long white candle’s vol-
ume. This convergence of volume and bullish engulfing pattern
reinforced one another and increased the likelihood of a turn.
The ascent from the bullish engulfing pattern stalled early on
October 7 with a bearish engulfing pattern and a series of can-

dies with bearish upper shadows at $72.50. This confirmed
resistance from the prior session’s long upper shadow at the
same level.

As a general rule we can say that the longer the white candle,
the more probable a continuation of a rally. But volume adds
another important dimension to this. As illustrated in Exhibit
15.6, an extended white candle line on May 12 pushed the stock
to a new high. However, mitigating some of this bullishness is
this candle’s light volume. When a market creates a new high,
we would like to see that confirmed by a push in volume. In
this case, volume didn’t corroborate the breakout. Although
lack of volume on an upside breakout wouldn’t convert me
from a bull to a bear, it is a reason to be more circumspect. This
is because such a low-volume rally increases the chances that it
will not be sustained. In this stock, the candle after the May 12
low-volume tall white candle was a long black one and, as
such, reinforced the lack of the bulls’ control.

andle charts, because they provide an x-ray into the

demand /supply situation, are potent in calling early turn-
ing signals. Assuming one enters a trade with a candle signal
(preferably with confirmation with other candle or Western sig-
nals), the challenge becomes knowing when to exit.

My firm, candlecharts.com, utilizes different exit strategies,
depending on the client’s trading style. One method we use is
forecasting price objectives from classic Western patterns. There
is another reason for incorporating measured targets. No matter
how ideal a candle pattern or how many reversal signals con-
verge at one area, it doesn’t predict the extent of the reversal.
This is where we shift to Western technicals for price objectives.

The measuring techniques in this chapter will illustrate a few
of these many patterns, including breakouts from a box range,
swing targets, flags and pennants, and ascending and descend-
ing triangles.

Price targets are not synonymous with support or resistance.
For example, if there is an upside objective of $42, this does not
mean the rally will stop at $42 (of course, it may not even get
to $42). In my opinion, one should not look at a price objective
to initiate a new position, but to offset an outstanding position.
In the example discussed above, I would use a rally to the $42
area to liquidate longs, but not to initiate a new short position.
Of course, if there were a bearish candle signal or a conver-
gence of other technical signals, hinting that $42 was an area of
resistance, one could then be more aggressive about consider-
ing a sale.

BREAKOUTS FROM BOXES

Most of the time, the markets are not in a trending mode but
rather in a lateral range, what the Japanese call a box range. On
such occasions, the market is in a relative state of harmony with
neither the bulls nor the bears in charge. The Japanese word for
tranquility and calm is “wa.” I like to think of markets that are
bounded in a box range as being in a state of “wa.”

When a market is in a box, it is like a coiled spring ready to
unwind when the surrounding pressure is released. We can use
this potential pent-up energy. When a breakout from box range
unfolds, the market has good potential continuing in the direc-
tion of the breakout.

As shown in Exhibit 16.1, a move outside the box implies a
move at least equal to the vertical height of the box. Specifically,
on a push above the top end of the box (bullish breakout), one
takes the vertical measurement from the bottom end of the box
(the support area) to the top end of the box range (the previous
resistance). This distance is shown as A-B. We derive a target
by adding this A-B range onto the prior resistance area. As an
example, an upside breakout from a $50-$53 box range would
give a $56 target.

The opposite would be a penetration of a box range’s sup-
port (shown as a bearish breakout in Exhibit 16.1). If we used

EXHIBIT 16.1. Breakout from Boxes

the same $50-$53 box range, a bearish break of this support at
$50 would provide a $47 target.

In Exhibit 16.2 there’s a box range environment with the top
end at areas 1 and 2. The bottom end of the box (the support
zone) is delineated by the two horizontal lines between 3600
and 3500 (we will discuss area A in a moment).

The top at 1 did not have any candlestick reversals. This illus-
trates that not all reversals are signaled with candles. The top at
2 was an ideal version of an evening star since none of the three
real bodies that comprise this pattern touched. Additionally,
the high point of 2 was a hanging man line that was confirmed
the next session.

Once the NASDAQ failed from area 2, we can say that as a
failure from the prior high at 1, it could retreat to the low made
between the highs at 1 and 2. This low was the bullish engulf-
ing pattern at A. As such, we have a price target toward 3600-
3500. This area held in the latter part of September via a couple
of tall white candles near 3600.

The early October rupturing of this support did double dam-
age. First, the long black real body of October 2 punctured the
bottom end of the bullish engulfing pattern at A and thus broke
a support area. Perhaps of more consequence was that once the
bottom end of the large box range of 4250 to 3500 was broken,
it gave us a target toward 2750. This measurement was
obtained by taking the 750 points (from the high to low of the
box range) from the bottom end of the box near 3500. This tar-
get was met a few months later.

EXHIBIT 16.2. NASDAQ Composite Index—Daily (Downside Breakout from a

Box)

We can see by the move under this target of 2750 that price tar-
gets do not necessarily mean a support area. This is a very impor-
tant point to consider. Just because the NASDAQ got to 2750 does
not mean that one should buy because it got to a target.

This chart also highlights a reason I like box breakouts. Once
a support area is penetrated, we can then use the change of
polarity principle (see Chapter 11) to define what should
become resistance. Based on this technique, the prior support
(in this example, 3600-3500) should be converted into resis-
tance. That is what unfolded here. If the index had closed back
above 3600, it would have voided my downside target of 2750.

Exhibit 16.3 shows a clearly defined lateral range from $66.25
to $67.75. The candle line at A breaches this support line, but
since it did not close below it, the support was still intact. At B
the market closed under its box range. This was the bearish sig-
nal. We got earlier clues of a stock in trouble before the break at
B with the downward sloping resistance line shown on the
chart. This increased the likelihood that the support level at
$66.25 would eventually break.

EXHIBIT 16.3. JDS Uniphase—5 Minutes (Downside Breakout from a Box)

Once support gave way with candle line B, we know (from
the change of polarity) that this old support, $66.25, converts
into resistance. So, now we have a resistance area, but what is
our downside potential? For this we use the vertical distance of
the $66.25-$67.75 box range and subtract that $1.50 from the
bottom end of the trading range, giving us a target toward
$64.75.

The S&P, as shown in Exhibit 16.4, was in a trading range
between the 1090 area (at B) and 1140 (at A). The bulls pro-
pelled this index above the 1140 resistance on June 24. Adding
this A—B (50-point) span onto 1140 gave us a price projection of
1190. This target was exceeded marginally as the stock ascend-
ed along a rising resistance line (see Chapter 11). There are a
couple of high-wave candles near 1200. (A high-wave candle
has extended upper and lower shadows and a small real body.
It is related to a long-legged doji, except that a long-legged doji
has a doji instead of the small real body, as described in Chapter
8.) These high-wave candles gave a sense that the market was
losing its sense of direction (which heretofore was up).

EXHIBIT 16.5. Texas Instruments—Daily (Upside Breakout from a Box)



--- 第 257 页 ---

Exhibit 16.5 shows that Texas Instruments was locked in a
$130-$145 box. When it approached the top end of this range
on February 17 and 18, it formed a bearish engulfing pattern.
This pattern should be resistance. However, the next session
(February 22) got above this resistance. This was a bullish
breakout pushed over the bearish engulfing pattern’s resistance
and also penetrated the top end of a box. This implied a price
target toward $160 (based on the previous $15 range).

What would tell us we were wrong about this target? If, once
the market got above $145, as it did on September 22, it got
back down under $145 on a close, such a scenario would negate
this target. In other words, once the market makes a new high,
it is important for the bulls to show they have control by sus-
taining the new highs.

SWING TARGETS, FLAGS, AND PENNANTS

Swing targets, flags, and pennants are comprised of three seg-
ments:

1. An initial cleanly defined brisk move.
2. Acorrection of the move.

3. A resumption of the move in the same direction as the initial
move.

We will look at swing targets first and then flags and pen-
nants.

The theory behind the swing target (see Exhibit 16.6) is that
if the market advances, or declines, vigorously, and then there
is a retracement of this move, the next leg of the move should
be at least equal to the move of the previous channel.

This is shown in Exhibit 16.6 where the height of the first leg
is a rally from A to B. There is then a correction to C. Once the
market ascends from C, we would “swing” the initial channel
height of A to B onto the correction low at C. Hence, the name
“swing target.”

Swing targets are very similar in concept to flags and pen-
nants. The major difference is that corrections in a swing target
are more substantial than flags or pennants. As shown in
Exhibit 16.7, flags are lateral, or small countertrend, moves after

a clearly defined sharp advance or decline. This congestion
band serves to relieve an overbought (in a rally) or oversold (in
a decline) condition. If, after this short-term correction, the mar-
ket resumes its prior trend, we then have a flag or pennant pat-
tern.

The difference between flags and pennants is that in a flag,
the “flag” portion is a horizontal box range. In a pennant pat-
tern, the “flag” portion (i.e., the congestion band) looks like a
pennant because it has lower highs and higher lows.

Exhibits 16.7 and 16.8 show the measurements of the bull and
bear flags and pennants. Their measuring implications are built
on the same concept as that of the swing target. For the flag or
pennant pattern, we use the vertical height of the initial
advance or decline—nicknamed the “flagpole.”

In Exhibit 16.7 we see bull flag and pennant’s price targets
are derived by adding the height of the initial sharp advance
(the flagpole) from A to B onto the bottom end of the congestion
band (which is either a flag or pennant shape). The more tradi-

tional method is adding this flagpole’s height to the top of the
flag or pennant. I prefer to err on exiting too early rather than
missing the last few ticks. As such, my measurement starts
from the bottom of the flag or pennant rather than the top.

As shown in Exhibit 16.8, the bear flag or pennant objective
is forecasted by subtracting the flagpole (A-B) range from the
top of the congestion band. (Again, this is my subjective con-
servative target—others will use the more classic measurement
from the bottom of the congestion band.)

In Exhibit 16.9 there is an almost vertical rally from 1 to 2 that
took the stock from $22.50 to $27.50. The decline from 2 to A
was almost exactly a Fibonacci 61.8% correction of this rally.
(See Chapter 12 for discussions on retracements.) The stock
started its advance from A.

Using the 1 to 2 rally and the correction to A, we can obtain
a swing target by taking the $5 move from 1 to 2 and adding
that to the correction low of A at $ 24.50. This gives a potential
target to $29.50.

While measured moves do not only normally become resis-
tance or support, in this example we see how a bearish engulf-

ing pattern (at B) on February 1 and 2 emerged at this project-
ed $29.50 price target.

In Exhibit 16.10 we see that after the ascent from A to B, the
stock took a breather for about a week. During this time the
market moved into a box range between $36.50 and $37.75. A
rising window opened on July 11 (after candle line C) and pro-
pelled the stock above the aforementioned lateral trading
range.

From a candlestick perspective, this rising window did two
things: First, it turns the trend north, and second, this window
now becomes potential support. While this window gives us a
positive bias, it does not provide an upside target. For this, we
shift to the Western technicals. Looking at the rally from A to B
and the correction to C, we have a bull flag pattern. Now we
can get a target by adding the “flagpole” portion (A to B) to the
bottom of the “flag” (at C). The A to B rally is about $ 5.50.
Putting this onto the low at C gives an upside target toward
$42. (As mentioned above, most books on Western technical
analysis will add this $5.50 to the top of the flag portion [near

$38], but I use the more conservative measurement of the bot-
tom of the flag [$36.50] portion of a bull flag.)

As the stock approached our conservative $42 target, a shoot-
ing star arose overhead, making the target a resistance area. The
black candle after the shooting star completed the third line
needed for an evening star pattern. The descent from there
found support in late July near $37.75. This was a support area
defined by the rising window on July 14 with the inverted ham-
mers. The rally that started the week of July 28 hesitated at the
high of the aforementioned evening star pattern at around $42.
As discussed with an evening star (and many other candle pat-
terns), I normally look at resistance based on the close. Thus,
when the stock pushed above the evening star’s resistance
intraday, but failed to close above it, this resistance remained
intact.

Exhibit 16.11 highlights two shooting stars at A. This denotes
hesitation near the 925-950 area. The steep fall from A to B hes-
itated with a long-legged doji at B. From there, the index
ascended slightly. This helped mitigate what was an oversold

condition. By looking at the A to B decline as a flagpole and the
triangular range at B and C as a pennant, we have a bear pen-
nant formation.

Once the bottom end of the pennant was broken, we can
derive a target by taking the decline from A to B from the minor
correction high at C near 775. This gives a downside target
toward 525 which was exceeded.

A variation of a piercing pattern arose near 500 at P. It was a
variation because the white candle did not get more than
halfway into the black real body. However, since this was the
first white candle and higher close of the entire decline from C,
I would still view this variation as important as a classic pierc-
ing pattern. This outlook was validated the following week by
the successful defense of the piercing pattern’s support.

There are many types of triangles in Western technicals: sym-
metrical triangles, wedges, and so on. As shown in Exhibit
16.12, there are ascending and descending triangles.

The ascending triangle has a horizontal resistance area tested
numerous times. Moves down from this resistance are at
sequentially higher lows. This exemplifies that, although there
is supply at the resistance line, demand is getting more aggres-
sive as the market pulls back from this resistance area. If the
bulls can then push the market over the horizontal resistance,
we have an ascending triangle. The measurement is the height

from the horizontal resistance area (A) to the widest part of the
triangles (at B) added to the just-broken resistance area.

The descending triangle is a pattern wherein a horizontal sup-
port area is successfully defended, but each rally from there
meets with successively lower highs. These lower highs reflect
how the bears are keeping the bulls well in check. With a pen-
etration of support, we take the widest point of the descending
triangle and add that measurement from the prior support line.

Exhibit 16.13 displays a classic descending triangle. The hor-
izontal line at 137 shows it was a clearly defined multitested
support. This was the bottom part of the descending triangle.
The upper part of the descending triangle was a downward
sloping resistance line.

Once the bears had the wherewithal to pull the market under
the 137 support area (at the arrow), we now use the ascending
triangle projection. The highest point of the triangle is when it
began at 138.25. The bottom end of the triangle is 137. This pro-
vides us with a target toward 135.75.

One of the attractive aspects of the descending triangle is that
we can use the prior support area as new resistance (the change
of polarity). Consequently, once the bears pulled prices under
137 (at the arrow), we then know that 137—if the market is
indeed weak—should become resistance.

Further corroboration of trouble with the move under 137
was the falling window the next session. Consequently, we
have a convergence of factors for resistance near 137: the prior
support and the falling window.

not project the extent of correction after the market turned down.

1. An ascending resistance line obtained by connecting the
highs from the week of February 14 to the highs in early
March (this technique is discussed in Chapter 11). Since the
NASDAQ was in uncharted territory, this rising resistance
line was a useful mechanism to obtain a potential supply
area as the market ascended.

2. A shooting star (Chapter 4) on March 10 was a candlestick
signal confirming the potential resistance at the rising resis-
tance line discussed above.

3. See Exhibit 17.1a. This is an hourly chart that shows a bear-
ish engulfing pattern (Chapter 4) on March 10 (at 3). This
bearish engulfing pattern emerged early the same day as the
shooting star of the daily chart (discussed in point 2 above).

4. Returning to Exhibit 17.1, at the time the NASDAQ made
new highs at the shooting star at 2, the oscillator (Chapter 14)
made a lower high. This was bearish divergence.

5. A very small falling window opened between the sessions of
March 10 and 13 (Chapter 7). This falling window is more
evident in Exhibit 17.1a on the hourly chart. Once this falling
window opened, it turned the trend southward. It then
becomes potential resistance. The decline from this falling
window found some stabilization at a hammer (Chapter 4)
on March 16. This hammer became support a few days later,
from where a rally ensued.

6. The rally that began on March 21 stalled at the window’s
resistance (from point 5 above) with a high-wave candle
(Chapter 8). Although the upper shadow of the candle line at
6 moved over the window’s resistance, the failure to close
above this window reinforced the major resistance area
between 5050 and 5150.

Based on the above, we have the major convergence of candle
signals, including the shooting star, bearish engulfing pattern,
falling window, and high-wave candle, with the Western signals
of a rising resistance line and bearish divergence. This cluster of
signals converging in the 5050-5150 area greatly strengthened
the prognosis that the NASDAQ had reached a ceiling.

Be flexible about chart reading. Where you stand in relation
to the overall technical evidence may be more important than
an individual candle pattern. For example, a bullish candle sig-
nal in a major bear market should not be used as a buy signal.
A bullish candle formation, especially when confirmed by
other technical signals in a bull market, would be a buying
point.

Also consider the risk/reward aspect of a potential trade.
Just because there is a candle signal does not mean one should
trade on it.

Candles, as all other charting methods, require subjectivity.
You are a doctor of the market. How you read and react to the
symptoms of the market’s health through candles techniques
may not be the same as another candle practitioner. How you
trade with candles will depend on your trading philosophy,
your risk adversity, and your temperament. There are very

the same as a Western island top or bottom in which the
island session is also a doji.

Advance block—A variation of the three white soldiers in which
the last two soldiers (i.e., white real bodies) display weaken-
ing upside drive. This weakness could be in the form of tall
upper shadows or progressively smaller real bodies. It signi-
fies a diminution of buying force or an increase in selling
pressure.

I Belt-hold line—There are bullish and bearish belt-holds. A bullish

belt-hold is a tall white candlestick that opens on, or near, its
low and closes well above the opening price. It is also called
a white opening shaven bottom. A bearish belt-hold is a long
black candlestick that opens on, or near, its high and closes
well off its open. Also referred to as a black opening shaven
head.

Candlestick lines and charts—Traditional Japanese charts whose

individual lines look like candles, hence their name.

jee Body Candlestick charts are also called “candle charts.” The can-

Lower dlestick line is comprised of a real body and shadows. See
Shadow Real body and Shadows.

Counterattack Lines Counterattack lines—Following a black (white) candle in a

downtrend (uptrend), the market gaps sharply lower (high-
er) on the opening and then closes unchanged from the prior
session’s close. A pattern that reflects a stalemate between the
bulls and bears and thus lessens the force in place before the
emergence of the counterattack line.

Bullish Bear-
ish

i

Dark-Cloud Cover

Dark-cloud cover—A bearish reversal signal. In an uptrend a
long white candlestick is followed by a black candlestick that
opens above the prior white candlestick’s high (or close) and
then closes well into the white candlestick’s real body—
preferably more than halfway. The bullish counterpart of the
dark-cloud cover is the piercing pattern.

Dead cross—A bearish signal given when a short-term moving
average crosses under a longer-term moving average. Its
bullish counterpart is the golden cross.

Deliberation pattern—See Stalled pattern.

where the opening and closing are in relation to the entire
range. Doji lines are among the most important individual
candlestick lines. They are also components of candlestick
patterns. Northern doji are doji that appear during a rally.
Southern doji are doji during declines.

Doji star—A doji that gaps from a long white or black candle’s
real body.

Downside gap tasuki—See Tasuki gaps.

Dragonfly doji A doji with a long lower shadow and where
the open, high, and close are at the session’s high. See the
illustration under Doji. The opposite version of this is the
gravestone doji.

Dumpling tops—Similar to the Western rounding top. A win-
dow to the downside is needed to confirm this as a top. Its
bullish opposite is the frypan bottom.

Engulfing patterns—A bullish engulfing pattern is comprised of a
large white real body that engulfs a small black real body in
a downtrend. A bearish engulfing pattern occurs when selling
pressure overwhelms buying force as reflected by a long
black real body engulfing a small white real body in an
uptrend.

Evening doji star—See Evening star.

Evening star—A top reversal pattern formed by three candle
lines. The first is a tall white real body, the second is a small
real body (white or black) that gaps above the first real body
to form a star, and the third is a black candle that closes well
into the first session’s white real body. If the middle portion
of this pattern is a doji instead of a spinning top, it is an
evening doji star. The opposite of the evening star is the morn-
ing star pattern.

idates via a series of small real bodies near the recent highs.
If prices gap above this consolidation area, it becomes a high-
price gapping play. 2. Low-price gapping play—After a sharp
price decline, the market consolidates via a series of small
real bodies near the recent lows. If prices gap under this con-
solidation, it is a sell signal.

Golden cross—A bullish signal in which a shorter-term moving
average crosses above a longer-term moving average. It is the
opposite of the dead cross.

Gravestone doji—A doji in which the opening and closing are at
the low of the session. It is a reversal signal at tops. See the
illustration under Doji. The opposite of this doji is the drag-
onfly doji.

Hammer—An important bottoming candlestick line. The ham-
mer and the hanging man are both the same lines that are
generally called umbrella lines; that is, a small real body
(white or black) at the top of the session’s range and a very
long lower shadow with little or no upper shadow. When
this line appears during a downtrend, it becomes a bullish
hammer. For a classic hammer, the lower shadow should be
at least twice the height of the real body.

Hanging Man

Hanging man—A top reversal that requires confirmation. The
hanging man and the hammer are both the same type of can-
diestick line (i.e., a small real body [white or black], with lit-
tle or no upper shadow, at the top of the session’s range and
a very long lower shadow). But when this line appears dur-
ing an uptrend, it becomes a bearish hanging man. It signals
the market has become vulnerable, but there should be bear-
ish confirmation the next session with an open, and better is
a close, under the hanging man’s real body. In principle, the
hanging man’s lower shadow should be two or three times
the height of the real body.

Harami Harami—A two-candlestick pattern in which a small real body
holds within the prior session’s unusually large real body.

| b The harami implies the immediately preceding trend is con-
cluded, and the bulls and bears are now in a state of truce.

The color of the second real body can be white or black. Most
often the second real body is the opposite color of the first
real body.

line. It is also called a petrifying pattern.

High-price gapping play—See Gapping plays.

High-wave candle—A candle with very long upper and lower
shadows and a small real body. It shows that the market is
losing its direction bias that it had before this candle
appeared. If the real body is a doji instead of a small real
body, it is a long-legged doji.

High Waves

In-neck line—A small white candlestick in a downtrend whose
close is slightly above the previous black candlestick’s low of Inv Neck
the session. After this white candlestick’s low is broken, the
downtrend should continue. Compare to on-neck line, thrust-
ing line, and piercing pattern.

Emi

Inverted hammer—Following a downtrend, this is a candlestick
line that has a long upper shadow and a small real body at Inverted Hammer
the lower end of the session. There should be no, or very lit- |
tle, lower shadow. It has the same shape as the bearish shoot- |
ing star, but when this line occurs in a downtrend, it is a I
bullish bottom reversal signal with confirmation the next ses-
sion (Le., a candlestick with a higher open and especially a
higher close compared to the inverted hammer’s close).

Inverted three Buddha pattern—See Three Buddha pattern.

Long-legged doji—A doji with very long shadows. If the opening
and closing of a long-legged doji session are in the middle of
the session’s range, the line is called a rickshaw man. See illus-
tration under Doji.

star, and the third is a white candlestick that closes well into
the first session’s black real body. Its opposite is the evening
star. If the middle candle (the star portion) is a doji instead of
a spinning top, the pattern becomes a morning doji star.

Night attack—The Japanese expression for a large order placed
at the close to try to affect the market.

Northern Doji—See Doji.

On-neck line—A black candlestick in a downtrend is followed
by a small white candlestick whose close is near the low of
the session of the black candlestick. It is a bearish continua-
tion pattern. The market should continue to move lower after
the white candlestick’s low is broken. Compare to an in-neck
line, a thrusting line, and a piercing pattern.

Petrifying pattern—The nickname for the harami cross.

Piercing Pattern Piercing pattern—A bottom reversal signal. In a downtrend, a
long black candlestick is followed by a gap lower open dur-
ing the next session. This session finishes as a strong white
candlestick that closes more than halfway into the prior black
candlestick’s real body. Compare to the on-neck line, the in-
neck line, and the thrusting line.

Raindrop—See Star.

Real body—The rectangular part of the candlestick line. It is
defined by the closing and opening prices of the session.
When the close is higher than the open, the real body is white
(or empty). A black (or filled-in) real body is when the close
is lower than the opening. See the illustration under
Candlestick lines and charts.

Glossary A * Candlestick Terms and Visual Dictionary 275

The lower shadow is the line under the real body. The bottom
of the lower shadow is the low of the session. The upper
shadow is the line on top of the real body. The top of the
upper shadow is the high of the session. See the illustration
under Candlestick lines and charts.

Shaven bottom—A candlestick with no lower shadow.
Shooting Star

Shaven head—A candlestick with no upper shadow.

Shooting star—A bearish candle with a long upper shadow, lit-
tle or no lower shadow, and a small real body near the lows
of the session that arises after an uptrend.

Side-by-side white lines—Two consecutive white candlesticks
that have the same open and whose real bodies are about the
same size. In an uptrend, if these side-by-side white lines gap
higher, it is a bullish continuation pattern. In a downtrend,
these side-by-side white lines are still considered bearish (in
spite of their white candles since they come after a falling
gap).

Southern doji—See Doji.

Spinning tops—The nickname for candle lines with small real
bodies.

Star—A small real body (white or black) that gaps away from
the large real body preceding it. A star in a downtrend has
the nickname raindrop.

Tasuki gaps—The upward (or upside) gapping tasuki is made of a
rising window formed by a white candle and then a black
candle. The black candle opens within the white real body
and closes under the white candle’s real body. The close on
the black candle day is the fight point. A downward (or down-
side) gapping tasuki is when the market gaps down with a
black candle followed by a white candle. The two candles of
the tasuki should be about the same size. Both types of tasu-
ki are rare.

Three Buddha patterns—A three Buddha top is the same as the
Western head and shoulders top. In Japanese terms, the three
Buddha top is a three mountain top in which the central moun-
tain is the tallest. An inverted three Buddha is the same as the
Western inverted head and shoulders. In Japanese terminol-

ogy, it is a three river bottom in which the middle river is the
longest.

Three crows—Three relatively long consecutive black candles
that close near or on their lows. It is a top reversal at a high-
price level or after an extended rally.

Three methods—There are two types. The first is the falling three
methods, which is a bearish continuation pattern. It is ideally
comprised of five lines. A long black real body is followed by
three small, usually white, real bodies that hold within the
first session’s high-low range. Then a black candlestick clos-
es at a new low for the move. The rising three methods is a
bullish continuation pattern. A tall white candlestick pre-
cedes three small, usually black, real bodies that hold within
the white candlestick’s range. The fifth line of this pattern is
a strong white candlestick that closes at a new high for the
move.

Three mountain top—A longer-term topping pattern in which
prices stall at, or near, the same highs.

Three river bottom—When the market hits a bottom area three
times.

Three white or three advancing soldiers—This is a group of three
white candlesticks with consecutively higher closes (with
each closing near the highs of the session). These three white
candles presage more strength if they appear after a period of
stable prices or at a low price area.

Thrusting line—A white candlestick that closes in the prior
black real body, but still under the middle of the prior ses-
sion’s real body. The thrusting line is stronger than an in-
neck line, but not so strong as a piercing line. In a downtrend,
the thrusting line is viewed as bearish (unless two of these
patterns appear within a few days of each other). As part of
a rising market, it is considered bullish.

Towers—There is a tower top and a tower bottom. The tower top, a
top reversal formation, is comprised of one or more tall white
candles followed by congestion and then one or more long
black candlesticks. It is a pattern that looks like it has towers
on both sides of the congestion band. A tower bottom is a bot-
tom reversal pattern. One or more long black candles are fol-
lowed by lateral action. Then the market explodes to the
upside via one or more long white candlesticks.

Tri-star—Three doji that have the same formation as a morning
or evening star pattern. An extraordinarily rare pattern.

Tweezers top and bottom—When the same highs or lows are test-
ed on back-to-back sessions. They are minor reversal signals
that take on extra importance if the two candlesticks that
comprise the tweezers pattern also form another candlestick
indicator. For example, if both sessions of a harami cross
have the same high, it could have more significance since
there would be a tweezers top and a bearish harami cross
made by the same two candlestick lines.

Umbrella lines—The generic name for the hammer and hanging
man lines. The umbrella line looks like an umbrella since it is
a candle with a long lower shadow and a small real body at,
or near, the top of the trading range.

Upper shadow—See Shadows.
Upside gap tasuki—See Tasuki gaps.

Upside gap two crows—A three-candlestick pattern. The first line
is a long white candlestick that is followed by a black real
body that gaps over the white candle’s real body. The third
session is another black real body that opens above the sec-
ond session’s open and closes under the second session’s
close. It is very rare.

Window-—The same as a Western gap. Windows are continua-
tion patterns. When the market opens a window to the
upside, it is a rising window. It is a bullish signal and the ris-
ing window should be support. If a window opens in a sell-
off, it is a falling window. This is a bearish signal. The falling
window is resistance.

GLOSSARY B
WESTERN

TECHNICAL TE RMS —

Th glossary is to clarify the Western technical terms used in
this book. It is not meant to be comprehensive or detailed,
as this book focuses on Japanese candlesticks, not Western
technicals.

Bar chart—A graphic representation of price activity. The high
and low of the session define the top and bottom of a vertical
line. The close for the period is marked with a short horizon-
tal bar attached to the right of the vertical line. The open is
marked with a short horizontal bar attached to the left of the
vertical line. Price is on the vertical scale; time is on the hori-
zontal scale.

Blow-offs—A top or bottom reversal. Blow-offs occur after an
extended move. Prices sharply and quickly thrust strongly in
the direction of the preceding trend. If the market reverses
after this action, it is a blow-off.

Box range—The Japanese term for a market in a lateral trading
range. See Congestion zone or band.

Glossary B © Western Technical Terms

Breakaway gap—When prices gap away from a significant tech-
nical area (i.e., a trend line or a congestion zone).

Breakout—Overcoming a resistance or support level.

Change of polarity—When old support converts to new resis-
tance, or when old resistance converts to new support.

Confirmation—When more than one indicator substantiates the
action of another.

Congestion zone or band—A period of lateral price action within
a relatively narrow price band. The Japanese call this a box
range.

Consolidation—The same as a congestion zone. Consolidation,
however, has the implication that the prior trend should
resume.

Continuation pattern—A pattern whose implications are for a
continuation of the prior trend. A flag, for instance, is a con-
tinuation pattern.

Crossover—When the faster indicator crosses above (bullish
crossover) or below (bearish crossover) the slower indicator.
For example, if a 5-day moving average crosses under a 13-
day moving average, it is a bearish crossover.

Divergence—When related technical indicators fail to confirm a
price move. For instance, if prices reach new highs and
stochastics do not, this is negative divergence and is bearish.
If prices establish new lows and stochastics do not make new
lows, this is called positive divergence and is bullish.

Double bottom—Price action that resembles a W in which price
declines twice stop at, or near, the same lows.

Double top—Price action that resembles an M in which price ral-
lies twice stop at, or near, the same highs.

Downgap—When prices gap lower.

Downtrend—A market that is trending lower as shown by a
series of lower highs and/or lower lows.

Exponential moving average—A moving average that is exponen-
tially weighted.

Falling resistance line—A resistance line made by joining a series
of lower highs.

Falling support line—A support line obtained by connecting a
series of lower lows.

Fibonacci—Italian mathematician who formulated a series of
numbers based on adding the prior two numbers. Popular
Fibonacci ratios used by technicians include (rounding off)
38%, 50%, and 62%.

Flag or pennant—A continuation formation comprised of a
sharp price move followed by a brief consolidation area.
These are continuation patterns.

Gap—A price void (i.e., no trading), from one price area to
another.

Inside session—When the entire session’s high-low range is
within the prior session’s range.

Intraday—Any period shorter than daily. Thus, a 60-minute
intraday chart is based on the high, low, open, and “close” on
an hourly basis.

Islands—A formation at the extremes of the market when prices
gap in the direction of the prior trend. Prices then stay there
for one or more days, and then gaps in the opposite direction.
Prices are thus surrounded by gaps that leave them isolated
like an island.

Measured moves—A price target based on using measurements
formulated on prior price action.

Momentum—tThe velocity of a price move. It compares the most
recent close to the close a specific number of periods ago.

Moving average convergence—divergence (MACD) oscillator—A
combination of three exponentially smoothed moving aver-
ages.

Neckline—A line connecting the lows of the head in a head and
shoulders formation, or the highs of an inverse head and
shoulders. A move under the neckline of a head and shoul-
ders top is bearish; a move above the neckline of an inverse
head and shoulders neckline is bullish.

Negative divergence—See Divergence.

Oscillator—A momentum line that fluctuates around a zero
value line (or between 0% and 100%). Oscillators can help

measure overbought/oversold levels, show negative and
positive divergence, and measure a price move’s velocity.

Overbought—When the market moves up too far, too fast. At
this point the market is vulnerable to a downward correction.

Oversold—When the market declines too quickly. The market
becomes susceptible to a bounce.

Paper trading—Not trading with real money. All transactions
are only imaginary with a record of profit and loss on paper.

Pennant—See Flag.

Positive divergence—See Divergence.

Rally—An upward movement of prices.

Reaction—A price movement opposite of the prevailing trend.

Relative Strength Index (RSI)—The RSI compares the ratio of up
closes to down closes over a specified time period.

Resistance level—A level where sellers are expected to enter.

Retracement—A price reaction from the prior move in percent-
age terms. The more common retracement levels are 38.2%,
50%, and 61.8%.

Reversal indicator—See Trend reversals.

Reversal session—A session when a new high is made for the
move and the market then closes under the prior session’s
close.

Rising resistance line—A resistance line made by connecting
higher highs.

Rising support line—A support line connecting higher lows.

Selling climax—When prices push sharply and suddenly lower
on heavy volume after an extended decline. If the market
reverses from this sharp sell-off, it is viewed as a selling cli-
max.

Selloff—A downward movement of prices.

Simple moving average—A method of smoothing price data in
which prices are added together and then averaged. It is a
“moving” average because the average moves. As new price
data is added, the oldest data is dropped.

Glossary B * Western Technical Terms

Spring—When prices break under the support of a horizontal
congestion band and then springs back above the “broken
support” area. This is bullish and there is a measured price
target to the upper end of the congestion band.

Stochastics—An oscillator that measures the relative position of
the closing price as compared with its range over a chosen
period. It is comprised of the faster moving %K line and the
slower moving %D line.

Support level—An area where buyers are expected to enter.

Swing target—Using the height of a rally or decline to obtain a
price target.

Trading range—When prices are locked between horizontal sup-
port and horizontal resistance levels.

Trend—The market’s prevalent price direction.

Trend line—A line on a chart that connects a series of higher
highs or lower lows. At least two points are needed to draw
a trend line. The more often it is tested and the greater the
volume on the tests, the more important the trend line.

Trend reversals—A\so called reversal indicators. This is a mislead-
ing term. More appropriate, and more accurate, would be the
term “trend change indicator.” It means the prior trend
should change. It does not mean prices are going to reverse.
Prices might reverse after a trend reversal pattern, but they
may not. For example, the trend could change from upwards
to sideways. As long as the trend changes after a trend rever-
sal pattern appears, that trend reversal worked. Thus, if a
trend reversal appears during an uptrend and the market
then trades sideways, the trend reversal pattern was success-

ful.
Upgap—A gap that pushes prices higher.

Upthrust—When prices break above a resistance line from a lat-
erally trading zone. If these new highs fail to hold and prices
pull back under the “broken” resistance line, it is an
upthrust. The target is for a retest of the lower end of the
recent trading zone.

Uptrend—A market that is trending higher.

V bottom or top—When prices suddenly reverse direction, form-
ing a price pattern that looks like the letter V for a bottom or
an inverted V for a top.

Volume—The total of all contracts traded for a given period.

Weighted moving average—A moving average in which each pre-
vious price is assigned a weighting factor. Usually the most
recent data is the more heavily weighted and thus considered
more important.
