"m0egkd1","1h6fl9r","t1_m0ecsf1","on a molecular level ethane is pretty simple its a chain of two carbon atoms surrounded by six hydrogen atoms veser says by itself ethane is not all that useful which is why it has to be processed by a socalled cracker

before it gets to the plant the ethane is separated from methanethe main component of natural gas which is used to heat homes and generate electricity then at the cracker the ethane gets put into tubes and is heated to around 1500 degrees thats when things start to get interesting

as you heat it up you basically make this molecule wiggle around more and more wildly veser says

when this happens the bonds holding its atoms together stretch and get weaker

you can almost imagine it like when you have two kids and they hold arms and swing each other around if they get too crazy and too wild at some point they just cant hold onto each other and they fly apart

this cracking or breaking of the molecular bonds causes the atoms to rearrange themselves in particular ethanes two carbon atoms form a double bond with one another resulting in a new molecule ethylene

veser says its this double bond which makes ethylene so useful it reacts easily with other chemicals and can be strung together into long molecular chainssort of like legos and when you snap all these ethylene molecules together you get polyethylenethe ubiquitous plastic found in everything from milk containers to medical devices

these will likely be the units that are removed during replacement when their batteries degrade and their max capacity is too reduced  at that point they have to remove it and swap it with a new unit  the old one can now be refurbished with a new battery cell and reused after sterilization which because its all inorganic can include a variety of very thorough techniques including heat vaporization without damaging the components

the units in individuals who have deceased i believe are removed as they contain lipo cells and thats still a hazard  however those units will likely be recycled entirely although i have been surprised in the past by thirst for profits","ajnozari","2024-12-05 01:40:30","1"

we currently give used devices that have neared erirrt to vet hospitals for animals to have basic ppm functions

the idea of refurbishing these devices would greatly help other countries with poor access to health care resources and as an alternative for those who must pay for care andor need them for a short time","ImmediateFail7921","2024-12-05 01:44:03","1"

given that cancer is incredibly messy especially metastatic or aggressive cancers its not too far beyond the imagination that maternal dna can be interpreted as well where youll see a mess of genetic errors this is the cancer which does not have any care for its replication

the two proba3 satellites launched from india at 534 am est 1034 utc thursday riding a polar satellite launch vehicle pslv the pslv released proba3 into a stretchedout orbit with a low point approximately 356 miles 573 kilometers a high point of 37632 miles 60563 kilometers and an inclination of 59 degrees to the equator

after initial checkouts the two proba3 satellites each smaller than a compact car will separate from one another to begin their tech demo experiments early next year the larger of the two satellites known as the coronagraph spacecraft carries a suite of science instruments to image the suns corona or outer atmosphere the smaller spacecraft named occulter hosts navigation sensors and lowimpulse thrusters to help it maneuver into position less than 500 feet 150 meters from its coronagraph companion

from the point of view of the coronagraph spacecraft this is just the right distance for a 46foot 14meter disk mounted to proba3s occulter spacecraft to obscure the surface of the sun the occultation will block the suns blinding glare and cast a shadow just 3 inches 8 centimeters onto the coronagraph satellite revealing the wispy superheated gases that make up the solar corona","Sariel007","2024-12-06 13:15:03","4"

alzheimers has been a such barren space with zero truly effective drugs so anything that showed a slight hope in delaying the disease got tons of press 

unfortunately most of these promising drugs never reaches the market as they fail final stage clinical trial in other words dont show enough efficacy 

furthermore even the newer options come with challenges like the need to start early which is almost impossible as alzheimers diagnosis usually happens once the disease has already progressed 

the dream would be a drug that reverses the disease but thats likely impossible unless we can figure out some sort of regenerative medicine 

short of that a drug that can actually stop the progression would be huge","Maliwali1980","2024-12-06 16:57:15","2"

but hey now that trump is in you will see just how much you can move backwards away from progressive policies in 4 years the largest wealth transfer happened under trump for what he was doing on purpose his cabinet is filled with millionaires and billionaires and the project 2025 author is also on the cabinet roe has already been stripped 

you are upset with status quo had trump lost it would have forced the republicans to move in a different direction then you could have had a bigger push for a progressive candidate in the future now politicians are going to learn from trump they can lie and get away with crimes and when it comes to future elections the general population is going to back more centrist candidates especially since so many young people voted for trump 

the real question is in the next decade do we even make it back to today status quo probably not very likely and we have 3 potential pandemics possibly coming i dare you to revisit this thought in 3 years","Traditional-Goal-229","2024-12-06 17:20:34","0"

dont worry though you will get to see things will get so much worse then you can tell me how we should fix the system as not a single person in power does that

i saw democrats whine about hillary when she lost there were plenty of progressives that said they didnt want the establishment so who won the primaries the next election biden an establishment politician who did they run next harris tell me do you think the democrats are going more progressive you really think a progressive is winning even the primary 

are you seeing what trump is doing he wants to change voting laws remove half the federal workers which will gut most of the power for them to run he might be the least progressive candidate in decades when you are paying more because of the tariffs and deportation remember its not your fault you only voted for this but you broke the status quo and when both parties again run an establishment candidate its their fault for not listening to you","Traditional-Goal-229","2024-12-06 18:42:06","0"

again if your big complaint was inflation and you dont really say much but complete generalization so i am mostly guessing after it was handled better here than anywhere else you wont like trumps response and it isnt going to lead to the democrats going more progressive congrats on having no plan and just reacting and whining next time why dont you actually come to a protest join an organization and actually try to push a candidate or you could just do what you do","Traditional-Goal-229","2024-12-07 00:46:18","0"

in this case its not hot the actual decay of c14 releasing a particle to become nitrogen releases an electron so it  would be like you would just put a red and black clamp on the diamond and get a tiny stream of electricity coming out of it","MDCCCLV","2024-12-07 02:49:15","1"

the negatively charged beta particle is actually an electron the emitted electron is conducted away by the surrounding conductive carbon 12 crystal lattice also known as diamond the carbon 14 that decayed now has 7 protons and 7 neutrons which is the predominant stable isotope of nitrogen 14

what does this even mean

so what is the actual novelty 

a more energy efficient way of separating them 

i think the author didnt understand the paperpress release and skipped over paraphrasing the actual discovery part of the discovery





my hypothesis before i go hunting down the paper is it has something to do with the photocatalyst where it not only splits the molecule but also capturesbinds the hydrogen so the oxygen can be extracted on its own the reaction can then be reversed freeing the hydrogen without the need for expensive seperation steps like liquifyingdistallation or centrifugal seperation

there are two seperate photocatalytic process happening simultaneously if im understanding correctly  one is capturing oxygen releasing hydrogen the other is capturing hydrogen releasing oxygen","Annon201","2024-12-10 13:48:41","1"

what is significant is that the encryption process is three steps normally this is a lot of computations but using a fefet instead allows them to reduce this into one step using a specialized array of devices this would be a dedicated communication chip  huge time and power savings 

the device works on a larger voltage range than typical and i think they were using that to manage one of the stepsvariables in the encryption process  its also persistent

normally to combine three arrays of variables in math you have to do it with loops in loops but now one loop is done for you in the voltage ranges established in the fefet array of voltages

homomorphic encryption is like a magical lockbox for data heres how it works in simple terms

	1	you lock up your data imagine putting your data into a special box and locking it with a key only you have the key

	2	others can still work with the locked box even though the box is locked someone else like a computer or a service can do useful calculations with the stuff inside it without unlocking it for example they could add or multiply numbers inside the box without ever seeing what the numbers are

	3	you unlock the box to see the result when the calculations are done you use your key to unlock the box and see the answer

the magic here is that your data stays private the entire timeits like letting someone bake a cake with ingredients in a sealed bag but they never see the ingredients themselves","kaimonster1966","2024-12-11 15:15:35","0"

corrosion is a problem but not insurmountable given the demand for clean green energy

erosion 

erosion of what the seabed

transmitting power 

so existing wind turbines that are already in sea farms are compromised by transmitting power limitations whod have known best stop putting them out at sea then

eyesore

what for who the odd scuba diver who gets sucked into a turbine or is that covered by wildlife as well

in case you missed the point my proposal is for underwater turbines so where you cant even see them or even know they were there unlike the current seabased wind turbines which are very evident and could be considered an eyesore to some except theyre providing a vital service

in fact i think a trick was missed with siting wind turbines at sea and they should have incorporated tidal turbines in their bases to give a predictable power generation for when wind conditions arent suitable

this was totally unexpected said yinming shao lead author on the studyhttpsjournalsapsorgprxabstract101103physrevx14041057 we werent even looking for a semidirac fermion when we started working with this material but we were seeing signatures we didnt understand  and it turns out we had made the first observation of these wild quasiparticles that sometimes move like they have mass and sometimes move like they have none

it sounds like an impossible feat  how can something gain and lose mass readily but it actually comes back to that classic formula that everyones heard of but many might not understand  e  mc2 this describes the relationship between a particles energy e and mass m with the speed of light c squared

according to einsteins theory of special relativity nothing that has any mass can reach the speed of light because it would take an infinite amount of energy to accelerate it to that speed but a funny thing happens when you flip that on its head  if a massless particle slows down from the speed of light it actually gains mass

and thats whats happening here when the quasiparticles travel along one dimension inside the zrsis crystals they do so at the speed of light and are therefore massless but as soon as they try to travel in a different direction they hit resistance slow down and gain mass","chrisdh79","2024-12-12 14:05:14","1"

"m1rlm7c","1hclrpw","t1_m1p9hyn","during refraction the light does indeed travel at a different speed relative to the obesever who is experiancing a different speed of light  the speed of the light remains constant to the light itself

in the example  posted if what they observed is correct the particle is traveling within the crystal at its own relative speed of light then when it exits whatever matrix its in its relative speed drops to zero or at least to some  non relativistic speed when this happens the weightless particle suddenly has mass

this is exactly what should happen if their observations are correct a particle that loses speed would gain mass  the phenomena bears a resemblence to refraction on the surface but with refraction the particle doesnt actually change speed  speed only seems different to someone observing the light as it traveles a longer path through thicker media but in the op it seems to be traveling the matrix of the crystal then losing all speed when it exits

my claim is that your original intent was to be very dismissive of this particular battery research breakthrough and battery research articles in general 

source your comments 

when you were called out on it and it was pointed out that this wasnt a no name science puff piece but posted by one of the biggest engineering organisations in the world you decided to try and save face by claiming that your comments were meant to be taken in a positive light

no we all know what you were doing you just didnt expect to have your ass handed to you and youre unsure of what to do when youve been caught out being very wrong and havent learned to accept losing with grace maybe next time

you cant find a single quote of mine disparaging ieee or denying progress in battery technology but youre so determined to read it that way and so defensive over your special interest area that youre choosing to infer commentary that wasnt made

best of luck in that

to your point though i am dismissive of a lot of battery articles which are literally corporate investment pitches which ive said in at least two other comments because they present breakthroughs in a way which might mislead average readers about their presentday viability i point out that many though i was careful not to say all battery technology articles present research in sensational ways which dont reflect meaningful information in the present such as decades of this food cures cancer articles which present correlation as causation to sell an accompanying fad

nobody however seems willing to speak on the subject i was initially referring to perhaps i phrased it less than adequately but thats the conversation i intended to have

you however still cant produce the evidence which supports your claim all you basically have said boils down to i feel like you meant this but i cant actually prove it so way to go joeh2shmoe you win a prize","APRobertsVII","2024-12-12 23:58:32","0"

"m1td5tw","1hclrpw","t1_m1r8m7q","the doubleslit experiment is a famous demonstration that reveals the waveparticle duality of light and matter heres how it works

imagine you have a light source shining toward a barrier with two parallel slits on the other side of the barrier is a screen that can record where the light hits if light were purely a particle youd expect to see two bright lines on the screen corresponding to the two slits

however what actually happens is that the light creates an interference pattern on the screen consisting of multiple bright and dark bands this interference pattern suggests that the light is behaving like a wave with waves from each slit overlapping and interfering with each other

when you perform this experiment with particles like electrons they also create an interference pattern indicating their wavelike nature however if you place detectors at the slits to observe which slit the particle passes through the interference pattern disappears and you get two distinct lines instead this suggests that the act of measurement collapses the wavelike behavior into particlelike behavior its a fundamental experiment highlighting the strange and fascinating nature of quantum mechanics","fafefifof","2024-12-13 05:07:25","4"

mass might not be real in the sense of being a fundamental unchanging property of matter it could actually just be an emergent phenomenon a macroscopic effect arising from underlying interactions and symmetries

sort of like temperature is a measure of average kinetic energy and not a fundamental entity mass could be a measure of energy interaction and not a fundamental property

our perception of mass might come from the way we experience its effects inertia gravity but not its underlying causes directly this is like how we perceive color based on the interaction of light with surfaces and our eyes rather than as a property intrinsic to the object

to get really speculative this could lead to understanding if we can possibly manipulate mass or leverage energy in beneficial ways","WilliamDefo","2024-12-13 08:37:29","1"

golf balls absorb the energy and travel resulting in a change of shape while in motion from point a to point b but go back to as close to their original shape when no longer in motion depending on the matter in motion a singular object probably absorbs the density of pressure gradient against it as long as the object does not break thus the object in motion accumulates mass as it travels 

does that mean there is ceiling on the amount of energy in the universe if this spitball theory holds any water 

as it was thought in other scientific articles 
black holes may develop from a release of energy
does released heat into the universe result in a transfer of mass

similarly in this study were dealing with a quasiparticle its not clear to me exactly what quasiparticle theyre talking about whats important is that this particular quasiparticle has a measurable mass quotations deliberate because im not clear on the details and in a very specific crystal lattice its mass and speed are different depending on the direction its traveling that could have some cool applications in computing that i couldnt even begin to imagine right now but its not like they discovered crazy particles that break physics or anything

myofunctional therapy basically focuses on exercises and potentially procedures like tongue tie release if necessary to improve tongue posture and thus correct your breathing and posture overall which will generally carry over into sleep

so depending on what is causing your issue to begin with i suppose this may or may not help but it is a holistic approach to correcting your movement and breathing patterns in general

pretty low commitment low risk and youll prob learn stuff along the way regardless you may be able to find a myofunctional therapist andor look for a sleep dentist  they focus on breathing first and foremost near you or you can find a lot of information online for specific exercises

for me it was a life changer i did have a tongue tie release which helped a lot but then being diligent with the exercises has really helped to fix so many aspects of my horrible posture and breathing tendencies

its all about the tongue baby","abgold88","2024-12-14 02:53:36","0"

but to answer your question i think its a bit different from fiber optics say for example i wanted to use a flashlight to send messages across the street from you one way i might do this is by turning the flashlight on and off in certain intervals to encode messages in morse code very basically the way signals are transmitted over fiber optic cables is the same idea as flashing a flashlight in a specific pattern the flashes just happen super fast and not in morse code the only thing the fiber optic cables themselves do is make it so that the light flashes can travel much greater distances without the message getting distorted and you can make the light source much smaller

what this discovery is is something else entirely im speculating here but any time theres something with 2 distinct states you can do binary encoding speculating even furtherthe article didnt say there were only 2 statesif the quasiparticle can travel in a diagonal maybe theres a superposition state and that makes me think quantum computingbut now im really stretching soyeah

anyway think of it like this fiber optics are for sending information from one place to another but you cant use fiber optics to create or store data to do that were still relying on semiconductor devices which are based on electrons","EmrysX77","2024-12-14 03:21:48","0"

1	modular flexibility
the retro encabulator introduces an enhanced modial interaction of magnetoreluctance compared to the turbo encabulators traditional reliance on quasiparticle delamination this supposedly allows for better integration with digital flange bracketry
2	polished sinusoidal reversion
unlike its predecessor the retro encabulator boasts a fully recalibrated cardinal grammeters eliminating the need for periodic recalibration of the ambifacient lunar waneshaft
3	energy efficiency
by incorporating hypercoherent panendermic semiboloids the retro encabulator achieves a 15 reduction in reactive spurving thrust past models struggled with power losses in the transverse grammeter coupling
4	backward compatibility
the retro encabulator is compatible with both legacy transencabulation protocols and newer quantum preflux interfacing systemsan upgrade over the turbo encabulators limited integration capabilities
5	user interface
a sleeker touchresponsive fluorescent sperving indicator replaces the turbo encabulators clunky side fumbling actuators providing enhanced user feedback during malleable synchronization of the grouting interstices","acctforspms","2024-12-14 18:37:10","4"

"m2g40u4","1hfk2a2","t3_1hfk2a2","simplified version for third graders

scientists study tiny particles called spins which can create special states of matter called quantum spin liquids these liquids are different because their spins dont line up or settle into patterns even when it gets very cold one example of this is called quantum spin ice where the particles act in surprising ways some behave like light and others act like parts of matter with tiny pieces of charge

its hard to find real examples of quantum spin liquids and prove how they work in experiments in this study scientists looked at a material called cesno which might be a quantum spin ice they tested its magnetism over time and found some very interesting results

the material showed patterns or peaks that match theories about how tiny particle pairs form and move these patterns were seen using special tools like neutron spectroscopy which let scientists look closely at whats happening the results showed strong signs that the material has something called a flux phase which is a key feature of quantum spin ice this provides evidence that in this material particles can break into smaller parts in a special state of matter called a threedimensional quantum spin liquid","Phyting","2024-12-17 04:30:06","4"

"m2nam7q","1hh0628","t3_1hh0628","from the article since the birth of the worlds first test tube baby in 1978 in vitro fertilization ivf has helped millions of people worldwide overcome fertility issues and become parents but while the procedure is designed to deliver a bundle  or bundles  of joy into the world its not without some downsides

a new fertility technique developed by gameto a femaleled biotech company dedicated to advancing womens reproductive health provides an alternative to traditional ivf and the company says it has fewer drawbacks whats more the first live human baby conceived by the technique  which is called fertilo  was recently born

we are delighted to celebrate the worlds first live birth conceived using fertilo said dr dina radenkovic gametos ceo and cofounder by overcoming the major challenges of conventional ivf such as long treatment cycles significant side effects and the emotional and physical strain fertilo provides a potentially faster safer and more accessible solution for families this milestone marks a turning point in reproductive health and highlights the first application of ipsc induced pluripotent stem cell technology in ivf and the immense potential of our technology

in conventional ivf mature eggs are collected from ovaries and fertilized by sperm in a laboratory after spending around five days in a protected lab environment the fertilized egg embryo is transferred into the uterus in hopes that pregnancy will occur but thats really the end part of the process prior to egg collection the ovaries are stimulated to produce more eggs than usual through the administration of one or two hormone injections a day sometimes up to 90 shots per treatment cycle a full cycle of ivf takes about twotothree weeks

there are some downsides to ivf as with most things in life there are no guarantees ivf does not guarantee a baby theres a risk of multiple pregnancies which carries its own risks additionally the required hormone injections can cause ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome where the ovaries become swollen and painful theres the physical and emotional stress that couples go through thats associated with regular checkups injections and the constant question am i pregnant then of course theres the cost

in the us its estimated that the average base cost of one ivf cycle falls somewhere between us14000 and 20000 in australia the publicly funded health insurance scheme medicare covers part of the cost per calendar year making the outofpocket cost for one cycle a little over us3800 aud6000 a subsequent cycle in the same calendar year carries an outofpocket cost of around aud5300","chrisdh79","2024-12-18 12:07:52","4"

"m2ne9re","1hh0628","t1_m2nam7q","the fertilo procedure differs from traditional ivf because it takes ovarian support cells oscs derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells ipscs and cocultures them with an immature egg to mimic the natural egg maturation process in the lab a 2023 study showed that this method significantly improved egg maturation and embryo formation gameto says the fertilo procedure avoids 80 of the hormone injections that traditional ivf requires and reduces the duration of a treatment cycle to three days

the ability to mature eggs outside the body within minimal hormonal intervention signficiantly reduces risks such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and alleviates the side effects caused by high hormone doses said dr luis guzmn the lead at pranor laboratories peru who oversaw the fertilo procedure that resulted in the first live birth fertilo is a major advancement for women who cannot tolerate or do not want to undergo the burden of the traditional ivf protocol bringing hope and new possibilities to a broader patient population

the mother of the worlds first fertilo baby born in the santa isabel clinic in lima peru couldnt be happier

the fertilo method was the preferred option compared to traditional approaches she said with fewer injections and a gentler less invasive egg retrieval process it gave me hope and reassurance during a deeply personal journey fertilos innovative approach made the physical experience easier and also lightened the emotional burden of many hormone injections i am profoundly grateful to the pranor clinic and the gameto team for their care and dedication in making my dream of having a family a reality

only last week gameto announced that it had partnered with the australiabased ivf clinic chain ivfaustralia ivfa making the fertilo approach available to patients at select clinics throughout the country that means that gameto has regulatory clearance for fertilo in australia japan argentina paraguay mexico and peru the us may be next with the company preparing for phase 3 trials there","gweedle","2024-12-18 12:38:08","4"

"m30ho2r","1hiicdb","t1_m2z3y1l","by the way yes its quite a funny story around 2015 two guys greg dobos and tamas tompa were sitting in an art caf after a nuclear energy vr conference and thats where the idea came up d nine years later three research groups have already published articles on the topic northwestern cornell and a hungarian group

i remember back in the early days when we ordered displays and lenses from aliexpress with our own money as students we brainstormed in the microscope room in the evenings over beers dreaming about the future and hoping that one day this would become a usable device d i told this funny story to the washington post interview last year but they skipped it  

by the way mice vr isnt fundamentally new david tank and dan dombeck at northwestern where im also working published a monitorbased version between 2007 and 2011 which the entire neuroscience community still uses what makes this different is that it can project a stereo image which is important because mice cant focus with their eyes

instead they use their stereoscopic vision to estimate distances for example when jumping over a ditch escaping from eagles or owls or hunting crickets you cant achieve this with a monitor","No_Impression_6519","2024-12-20 17:53:03","1"
"m30irzj","1hiicdb","t1_m2zdn2d","not only is cancer the only problem faced by modern urban people many suffer from anxiety ptsd panic attacks and other neurological disordersnot to mention alzheimers and parkinsons diseases

these vr devices help researchers understand these neurological mechanisms through brain microscopy or electrodes because the animal is headfixed allowing brain imaging with a roomsized microscope while performing tasks in vr

as mentioned earlier mouse vr technology dates back to around 20072011 from the tank and dombeck labs since then hundreds or even thousands of papers have been published on the subject and its use extends beyond basic research for example it can be used to test medications under controlled conditions

one example we tested the effect of an antidepressant in vr and the animal didnt hide in the dark tunnel but happily ran around meanwhile we could map the brain mechanisms how does the drug work to this day we still dont fully understand how some antidepressants function at the synaptic level yet millions take them

this approach enables the development of bettertargeted drugs with fewer side effects","No_Impression_6519","2024-12-20 17:59:07","1"

"m30kknl","1hiicdb","t1_m2zwrgp","as i mentioned above it started in 200711 where tank and dombeck built a monitor based vr for mice and performed the first headfixed behavior experiments with 2p microscope

of coures its far away from the freely moving because there is no head tilt or rotation but they can adapt to it quickly there is no experiment in the world that is not influenced in some way by the equipment or experimental apparatus itself these are models that approximate reality despite this they are highly usefulsince 2007 hundreds or even thousands of papers have been published using these tools currently this is the only way to perform synapticlevel imaging of the mouse brain with a roomsized microscope since the mouse is headfixed

my current research focuses precisely on comparing the effects of vr to freely moving conditions this is possible using electrodes implanted in the brain allowing us to read place fields from the hippocampusour brains navigation map in vr the same place fields form and based only on neuronal firing patterns we can perform mind reading accurately determining where the mouse is in the maze there are optogenetic tools which you can implant or erase memories itl be quite useful for treating ptsd in the future selecting the coding cells

think of this like a human lying in a fixed position inside a noisy fmri scanner while solving tasksexcept this is millions of times more immersive we are already working with unity 3d the same platform used to create assassins creed so compared to a human fmri study its much more roboust d and replicatable","No_Impression_6519","2024-12-20 18:09:08","4"

"m37r5vs","1hjkbj3","t1_m37gbab","antimatter is matter with the opposite charge to normal matter  atoms are held together by the force of the negatively charged electrons orbiting the nucleus being attracted to the positively charged protons inside its nucleus  when you think about it there isnt really a reason why electrons have to be negatively charged other than because the protons are positively charged   so we can pretty easily imagine an antiatom where instead of protons with positive charge and electrons with negative we have antiprotons that are negatively charged and antielectrons called positrons that are positively charged  

the reason its more interesting than just a thought exercise is because 1 when matter comes into contact with antimatter they completely annihilate and all the energy contained in them is released as photons so in theory an antimattermatter reactor would be perfectly efficient and 2 we actually do see and can make antimatter although storing it is really hard since if it touches the jar you want to put it in it turns into light so theres a standing question of why are we surrounded by matter when antimatter seems just as good

the people saying theres no application are wrong  you may have heard of a pet scan  that stands for positron emmission tomography  you get an injection of some stuff that lets off radiation in the form of positrons and when these positrons interact with the electrons you already have in your body they release a very specific light that the machine can see  this way doctors can look at the way your body is metabolizing the stuff they injected you with if you have tumors they literally light up because of the antimatter","Pakyul","2024-12-22 00:23:52","1"

"m37t63k","1hjkbj3","t1_m37gbab","during the big bang there were almost identical amounts of matter and antimatter produced the vast majority of both annihilated each other they were produced because the big bang was a high energy environment in the form of radiation this radiation obeyed the conservation of energy principles and when conditions were correct it would produce a matter antimatter pair

in theory there shouldve been an equal amount of matter and antimatter produced when they annihilated each other there shouldnt have been any left but somehow there was more matter and thats why we have a matter dominant universe instead of nothing 

antimatter is considered the opposite of matter in a few quantum properties like charge and baryon number 

positrons have the same mass as electrons but its a positive charge instead of negative 

in regular matter nucleus is made of protons and neutrons but in antimatter the antiprotons have a negative charge while the antineutrons have no charge like neutrons they have a baryon number of 1 instead of 1 like neutrons these also annihilate each other","Ancient-Island-2495","2024-12-22 00:37:16","1"

"m37umjn","1hjkbj3","t1_m37gbab","emc2 the equation einstein is best known for says that all matter is made up of energy 

you and everything around you is energy 

to figure out just how much energy makes up an object you take an objects mass in kilograms and multiply it by the speed of light squared

so i weigh 160lbs to get that in kg you divide it by 2205 so i weigh 160  2205  726 kg

take the mass and multiply that by the speed of light constant squared

so the speed of light  299792458 ms 
speed of light squared  89875517873681764 ms


so the equation for the amount of energy in my body is 726  89875517873681764 652510 

or 65249625976292960664 joules of energy

for reference the atomic bomb dropped on hiroshima was equal to 60000000000000 joules of energy

now antimatter is the opposite form of matter so there are opposites of hydrogen carbon oxygen etc so on and so on

when antimatter and matter meet they completely annihilate one another this releases all of the mass energy so if i was to interact with all the antimatter particles that make up my body id release 65249625976292960664 joules of energy

this is equal to 100000 hiroshima atomic bombs


we could theoretically utilize antimatter to destroy matter and harness massive amounts of energy from nearly anything 

im not a physicist though so anybody more knowledgeable should correct me or add more nuance

edit am on mobile apologize if all the newline formatting is terrible on web

edit edit changed yield of hiroshima bomb from 18  60 

also realized i forgot to account for the energy released from the antimatter annihilation

so the accurate way to calculate for a matter antimatter annihilation energy conversion is actually e2mc2 so just double the weight of the object in kg before plugging it into emc2 for the total joule output of both the matter and antimatter","Humble-Difference287","2024-12-22 00:47:14","1"

for a long time i been thinking dark matter is on the opposite side of space time for example there is two sides to paper and fabrics

dark matter being a sun

antimatter is then another time or timeline because of folding and this isnt where the sun is that makes up some 85 percent of the universes mass and is dark matter because its not on this side of space time 

yet we can make antimatter through collisions and if we was on the flip side of space time and be antimatter ourselves we could make matter through collisions the same way we do in our universe of matter but this is something i only think about

also imagine you could be going forward in time yet closer to the beginning because of the folding so if it was possible to flip over to another time you could go back to an earlier time but be an old man from a point of reference so if you draw an arrow and rolled this up on a fabric and marked time going in one direction you will realize as you go forward in time this is backwards to yourself because this is wrapped up and folded

dark matter is a sun on the opposite side of space time and space time may only be an equilibrium or seemingly for now

antimatter could be us in another time and timeline and we are all squeezed together and into each other having to do with the folding

and every point in time and space is right here right now","thebudman_420","2024-12-22 09:35:41","1"

also anyone that has made concrete will know that the performance of a mix is complex and the guide for a mix is astm or similar standards controlled by a government agency this will take years to create a construction standard scale up production and create recycling programs and incentives to do so it will take even longer for engineers and contractors to use and spec this product without reason which means it needs to be cheaper and or easier for the contractor 

all that to say this is really great news but it isnt the fixyet","MischiefManaged777","2024-12-22 16:32:55","2"

also doesnt add major costs is usually code for adds costs ie is more expensive if it werent more expensive youd just say its cheaper right there would be no need to waffle about it

"m3dga19","1hjzcjn","t1_m3cq4rx","i went and read the article and it seems like the summary was just like wrong  the article itself is about a specific turtle whos buoyancy is actually not due to an air bubble but due to a spinal injury which causes his intestines to malfunction in a way that leads to gas buildup in the intestines which is why they made a harness for this specific turtle  

additionally though the bubble syndrome usually happens due to an impact hard enough to cause the shell to deform pretty seriously basically warping such that it has a lump where air accumulates so its not a temporary air bubble like the original comment sort of implies but a deformity thatd accumulate air even if you drained it once   

as a final note weighted harnesses put together more ad hoc with water resistant glue are used in treatment right now so the real innovation in this article is 3d printing a custom harness rather than the mere fact of the harness itself that said harnesses come off so turtles with this syndrome are generally considered unreleasable bc they need regular treatment to survive

its primary purpose seems to be allowing lasers to fire around obstructions like terrain without having to bring the weapon itself into line of sight with the enemy this makes sense considering the actual ground based machine that produces the laser would be easy pickings especially as it is likely to be relatively heavy and large making it hard to transport conceal and protect especially if you have to take the risk of letting your enemy have line of sight on the weapon system before you can fire it this eliminates that problem so long as the redirected beam from the beam still has enough energy to damage the target","nikolai_470000","2024-12-23 03:09:45","1"

if you write 2 letters  one that says a and another that says b then put them in unmarked envelopes then send one elsewhere then open one you instantly know what the other letter says

you cannot write on an opened letter and expect the other letter to react the act of opening the envelope causes the paper to start rotting as far as this metaphor is concerned

in quantum mechanics its still impressive non entangled particles wont stay in a certain state the way entangled particles will

the breakthrough here is we can send envelopes entangled photons through fiber optic cables instead of specialized containers","piratecheese13","2024-12-23 15:16:03","1"

a and c are entangled at the start of this process there is no analogue for this in the post office

a and b are entangled now this destroys the entanglement between a and c  

the resulting state of a and b are measured this destroys the entangled state and gives a measurement result of two bits of information

the two bits are transferred to location 2 via classical means and used as the input variables to apply an operation to particle c

the resulting state of particle c is identical to the state that a and b had been in

it seems trivial but it was long considered impossible to exactly duplicate a quantum state the only reason it can happen is that the original state was destroyed in the process  its like built in drm that prevents ever duplicating a quantum state

the measurement of the state of a and b is to find their state in relation to c once the second entanglement is collapsed then entanglement is no longer part of the process

the process applied at c duplicates the state that a and b shared  there are fundamental difficulties in transferring and error correcting quantum data

because a and c were initially entangled then they will be fundamentally opposite in some effect when decoupled im not sure exactly which metric therefore the measurement of the state of a and b also has the information on its relationship to c which allows for the state of a and b to be duplicated at c

i take the first piece cut the tattered edge and connect it to another piece of paper seamlessly

i then rip those two pieces apart and cut the tattered edges off and mail them to my friend

using the tattered edges i sent plus the tattered edge they still have they are able to connect new pieces of paper to the one they have in the exact same configuration that the second paper had

unmanned autonomous vehicles will allow us to go much deeper as we already have the material science to build military drones that are capable of going pretty much anywhere they want and they make it possible for us to spy on our enemies remotely before they ever get close enough to detect our manned subs both of these things are much easier to achieve and can work right now with existing tech  so long as it is an unmanned craft that is capable of independent operation 

this is a dumb article searching for a problem that has already been solved and wasnt even bound to be a threat to us yet not any time soon the biggest concern with sensors that beat the stealth capabilities of our subs is drones to actually care and deploy those capabilities very much like the ones we are already developing since we are likely to be the first ones to make significant use of that tech in the near future its not really a big deal like the title is framing it as","nikolai_470000","2024-12-25 00:16:00","0"

this is also due to the complex engineering matter of actually operating them remotely controlling it at great depths and range would be impossible for rovs that operate wirelessly for control you basically need to have a ship right above it on the surface to stay close enough to get a signal through all that water thats another benefit to having an automated system that can carry out tasks on its own 

the idea is that you can preprogram them with different instructions for mission and let software algorithms and other forms of ai automatically carry out tasks without needing to be connected or directly managed they also have the ability to recharge themselves so their endurance is effectively unlimited if they work as intended the only limit to their operation is what instructions you can give them 

release it shore off the pacific with instructions to sail to the south china sea and go sit on the sea bed once its there it will just listen and gather data quietly at a predetermined time it will head out into the middle of the ocean drop a comm buoy and either head back to gather more intel or to its next mission or it can just head home or meet up for retrieval by another vessel

while the bit stayed flipped for a short amount of time flipping it at all in this state in a predictable and controllable way was a major step toward making new kinds of devices that could be more secure and only change bits when you want through light good tech but just in its infant stages yet to see if they can apply this to different systems that dont need to be so cold good start","bacon-squared","2024-12-25 15:38:39","1"

apparently you need to know the states of both particles to get any information out of entanglement and those particles must be read for the first time since being entangled if you just got the state of 100 entangled particles youd have no idea which ones were already collapsed without knowing the states of the other 100 particles apparently still not too clear what on earth is a hilbert space","RGBedreenlue","2024-12-25 17:42:13","2"

 125 years later castrol remains at the forefront of innovation applying its extensive expertise in fluid engineering to address modern challenges

 one of its key focus areas is the development of advanced dielectric fluids for immersion cooling systems this approach sees entire servers submerged in nonconductive fluids that absorb and transfer heat away from the components eliminating the need for traditional fans

 the castrol on liquid cooling centre of excellence in pangbourne uk serves as a stateoftheart research and development hub for liquid cooling technologies

 the facility develops customized solutions and rigorously tests fluid dynamics material compatibility and server performance to address the challenges of traditional cooling methods

 in a recent visit storagereview had the opportunity to see castrols cuttingedge immersion tanks from providers like grc and submer and was impressed by the adaptability and efficiency of the solutions

 writer jordan ranous noted in one of the test cells we observed grcs tank which had a striking green glow due to the specific fluid castrol was using the servers submerged in this tank were undergoing compatibility and performance testing castrol ensures that every component from cpus to cables can operate effectively in immersion cooling environments without degradation

 castrols on range of singlephase dielectric fluids including dc15 and dc20 aims to deliver advanced thermal management durability and safety while maintaining efficient performance at operating temperatures between 40c and 50c with some systems capable of handling up to 70c

 chris lockett vp of electrification and castrol product innovation at bp castrols parent company told storagereview at the moment about 40 of power consumption in data centers goes toward cooling immersion cooling can drop that figure to less than 5 significantly lowering power and water usage

 data centers account for an estimated 23 of global power consumption with current liquid cooling efforts primarily focused on directtochip solutions immersion cooling has the potential to establish a new standard for thermal management and castrol wants to lead this transformation positioning itself as a onestop partner for the liquid cooling solutions of today and tomorrow","ControlCAD","2024-12-26 01:08:29","4"

2 it takes a while for new treatments to go through all the clinical trials approval processes etc especially when the agencies or rather the politicians who hold power in those agencies arent exactly incentivized to speedrun them thats just a sweeping generalization though and doesnt happen every time its also not to say that theyre disincentivized

private healthcare hospitals and insurance are popular in these countries for this reason

so factoring in that you have to pay exorbitant ammounts of taxes healthcare efficiency is subpar and you also get to pay for private healthcare to get the treatment you want you might find out that us healthcare is not that bad

what if someone makes a biological weapon and because we shut off sectors of study for moral reasons that weapon tears through a nation because we dont understand it letting our own ignorance be our end

we do these things to help people ideally the original insulin patent was sold for 1 capitalism is what made it unaffordable in the us

even weapons of war have their purpose if you do not build weapons and cannot defend yourself and then a nation invades your lands and destroys your people are you truly morally just because you didnt fight back everyone is dead but at least we didnt throw a punch

there is always a cost and the best that we can do is understand those costs and try and reduce the evilness of it as much as we can while also realizing that a perfectly ideal world is unachievable without more study of the world and technology that allows us to no longer need to cut open animals or whatever evils we must commit in the name of progress and protecting others 

though none of this accounts for capitalism which of course is the real root of all evil kinda thing im just looking through a pure pragmatic and scientific lens in this comment","IntendedMishap","2024-12-28 01:14:02","0"

i will come back with a statistic that points to the 4x times the cost claim i worked some time ago on a very detailed analysis on healthcare costs in europe 
what that study sughested was that when taking in all the costs of living in those countries the healthcare budgets the overhead of the whole system the costs were much higher than what the average american pays in their lifetime

total expenditure is the point thats how much you spend out of pocket plus what the government takes in taxes all other developed nations have costs that are 50 lower typically do not come directly out of pocket which directly impacts lower income citizens or those whove lost jobs and have a better overall quality of care than the ushttpsworldpopulationreviewcomcountryrankingsbesthealthcareintheworld

id still tend to agree that heat is going to be a fundamental limiter  there will be issues with how thick you can make these before using external cooling will still leave the centermost crystals getting too hot but at very least it should make 3d chips more workable i think its a step toward better designs for sure though maybe not revolutionary alone","KitsuneLeo","2024-12-28 21:50:16","1"

in addition when the above is considered what do all the extra transistors buy any user  there has been little more than increasing the number of different parallel functional units and number of storage arrays which all load the power rails and increase heat and lower productive duty cycle  and lets not even start to talk about clocking    good call xrave","jjseven","2024-12-29 04:07:09","1"

"m4bfjol","1hod1vv","t1_m496w0n","transistors are like gatekeepers for electricity   give them enough juice they let electrons through these electrons sometimes due to quantum behavior just say nuhuh and phase through things quantum tunneling which in single layer chips like weve largely seen thus far means they just skip the transistors gatewhen it isnt bigger than the quantum tunnelings max range but in 3d designs like proposed here chip makers should pay extra attention to possible quantum tunneling that could happen between layers of chip silicon

transistors also like all electronic components generate heat because nothing is 100 efficient at the scale transistors are made this heat is negligible except for the fact that there are billions of them within a single cpu sized chip with single layer silicon you can just throw a cooler on top of the whole thing and call it a day but once you stack layers the lower layers are further away from the cooling and have other heatgenerating layers sitting on top of them so for 3d chip designs adequately cooling through the layers is going to be a unique and difficult challenge

hope this helps","Crispy511","2024-12-29 06:13:01","1"

and imagine if they replicated us infinitely grew extra arms legs and ears on our clones molested them mutilated them and dissected them just to live longer more painfree lives themselves youre fine with it

also people like you just dont seem to understand the cost of things exploiting animals isnt sustainable animal agriculture is one of the leading contributors to climate change and environmental pollution not to mention a breeding ground for zoonotic diseases and a lot of the illnesses humans rely on animal experimentation to treat are ones humans gave themselves to begin with

its sad and really pathetic that people can defend animal exploitation so assuredly because it means they still havent learned to think things through the fact that you cant see the moral issue with giving humans carte blanche to exploit any other organism they find is bad enough but not being able to see the harm it causes your own species is an embarrassment","Unknown","2024-12-29 21:00:31","0"

"m4ixpnx","1hpnhv8","t3_1hpnhv8","i had read other articles about these drugs and maybe someone could correct me if im wrong but it doesnt extend the lifespan but instead it extends the healthy lifespan in dogs where the metabolic breakdown appears to happen very fast such as larger dogs with shorter lifespan meanwhile the 17 year old chihuahua might result in an extra year of good young health but their ages are generally cut short for nonageing related illnesses and injuries like cancer and organ failure 

its great news either way as long as it stays inexpensive more time with our best friends is more time i have been following these drugs since the passing of my 17 year old littledude and id loved for him to live an extra 12 years but when i looked into the drugs their main success is in dogs with lifespans of 712 years like great danes greyhounds huskies etc

it promises to be like a multivitamin of effectiveness to promote the balance of metabolism in dogs that need the balance its still wrapped up in breed and genetics for determining successful outcomes

but as a dog lover even an extra couple of healthier and stronger months would have been worth it i just dont see the broader claims or human hopes and that slowing ageing related symptoms isnt necessarily expanding a lifespan and i dont think they should be throwing around longevity as a buzzword","Tomato_Sky","2024-12-30 14:23:30","0"

the diminishing returns with dogs with longer lifespans is a big caveat that shows its not extending life and instead balances a problem with aging where the metabolic rates become irregular and larger dogs arent getting the proper nutrition still a great problem to solve and has promises in human health but nobody should be reading these headlines and wishing they could have given this to their late best friends or their current ailing best friends love them all you can with the time they have","Tomato_Sky","2024-12-30 18:34:46","2"

physicists have recently measured the shape of electrons in solid materials a concept known as quantum geometry for the first time this achievement enhances our understanding of the fundamental properties of materials and could lead to advancements in quantum technologies

what is quantum geometry

in quantum physics electrons can behave both like particles and waves the wave aspect is described by a mathematical function that has a specific shape or geometry understanding this shape is crucial because it influences how electrons move and interact within materials affecting the materials overall properties

the breakthrough

previously scientists could only theorize about the quantum geometry of electrons in solid materials now researchers from the massachusetts institute of technology mit have developed a method to measure this directly they used a technique called angleresolved photoemission spectroscopy arpes which involves shining light on a material to eject electrons and then analyzing these electrons to gain insights into their properties 

why it matters

this direct measurement of quantum geometry opens new possibilities for understanding and manipulating the quantum properties of materials it could lead to the development of advanced electronic and magnetic devices as well as improvements in quantum computers the method can be applied to various quantum materials not just the ones studied in this research 

conclusion

i also think that we can make our own planet a priority while still sending scientists to mars our civilization can have many projects going on at once and more resources can be allocated to the most pressing issues nasas budget is less than 25 billion which is small compared to what we spend on healthcare or housing for example cutting that budget to zero would not put a dent in our big problems","pm_me_ur_ephemerides","2025-01-02 00:36:48","0"

this article seems to conflate hallucinations with brain storming

hallucinations  representing something as a fact when its not

brain storming  coming up with a bunch of ideas that may or may not have a factual basis

ai brain storming is awesome because you know before starting that many of the responses will be meaningless

ai hallucinations are very bad because you go into it thinking all responses are fact based

finding out your ai spouted out some bullshit after the fact and saying uhhh but but we learned other stuff after we figured out the ai was full of shit in its original response is not something that should be lauded","Independent_Tie_4984","2025-01-02 03:36:17","0"

ai algorithms give outputs that plausibly fit in the dataset they dont distinguish between correct and incorrect answers they only distinguish between plausible and implausible answers when alphafold predicts protein folding it is sometimes wrong but its outputs are always plausible same with language models  they will tell you things that arent true but they will do so in a way that sounds true

it turns out generating plausible outputs is an extraordinarily useful thing to do in some fields like protein folding its way easier to verify and correct wrong answers than it is to manually find right ones","FaultElectrical4075","2025-01-02 04:47:34","0"

if you think youre getting an accurate response to a question and believe it to be true because ai made it sound correct when its merely plausible  thats hallucination

its a user education issue for the most part and the rapid expansion results in a huge number of users that dont and perhaps cant understand that every ai response is a weighted probability","Independent_Tie_4984","2025-01-02 05:20:10","0"

"m504om0","1hrtc3n","t3_1hrtc3n","from the articlehttpswwwcamacukresearchnewssystemtoautodetectnewvariantswillinformbetterresponsetofutureinfectiousdisease the new approach uses samples from infected humans to allow realtime monitoring of pathogens circulating in human populations and enable vaccineevading bugs to be quickly and automatically identified this could inform the development of vaccines that are more effective in preventing disease

the approach can also quickly detect emerging variants with resistance to antibiotics this could inform the choice of treatment for people who become infected  and try to limit the spread of the disease

it uses genetic sequencing data to provide information on the genetic changes underlying the emergence of new variants this is important to help understand why different variants spread differently in human populations

there are very few systems in place to keep watch for emerging variants of infectious diseases apart from the established covid and influenza surveillance programmes the technique is a major advance on the existing approach to these diseases which has relied on groups of experts to decide when a circulating bacteria or virus has changed enough to be designated a new variant

by creating family trees the new approach identifies new variants automatically based on how much a pathogen has changed genetically and how easily it spreads in the human population  removing the need to convene experts to do this 

it can be used for a broad range of viruses and bacteria and only a small number of samples taken from infected people are needed to reveal the variants circulating in a population this makes it particularly valuable for resourcepoor settings

another problem is instrumentation quality instrumentation is hand made by a dying breed of foreign artisans their thoroughput is not nearly high enough to meet replenishment demand let alone expansion demand not to mention sterile processing departments tend to be painfully undersized and understaffed for the volume of surgery of the hospital they serve

"m56uyw5","1hsobi1","t3_1hsobi1","from the articlehttpsinterestingengineeringcominnovationgoldfromewastetotransformco2 a novel method developed by a cornellled research team offers a dual solution to two pressing environmental problems ewaste recycling and carbon dioxide co2 reduction

the teams innovation recovers gold from discarded electronics and uses it as a catalyst to transform co2 a greenhouse gas into useful organic materials

with approximately 50 million tons of electronic waste generated annuallyand only 20 of it recycledthis approach could help alleviate the environmental burden according to amin zadehnazari lead researcher and postdoctoral scientist in the lab of professor alireza abbaspourrad at cornell university

electronics waste is a surprisingly rich source of gold containing at least 10 times more of the metal per ton than natural gold ore with global ewaste projected to reach 80 million metric tons by 2030 efficient recovery methods are increasingly crucial

zadehnazari synthesized two innovative vinyllinked covalent organic frameworks vcofs materials designed to extract gold ions and nanoparticles from discarded circuit boards among these one vcof demonstrated exceptional selectivity capturing 999 of the gold while avoiding other metals like nickel and copper

we can use the goldloaded cofs to convert co2 into useful chemicals zadehnazari said by transforming co2 into valueadded materials we not only reduce waste disposal demands we also provide both environmental and practical benefits its kind of a winwin for the environment

traditional techniques for gold recovery often rely on hazardous chemicals like cyanide posing significant environmental risks in contrast zadehnazaris method employs chemical adsorption a safer and more ecofriendly process

covalent organic frameworks known for their porous crystalline structure offer versatility in applications ranging from energy storage to chemical sensing using tetrathiafulvalene ttf as a building block zadehnazari created a ttfcof that excelled in gold adsorption due to its sulfurrich composition which gold naturally binds to

the material demonstrated impressive durability maintaining efficiency over 16 cycles of washing and reuse","chrisdh79","2025-01-03 15:00:51","4"

a vegan can eat as much of those as they want so long as they dont also have animal products my husband and i are about 5050 junk food and whole foods plantbased neither of us has had a cavity in decades you can eat bad stuff for teeth so long as your oral hygiene is good","Cyphinate","2025-01-04 21:34:56","0"

it was kind of a wake up call yknow aside from my liver cheers i am pretty considerate of my wholistic health until it comes to my teeth i barely even notice they are there thats bad and it has taken me almost 30 years to wise up 

yknow people fantasize about having a magic genie or a time machine if i could go back just 10 years i would have just taken better care of my teeth 

theres this old book that talks about how a quarter of mankinds suffering is toothache and ive heard of people committing suicide from toothaches nobody ever killed themselves over a broken arm lol","Unknown","2025-01-04 21:45:21","0"

argonatmosphere environment and dried under vacuum at 80 c for
14 h the cells were filled with electrolyte in an argonatmosphere
environment then vacuumsealed at a gauge pressure of 90 kpa and
a temperature of 165 c using a compact vacuum sealer msk115a
mti corp the electrolyte used was 12 m lipf6 in a 37 mixture by
weight of ethylene carbonate ec basf 9995 20 ppm water
and ethyl methyl carbonate emc basf 999 20 ppm water
respectively a vc211 ternary electrolyte additive blend was used
which consists of 2 wt vc basf 995 100 ppm water 1 wt
ttspi tokyo chemical industry co ltd 950 and 1 wt
mmds guangzhou tinci co ltd 9870 after filling the pouch
cells were held at a constant voltage of 15 v for 24 h to ensure
adequate wetting of the electrodes subsequently the cells were
charged from 15 v to 41 v at c20 and discharged to 38 v at
40 c in a single formation cycle the gas volume generated during
formation was measured ex situ for all cells lastly the cells were
brought into an arfilled glovebox cut open to remove any gases
generated during formation and resealed under vacuum


this study very specifically used commercially manufactured pouch cells containing polycrystalline nmc62 so theoretically commercial viability is much better then other methods that involve basically building from scratch entire production assemblies but from the above its still a genuine pain the ass to assemble but i cant tell if its because this specifically is a difficult method or because lithium ev battery production is difficult in general","deathtokiller","2025-01-06 04:28:25","4"

i would recommend using a llm to summarize it 

conclusion below

conclusions

an overarching theme of this work is that heavily cycled
commercial cells can show remarkable spatial heterogeneity and
complex kinetic behavior even within a single cell labbased xrd
measurements of such cells will be spatially averaged while single
point synchrotron measurements will only sample a small portion of
the cell and could lead to nonrepresentative or even misleading
results to properly characterize degradation this extensive in
commercial cells spatially resolved experiments are needed to fully
capture and isolate different behaviors in different regions of the
cell the combination of both spatially and temporally resolved
experiments is a powerful tool for understanding nonequilibrium
behavior this is an application to which synchrotron xrd is
uniquely suited
modelling the complex multifaceted behavior of extensively
degraded cells is challenging assumptions cannot be easily made
about the number of components present their kinetic behavior or
their spatial distribution in the cell models that require such
assumptions can work well for cells that have been cycled less
extensively or under less abusive conditions but heavily degraded
cells like the one studied here do not easily lend themselves to this
approach conducting a variety of both nearequilibrium and non
equilibrium experiments provides complementary information that is
useful for validating assumptions and constructing appropriate
models
in this study we included representative data on a heavily cycled
cell with a singlecrystal positive electrode to illustrate that the
inactive fractions of the positive electrode can be extremely small
even after 20000 cycles readers must realize that the choice of
electrode materials and electrode formulations plays a dominant role
in determining possible active mass loss during extended charge
discharge cycling
despite the complexity and challenge of characterizing such
cells this type of work will become increasingly relevant as more
evs reach end of life and the supply of potential secondlife battery
packs grows over time this work is meant to provide an apprecia
tion for the complex behavior of heavily degraded cells which
require a cautious and nuanced approach to characterization and
modelling we hope the experimental protocols data reduction
techniques and modelling approaches discussed here will be of use
to other researchers trying to characterize the emergent properties of
extensively degraded cells as cycleintensive applications like
secondlife ess and v2g storage are implemented a comprehensive
understanding of these cells is becoming increasingly important","deathtokiller","2025-01-06 04:29:44","4"

it isnt like the top or the side of your skull or even near the occipital bone in your skull its on the underside of your brain its not in your grey matter its in the midbrain which is part of your brainstem the part of your body responsible for breathing heart rate and other essential operations for keeping the body alive outside of our conscious control 

i understand if there are implants on different parts of the grey matter but i hadnt heard of implants in the midbrain before

in rereading my original response i think i might not have been clear when i said does this go anywhere in the brain i didnt mean does this go in the brain or not i meant can this go in the brain in any location or does this injection go directly into the substantia nigra","Eelwithzeal","2025-01-06 23:21:38","1"

it wasnt a total cure as he still has some shaking and has trouble doing certain things but its far more controllable for him 

now with his data and results  the doctors decided they will put 2 million cells into the next patient to see if they can get even better results

 the emergence of insecticide resistance has increased the need for alternative pest management tools numerous genetic biocontrol approaches which involve the release of genetically modified organisms to control pest populations are in various stages of development to provide highly targeted pest control however all current matingbased genetic biocontrol technologies function by releasing engineered males which skew sexratios or reduce offspring viability in subsequent generations which leaves mated females to continue to cause harm eg transmit disease here we demonstrate intragenerational genetic biocontrol wherein mating with engineered males reduces female lifespan the toxic male technique tmt involves the heterologous expression of insecticidal proteins within the male reproductive tract that are transferred to females via mating in this study we demonstrate tmt in drosophila melanogaster males which reduce the median lifespan of mated females by 37  64 compared to controls mated to wild type males agentbased models of aedes aegypti predict that tmt could reduce rates of blood feeding by a further 40  60 during release periods compared to leading biocontrol technologies like fsridl tmt is a promising approach for combatting outbreaks of disease vectors and agricultural pests","Mr_Vulcanator","2025-01-09 16:28:55","4"

there was a recent science article i had read where it had unintended excisions from a larger genome when people say crispr theyre meaning a complex which can excise sequences of dna and it comes from bacteria in bacteria its viral dna it excises but weve been able to engineer it to target sequences we want bacterias dna compared to ours is much shorter in length so it wouldnt be likely that crispr would run into two similar genomic sequences in larger genomes like ours or plants there is a much higher likelihood of it running into a similar sequence its an unintended consequence of taking a complex that has evolved for bacterial genomes and trying to use it for larger genomes it is still incredibly promising and i cant wait to see where research takes it

i guess this article is talking about the other way where they induce a general increase in local body temp to increase blood flow to the affected area the article fails to mention that this only works to fight cancer if its paired with traditional treatment methods like chemotherapy since the increased blood flow should increase the metabolism of the affected cells and thus the speed at which they process the drugs

in addition if you go in for recovery this could be a really good way to survive a relapsewhich is when most people od so its not super ridiculous to assume someone in recovery would be under medical care  not to mention if youre oding you need another person to use the narcan on you so thats not useful

youre also not clocking that this would be useful for many people with complex problems where they have a cocktail of meds that could potentially lead to oding on the opioids theyre also prescribed

not to mention the potential other uses for this technology where the detection of the problem situation is harder like anaphylaxis

not really sure why wed draw a line to prevent us from saving peoples lives  unless for some reason you dont think strangers deserve to live based purely on the fact that they might be taking drugs regardless of their circumstances","Scrapple_Joe","2025-01-14 19:56:07","0"

"m75kqtj","1i14jv5","t1_m75hmjt","well im not approaching it from a perspective of whether this should be legal or not it should be 
im seeing this as a dangerous option which my previous comment tried to illustrate that such an implant might enable addicts to feel like they have a safety net that could then send them toward behaviors that are riskier  by not worrying about dying of an overdose  

sure this could save lives but pull your lens back toward a wider macro view and say a significant percentage of the people who opt to get these implants feel safe to shoot up more and more often and this delays their capacity to process a mental rock bottom to get them to want to quit  then is this such a clear positive technology   

i think this complicates matters   opioid addiction gets very ugly and anything that makes staying addicted by making you feel safer is to me a deceiving benevolent advancement","dbx999","2025-01-14 20:11:11","0"

how does someone dying of an od help them process a rock bottom  you dont think people will think oh shit i need to get this implanted in my chest so i dont die bc of this isnt post rock bottom or the actual rock bottom

the is clearly a positive technology because it keeps people alive and lets them work their way out of a bad place  you seem to be suggesting they deserve to die or have to die in order to want to quit  which is kinda weird dude

anything that keeps people alive and gives them a chance to work through recovery is a net positive  thinking people should have to die bc you dont like how their life is goingwhen they probably arent happy with it either is not a net positive for society

opioid addiction gets very ugly and anything that keeps people alive till they can beat the addiction is a benevolent advancement

once again its also not the safety net you think it is you dont die but you immediately have to go to a hospital so you dont die when it wears off and there are still opioids in your system  its not the easy way out that would be dying

so i guess what im asking is would you rather these people die  it would be better for folks to get off opiates but as weve seen as a society thats incredibly hard to do  so while people are working through their shit why not strive to keep them from dying

the device is nonstructural it acts on the structure by absorbing and transmitting force it has aspects of a gyroscope they show it as suspended off horizontal bracing with cross bracing connecting to column bases just above the top of the foundation so it would transit horizontal force mostly through the beam above with some traveling the struts vertical force would be the opposite 

its essentially an amplifier of crossbracing it works similarly to an analogue speaker like the carbon speakers in old phones all it does is affect waves as they transit through it

its literally a mental health disease where the brain is completely rewired while i agree that we need to look at this from a different perspective no one deserves to die from something their body no longer has control over

by the time i graduated high school in 2011 2  retired veterans in my neighborhood had overdosed from their legally prescribed opiates and died they died with in 4 years of retirement 

2 years later in 2013 my father would die from overdosing on his opiates he retired in 2008 so objectively was lucky he made it 5 years 

when youre so fucking high on pain medications that you cant remember if you took your pills or not and youre in pain so you think maybe you didnt you are a great candidate for overdose  not with this tool 

if this technology had been around they might still be here today i grew up in camp lejeune and watched as former servicemen members dropped like flies from the opiate epidemic it was prescribed then now its fentanyl because the va wont prescribe pain medications like it should its killing them even faster this doesnt make them bad people and doesnt mean they should die

im not asking what you think is right or wrong and i dont really care what your stance on addiction is but people turn to substances for all kinds of reasons i hope it doesnt happen to you your spouse your kids your parents your friends or your neighbors but you never know odds are all of you have one if not more addict in your lives maybe its you if not today maybe tomorrow i hope it doesnt happen in your life but it might tools like this can make a difference and save lives

"m7frkgt","1i2nfov","t3_1i2nfov","from the articlehttpsinterestingengineeringcominnovationmitrobotbeesbreakpollinationrecord mit researchers are designing robotic insects capable of swarming from mechanical hives to handle precise pollination tasks efficiently

the team designed their tiny flying robots to be significantly more agile and robust than previous iterations drawing inspiration from the anatomy of natural pollinators like bees

more than 100 times longer than previously shown the new bots can hover for over 1000 seconds additionally there is enough room in the new design for the robot to carry small sensors or batteries which could allow it to fly independently outside of the lab

the amount of flight we demonstrated in this paper is probably longer than the entire amount of flight our field has been able to accumulate with these robotic insects with the improved lifespan and precision of this robot we are getting closer to some very exciting applications like assisted pollination says kevin chen an associate professor in the department of electrical engineering and computer science eecs and the senior author of research paper in a statement","chrisdh79","2025-01-16 12:06:05","4"

to quote from the supplementary materials provided

external power supply
in these three experiments the robot was driven
at 1700 v and the optimal frequency for each hinge

external flight controller
we designed a flight controller for this robot the robot operates in a motion capture arena fig
s3a that provides position and attitude tracking at 400 hz the flight controller runs offboard in
the simulink realtime environment at 2 khz 

it seems unlikely they will ever be able to fit enough battery and still have room for the high voltage supply and flight controller within the total payload of just over half a gram","scintilist","2025-01-16 16:41:06","4"

so much i want to say to you but im not the shitty person i use to be i feel really bad for you to have such a shitty viewpoint on other human beings to be honest its quite ignorant and it builds on the stigmatization of that disease

compare what youve gone through or are continuing to go through to the life story of a recovering addict youll find a lot of similarities in your story and theirs hell try to read a book or listen to a recovering addicts podcast itll open up your perspective on things although it doesnt sound like you want to think about others 

i hope what youre going through isnt something that will ruin your life i hope what you have gone through and will go through in the future will make you stronger please ask for the help when you need it even if you dont want to 

just because i disagree with you doesnt mean i cant be empathetic towards you life is hard enough as it is we may think that each others view point is stupid or ignorant but i get to wish you well 

like bill and ted always said be excellent to each other

"m7n263x","1i1utnt","t3_1i1utnt","misleading article propagating a public misunderstanding of research into polygenic disease risk theyve attributed 58 of the risk to these genes which is not directly useful for treatment 

just because a risk is inherited doesnt mean we can understand it from examining the genome we can only currently identify clear genetic causes for disorders caused by the most straightforward and easily understood changes as the recent news about huntingtons shows we are only starting to fully understand how an easy to genetically identify disorder leads functionally to disease

from this papers abstract polygenic scores trained using european or multiancestry data predicted md status across all ancestries explaining up to 58 of md liability variance in europeans

in other words despite evidence that risk is substantially heritable only a small fraction of that can be explained by what we understand of the genetic changes we examined this is actually a pretty high percentage researchers are having even less success modeling autism genetically despite enormous amounts of research of this and similar types

the core issue is that there are still large fundamental gaps in our ability to understand and model phenotype what is expressed in the organism from genotype what is coded in dna were making advances but decades more of basic research is needed to make full use of the data that sequencing technology has given us access to our access to epigenetic data is also much more limited and may also be critical piece of the puzzle biology is complicated

these results could be useful clues for researchers trying tease apart how the biology works for this and many other heritable disorders that are not due to well understood genetic changes which is most of them they arent directly useful for treatment","SwirlingSilliness","2025-01-17 15:23:25","1"

there are no programs that help a middle aged white woman get one of these i am not doing a gofundme for an honesttogod medical necessity our government is fucking ridiculous 

i fell on the ice two days ago trying to bring in a heavy bag of dog food i am bruised from sternum to hips and my neck is killing me my arm my only hand hurts so much that i cant move my elbow i am miserable and i am having trouble breathing it hurts so much but i dont have insurance so im simply staying home and hoping for the best

"m7og67d","1i2s4zm","t1_m7obc8z","exactly risks need to be considered and thats a complex issue but right now were using fluoropolymers in everything from fashion accessories to burger wrappers and microwave popcorn this is incredibly stupid and i think pretty much everyone other than those making money selling those products can agree this is not any sort of reasonable risk assessment given what we now know about pfas actual wax paper works fine for burger wrappers and natural rubber nitrile rubber or other far more environmentally responsible elastomers work just great for watch bands or shoe components 

but when you get to technical applications the question of whether or not its worth the risk of the nasty chemistry behind these materials gets much trickier unfortunately its nowhere near as simple as your initial statement that as long as you keep it below decomposition temperature its fine 

the world is getting ever more crowded the availability of resources we depend on like clean air and water ever more challenged by our sheer numbers and industrial activity if we want to keep from creating a polluted hellscape we need to consider the entire lifecycle of products how theyre made how theyre disposed of what components can be feasibly recycled and what the decay process for the nonrecyclable parts looks like synthetic polymers are one of the big problems there they do not have unlimited chemical stability and as they wear into smaller particles the chemical reactivity increases as a function of surface area so polymers made of toxic basic chemistry like halogenated hydrocarbons generally go back to toxic materials as they decay even if the fully polymerized form is inert there may be ways to engineer a better decay path for polymers im a physicist not a polymer chemist so i dont know how feasible that is but maybe thats one path or we avoid synthetic polymers in favor of natural polymers like cellulose and polyisoprene for which the ecosystem already has a way of fully decomposing without producing an abundance of long lasting poisonous intermediate products","Palimpsest0","2025-01-17 19:24:16","1"

"m7p5ymt","1i2s4zm","t1_m7od7un","well im not a chemist im a physicist but i have worked with design and development of advanced technology equipment mostly on semiconductor fabrication capital equipment and process development for semiconductors but also in aerospace and biomedical so ive had a lot of overlap with chemists materials scientists and so on and done a lot of work on materials compatibility and reliability under extreme conditions

so my nonchemist understanding is that basically a polymer is made from a precursor chemical and in the reaction step there is like in all chemical reactions a little leftover from the reaction chemistry all proceeds by probabilities so with lots of reactants you start out with a fast reaction and then it slows as the reactants get consumed and there is generally some bits left over this leads to traces of unreacted precursors in a finished polymer material which can leach out just to stick with the example of ptfe it was originally made from a pfas called perfluorooctanoic acid which is one of the long lived toxic pfas of concern this was later changed to a proprietary compound called genx a different pfas that was supposed to break down and not accumulate and be less toxic its not its actually worse for you than perfluorooctanoic acid so there are traces of these materials in ptfe whether billet pellets for casting coatings whatever around the time the dangers of these materials was becoming understood dupont spun off their ptfe and pfa production into a subsidiary chemours which the cynic in me thinks is probably a way to limit liability to the main company they know lawsuits are probably coming 

in any case production storage handling and disposal of the precursors is where a lot of pfas environmental contamination comes from the next source is leaching of small amounts of these materials leftover in finished product into the environment which is especially a problem with food packaging coated in these materials then finally theres the fact that this material does break down and as it does so it breaks into random length fluorocarbon chains some reacted with whatever cleaved the polymer chains making a whole range of fluorinated organic compounds most of which are not exactly good for you this happens quickly at high temperature but with reactive chemicals that are common in the environment like ozone or hydrogen sulfide and uv radiation from sunlight etc theres a low probability very low that any bond in the polymer can be broken at room temperature so its pretty stable stuff at low temps but not infinitely so most of these effects are surface effects thats where its exposed to environmental chemicals and uv so as a ptfe item gets scratched chipped eroded etc the surface area goes up from increasing roughness and small particles broken off it and the probability of depolymerization goes up due to the higher surface area and the stuff really starts to shed various fluorinated organic compounds more quickly 

so my view is that while fluoropolymers are outstanding technical materials that have a lot of use cases where nothing else will do that really should be the thought process that goes into using them it shouldnt be something like injection molded fkm from china is a really cheap way to make a durable elastic bracelet or customer opinion surveys say our customers prefer nongreasy wrappers for our greasy burgers or other such convenience uses","Palimpsest0","2025-01-17 21:32:10","4"
"m7p8t25","1i2s4zm","t1_m7ok6kj","its nasty stuff fluorine alone is reactive as hell so much so that water spontaneously burns in a fluorine atmosphere but why stop there with a few kilowatts of rf energy you can make it into angry fluorine and get something even more reactive 

seriously though the scale on which it is used in my industry is a tiny whiff of gas at very low pressure in a vacuum chamber with very scrubbed exhaust its used to etch silicon and dielectrics very precisely into tiny structures in semiconductor devices and does it quickly plus your precursor can be a fluorocarbon gas instead of elemental fluorine so its much safer to store and transport and relatively inert its still bad for the environment but about on par with old fashioned refrigerant chemicals not melt your face off if it leaks so turning that fluorocarbon into a plasma gives you a nice very reactive etchant out of a relatively safe starting gas which then reacts with the silicon youre etching plus the carbon it came with to produce mostly solid residues that can be be captured and disposed of so its not just because its a highly reactive etchant that its used its also because its one that can be made on demand by turning it into a plasma but the starting material is safer to store and handle than acids elemental fluorine or other possible etchants","Palimpsest0","2025-01-17 21:46:20","1"

as i said in another reply the oversimplification of keeping ptfe at the proper temperature was just meant to illustrate that safety and risk mitigation improve dramatically as we learn more about what were messing with as we learn more characteristics of the materials we use we gradually get better at not killing ourselves with them that said there is so much more to this whole side of chemistry that i havent learned yet but discussions like these help a lot

i appreciate your looking at this from the perspective of our relationship with resources the question of why were so comfortable with this stuff in everything around us is an incredibly important one that wasnt even on my mind and i think you nailed the most significant answer were much more likely to misuse and overuse something when its such an available alternative and much less concerned with how safe it is when it seems the only viable option","Smart-Collar-4269","2025-01-17 22:54:18","0"

i dont think it would be the same chemical both perfluorooctanoic acid and genx are compounds that polymerize to form ptfe i dont think youd want that for a lubricant but maybe something related the whole group of fluorinated organic compounds is a minefield as far as safety so theres been several cases i recall of this is safer followed by uh nevermind

"m8dagyd","1i5qd5j","t1_m8899h2","as far as i understand the biggest risk is going to be a sodium fire sodium is water reactive 

the liquid sodium is not under pressure and if it gets too hot the power generation naturally decreases to the point where it no longer generates power 

maintenance is key to a good operation the reactor will be relatively maintenance free due to not being under pressure and being essentially a holding tank for liquid sodium the molten salt side will probably need some maintenance as well as the turbine 

but not having coal residue will be a big part of maintaining the process 

as far as hiring people to oversee they have jobs posted on their website for different positions at the facility kemmerer has 3000 people so if youre qualified there is a good chance they will have you in for an interview 

its not like a city where you have tom dick and harry all with experience degrees and great references and you get to choose who interviews best you may have a 1 decent candidate within 100 miles of kemmerer that everyone wants given there is quite a few facilities in that 100 miles","one8sevenn","2025-01-21 16:16:07","1"

abstract is appropriate because the authors demonstrated an abstract regard for piano playing 

first anyone who has had to master a fugue with five voices will tell you that the limit of what is possible to play is set by anatomy the finger dexterity acquired for demanding pieces cannot be sustainably improved by any means other than practice and talent 

theres no complex finger movement that the existing repertoire doesnt already require 

second theres zero accounting for interpretation beethoven was widely acclaimed as a pianist not for his technical ability but for his interpretive skill in fact beethoven was often a fairly clumsy player but his errors were overlooked because he brought real power and passion to his playing

power plants generally run the same and the trona mines also use steam but the nuclear aspect you might need an expert but high pressure steam shouldnt be an issue with the current workforce in the area there are different challenges through the operating plants in the area the trona mines are gassy shute creek has h2s oilcoal have flammable and combustible materials or liquids the one thing they dont have in people experienced in radiation uranium mines are jeffery city to douglas which they could potentially pull from 

i imagine they will hire heavily from naughton bridger williams the coal mines shute creek carter creek and the trona mines for operators to run the plants they could also get maintenance folks from there too 

same with construction civil electrical and iron construction on industrial facilities generally require a specialized contractor good contractors also have their own safety people and project managers they move from job to job and build they come in get the job done and then move to the next job

as far as safety nuclear power plants are one of the safest operations they are also very clean not saying you should eat off the floor but you probably could  lots of fail safes that are built in to conventional ones and lots of submarines with the technology that is it fails youre killing navy service personnel 

with safety cultures its generally on the people you hire you can have all the programs and policies in place to follow all the regulations which will be the same as your competitors for insurance profitability and other financial reasons  most people would be shocked at how quickly insurance premiums go up if your incident rate gets too high you could go from 100k to over a million in a year very easily  with this being known youll have one facility will be safe and the other will be a disaster waiting to happen 

i worked on a project in arizona great culture and great people productive safe and ahead of schedule i got transferred to nevada and it was the complete opposite same company different culture and different people 


i dont think i would expect fatal accidents on this project will there be injuries sure 

however this is probably the best time in history to be working at an industrial plant with modern technology operators can look at computer screens all days and make a lot of the previously hands on changes with a click of a mouse 

hell even with maintenance portable welding units the size of a small generator cable pulling machines robotic racking devices for mcc buckets  etc so many tools that are going to save knees backs and wrists that werent available for the previous generation 

then you take this modern technology and apply it to a new plant i think the risk of fatality goes way down","one8sevenn","2025-01-21 19:53:09","1"

the left half of bugorskis face swelled up beyond recognition and over the next several days the skin started to peel revealing the path that the proton beam had burned through parts of his face his bone and the brain tissue underneath as it was believed that he had received far in excess of a fatal dose of radiation bugorski was taken to a clinic in moscow where the doctors could observe his expected demise however bugorski survived completed his phd and continued working as a particle physicist there was virtually no damage to his intellectual capacity but the fatigue of mental work increased markedly bugorski completely lost hearing in the left ear replaced by a form of tinnitus the left half of his face was paralysed due to the destruction of nerves he was able to function well except for occasional complex partial seizures and rare tonicclonic seizures","PhuqBeachesGitMonee","2025-01-23 18:42:18","4"

the difference here is that instead of real women being indentured under that its actual objects every man in a fake relationship with one of these things is not abusing a real woman

while i absolutely agree that this is the current situation i would say that is water well under the bridge at least i cant see any solution to it and it seems to be still accelerating given that and again thats my opinion you may not agree

 then using technology to remedy social isolation

seems like  a very good thing if indeed thats what the tech ends up doing

 in this case its specifically about social isolation leading to lack of sex

i just want to reraise the point that there are many other causes of social isolation and also lack of sex which are related but distinct nonetheless i suspect that people who are isolatedlacking  for whatever reason  may be more concerned with some form of more sophisticated relief than they are about what other people think of how they cobble up their own solution

i had a truly amazing 24 years with a wonderful woman until cancer took her from me not so long ago my own isolation is tolerable because i remember her so well and find that to be fulfilling i cant see starting over however it does instill in me a deep sympathy for those who have andor had no one at all and may never have anyone for that matter

also as a person who leans quite strongly into informed personal and consensual choice im uncomfortable with people inserting themselves into the decision making process of the individual","NYPizzaNoChar","2025-01-23 19:48:33","0"

will this limit yet more emotional connection between people as sex bots are just easier than real relationships

what will this do to birth rates

the pentagon mandates that all us drones must have a man in the loop under dod directive 300009 autonomy in weapon systems but really if a robot is a sensor an effector and a box to hold it together then the og autonomous weapon system is a land mine

these autonomous weapons are just landmines that can chase you 

the pentagon has spilled a lot of ink on the debate between the moral requirement of a man in the loop vs war at machine speed but i think that once battlefield losses to automated forces start mounting then everyone will be forced to deploy edge ai under a powertotheedge doctrine

again i am not an expert im not trying to be an expert but my layman understanding is they can support super hot plasma to melt water using a very specific material that material can be changed into another and then fed back into the process this shows step 1 but not step 2 i dont think anyone has solved step 2

once step 2 is shown to be solved then itd need to be scaled then implemented into step 1

1 carbon nanotubes they work great for storing a shit ton of energy required unfortunately while the math is pretty solid the manufacturing is anywhere between jimmy accidentally inventing a process in his garage tomorrow or a lab brute forcing a process in 25 years

2 do you want a laser that points forever or do you want plasma the laser would be easy but inaccurate to the spirit of lightsabers so you need plasma we have plasma torches hacksmith sells lightsabers that are just torches 

2b ok you want plasma that you can sword fight with then you essentially need a collapsible telescoping element that wont break while fighting but can either deliver plasma gas or exist as the heating element itself to the point where it glows back to carbon nanotubes 

3 so it turns out you can spend millions of dollars of equipment and expertise to manipulate individual atoms to make carbon nanotubes  you could make a real one it would probably take about 25 years of atom by atom assembly assuming no other issues arise while trying to make the structure of the tubes and assuming that math is right even then after all that work youd blind yourself with the light required","piratecheese13","2025-01-24 17:14:14","1"

1 every new product ie a nn model to detect lung disease from an pet image has to start out as a advanced technology development project this is a different classification than long lived projects like building hardware for a ct machine
2 the model architecture model goal and other parameters have to be discussed and set well before training
3 data takes a long time to get usually from participating hospitals or research universities and has to pass a bunch of legal hoops and hipaa and hitech regulations
4 finally training can start sometimes it produces a helpful model sometimes its a wash 
5 once you have something useful then starts the verification and validation process that can take months to years to pass essentially you have to proof with hundreds of documents test and more that this model does what you say it does that in the eyes of the fda its safe and effective keep in mind no further development can be done on the model or else this step has to be repeated 
6 once its passed at you have your certification you can finally start releasing the model in production if you lucky the hospital will allow for over the air updates and can install the new ai model into its pet or mri system this is also the case with hospitals that have some of their services running in the cloud in many cases hospitals have service contracts and for various reasons a field engineer needs to physically go and upload the software and model onto the system 
7 nice you finally put ai into a healthcare setting optimistically setup and data obtaining takes a few months development is a few months and the fda process is 618 months

lets say you want to preemptively use a cheap test on your entire at risk population where on average 10 of people will be sick and the model only gives you a 1 false positive or people being told theyre sick while they actually arent 

if you test a million people 100000 people will have the disease of which 97000 will be recognised and 3000 wont on the other hand you will be treating 10000 people who were told theyre sick while they actually arent 

in reality many use cases involve way lower rates than 10 for example when testing an at risk population for cancer these models need an extremely low false positive rate to be useful or you will actually be treating more healthy than sick people just some nuance as many articles tend to oversell medical innovation","CryptoJeans","2025-01-25 06:34:15","1"

aids acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is just the condition where youve had hiv for long enough without treatment that it has damaged your immune system enough that you are more vulnerable to other types of infection  it takes somewhere around 67 years on average for this to occur after someone is infected with the hiv virus of course on treatment usually just one pill once a day or we now even have a long acting injectable people with hiv never progress to the point of immunodeficiency","threaddew","2025-01-25 19:00:57","1"

one works by finding patterns in big data that  may or may not be useful for scientists to propose new developments taking into account its issues like bias sampling ethics  this means they are not above this  and like other serious scientific experiments they need to be equally questioned while giving the illusion of lack of external issues

generative ai which is supposedly the creative one is a mere parody of real llm and procedural generation technologies that rely on complex human code   generative ai finds patterns from big data to create the most likely outcome  which is an hallucination in essence which the black box of training data doesnt allow for any methodical analysis

conflating both  as ai is a marketing strategy that most scientists big data analysts and  creative procedural developers as in visual music and game procedural generation oppose for all the right reasons

there is already a very strong feeling in a lot of countries against cloning and genetically designing children the times they have succeeded there has been a pretty big backlash against it 

people have seen too many scifi scenarios where this kind of thing went horribly wrong theyre afraid of it and can only see it ending in a real life eugenics war theyve seen historical examples the nazis trying to do this kind of thing breeding children to look like stereotypical aryans 

this kind of science has its advantages if you can correct genetic defects before a child is even born isnt that great but genetically engineering a child to fit fashionable expectations thats kind of ick when you really think about it

i can definitely see genetically enhanced athletes being barred from sports competitions enhanced musical artists being seen as unfair stuff like that","mtempissmith","2025-01-27 13:21:13","0"

if the drug succeeds in clinical trials which this will probably take neither 57 years to have any sort of efficacy data another 5 for a pivotal trialapproval there will be a patent life of about 1015 years the cost of the drug will be determined by a host of factors primarily its cost will depend on the perceived reduction of healthcare burden through efficacy httpsicerorg and the differential between the likely generic soc pricing and the benefitrisk 

usually pharma companies try for disease indications that have little options for patients they do this because the larger the leap in benefit for the patient the more profits and competitive moat against competition over the life of the patent once the patent expires the whole world can buy the drug closer to cost cogs

further dna and rna is transformational its not just linear strands parts of the molecules attach and twist and enhance expression what if you knock out a perceived cancer gene but later realize its tied to the ability to see dnarna is very complex this is not as simple as make an eggsperm this could really lead to horrible outcomes it a very slippery slope playing these games of life","briechies","2025-01-27 14:59:10","1"

mole rats are not humans they have more efficient dna repair pathways and different immune systems 
humans may not have the molecular infrastructure to replicate such a system not to mention performing such a gene therapy on a human could result in disastercomplete wipe out their immune system and hope the genetically modified cells take over

humans live vastly different lives than naked mole rats 

apples and oranges like saying dogs have a super sense of smell why cant humans different infrastructure entirely

yes there are genetic similarities but it does not mean it will translate the same even the same sequence could result in different effects based on methylation and post transcriptional modifications

we all rely on cheap energy costs across everything energy price matters old methods were standard electric grids thats produced from burning oil now we as a species can just manifest literal suns with effective 0 losscost energy 

the us doesnt have any fusion reactors to my knowledge we use fission like exploding hot rocks they expand and break down theres still some loss over time and nuclear byproducts 

whereas fusion if perfected gets very scifi whoever does it would then have literal infinite energy for x amount of time and for 0 cost it would break all world power structures if anyone can truly unlock that technology safely oil reserves would be useless 

the energy would keep expanding and fusing with itself in theory for millions of years its kind of a massive thing for humanity building a grid around perfectfusion could power and change things to scale of an industrial revolution squared by itself","Sufficient-Noise4918","2025-01-27 21:41:53","1"

for exampleif you have a single copy of the gene responsible for sickle cell disease you have a much better chance of surviving malaria at the cost of some of your blood cells being sickle shaped not functioning as well etc

having copies means most of your blood cells end up that way and you often have severe health problems as a result  
  
eliminating that might seem good but you lose the resistance to malaria in many cases that may be an acceptable tradeoff but a significant reduction in the genetic diversity of the population could have major consequences 

the outcome of pandemic covid19 or whatever the term is now could have been far more devastating without that diversity even with a rapidly developed vaccine many more people could have died much more quickly","istarian","2025-01-27 22:01:16","1"

"m9o24ty","1ib7brl","t1_m9l13jr","we should be very careful about assuming we understand enough about human biology human  and genetics before getting too hasty about making changes  
  
genetics is complex and genetic mutations that consistently cause severe disease tend to not persist in the population because individuals get sick and die without reproducing  
  
that means that most changes that have persisted over time are either beneficial somehow or have only a modest impact on survival and reproduction

in our attempts to rid ourselves of genetic diseases we could well make ourselves extra susceptible to something else in the environment like viruses or bacterialfungal infections  
  
  
  
it would be great if we could reliably prevent anyone from actual suffering from cystic fibrosis but there are also plenty of people that carriers because just a single copy of the gene doesnt cause as much of a problem","istarian","2025-01-28 17:24:27","1"

in absolute terms they increased pcr by 10 14 to 24 in the overall population some subgroups did better in the 30 of patients with pdl1 1 which we dont routinely test in adjuvant improved pcr from 20 to 44 in the remaining 70 of patients with pdl1 1 the improvement was a much more modest 10 to 14

happy for a breast oncologist to disagree with me but nothing in this paper is that surprising to me we already have data from keynote522httpswwwnejmorgdoifull101056nejmoa1910549 that the addition of immunotherapy to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in triplenegative breast cancer has improved complete response rate what that trial also had that this one doesnt is event free survival ie was there a reduction in death and cancer recurrence they talk in this paper that there was a protocol amendment that allowed unblinding and they reclassified event free survival as an exploratory outcome but its not clear to me why

from a pharma perspective theres a lot more er breast cancer out there than triplenegative so they would love to get immunotherapy into that market going rate for nivolumab is something like 9000 per cycle trial did 8 preop and 7 post cycles so thats about an extra 135000 probably more like 105000 based upon bulk buy over the relatively trivial cost of chemotherapy based upon a surrogate outcome im sure in the us this is going to be offered up immediately but in the rest of the world i dont know that were going to want to fund this without a hard outcome","Canuck147","2025-01-29 02:50:56","1"

in april last year researchers at the rogel cancer center at university of michigan um health announcedhttpswwwauajournalsorgdoi101097ju0000000000004421 that they had developed a new urinebased test that could help with early detection specifically their test known as myprostatescore20 or mps2 was able to distinguish between positive tests for a slowgrowing form of prostate cancer thats unlikely to cause harm and the more aggressive form of the disease requiring rapid medical treatment it works by screening for 18 different genes associated with aggressive prostate cancer

however when mps2 was first tested and deployed it involved the collection of urine after a digital rectal exam dre this phase was necessary it was believed because pressure on the prostate through the rectum would release cellular debris from the walnutshaped organ that could then be analyzed in the urine stream the requirement for a dre also meant that mps2 needed to be conducted in a doctors office

however in a new followup study the um researchers collected firstcatch urine samples from 266 men who did not undergo a dre first they found that mps2 was effective in detecting 94 of the problematic aggressive prostate cancer which are those falling in a designation known as grade group 2 or gg2 that success rate places the test above those carried out on blood samples

in further mathematical analysis the team says that the test could have helped up to 53 of men avoid biopsies

these results show that mps2 has promise as an athome test says study coauthor ganesh s palapattu a um professor of urology its primary benefit is that the test can accurately predict your probability of developing aggressive prostate cancer putting both the patient and physician at ease","chrisdh79","2025-01-29 13:16:23","4"

the engines dont exist yet  those power everything from actual flight to electricity generation pressurization and depending on design hydraulic flight control  that means that none of those systems have been designed yet since pressures and numbers and even how things connect to each other cant be finalized  theyre trying for a no window flight deck so that the nose and hull are a seamless much stronger shape and it can be mounted much further back using multiple redundant cameras and high definition screens which has never been certified for commercial use  even once all of that has been finished it will still need exhaustive flight testing more than a conventional more proven design must go through  even once the design is fully validated they still have create the assembly design which is the step by step method and factory tooling which will also be unique for it to be constructed  that is as big of an undertaking as designing the aircraft itself and has to be tested validated and approved  even once all of that is done use in a 121 airline environment requires designing a maintenance program pilot training program flight manuals emergency procedures minimum equipment lists simulators and an sop  none of that can be skipped most of it cant be done simultaneously and all of it takes years

its kinda cool that they have a flying aerodynamic demonstrator but it should be understood that that is a step below a prototype realistically theyre only a very small percentage of the way to a functional airliner  boeing had to rightfully ground hundreds of 737 max aircraft for half a year to fix and validate a single system this thing is entirely new  it will take many years to get through all these processes even assuming that everything works right the first time

"m9vnrln","1icsxaw","t1_m9uz9qw","one of the main reasons against super sonic flight is the inefficiencies around less than super sonic speeds the aerodynamics of flying at subsonic speeds is different than at supersonic speeds 

when you think of a passenger plane you think of large flat wings angled almost perpendicular to the body with smooth curves this is a great design to maximize lift required for flight in supersonic speeds the angle of the wings vs the body cannot remain perpendicular because this would cause too much drag as well as create vibrations potentially damaging the body so to design away from this you have to angle the wings back shorten the wings and add sharper angles like you see in fighter jets 

the issue though is the design to handle the speeds of supersonic flight make it terribly inefficient at those lower speeds this requires you to add more thrust burn more fuel to counteract the lack to lift

lastly add in that localities didnt like to have the sonic booms associated with supersonic flight over land and you have a situation where you are burning a lot of fuel to get to the ocean to fly at those speeds","LabOwn9800","2025-01-29 19:49:16","1"

"ma0ewoc","1i14jv5","t3_1i14jv5","researchers have developed the implantable system for opioid safety isos a groundbreaking underskin device designed to prevent opioid overdose deaths the implant functions by automatically detecting signs of an overdose such as dangerously slowed breathing and then dispensing naloxone a lifesaving medication that rapidly reverses the effects of opioids

unlike traditional naloxone administration methods such as nasal sprays or injections isos ensures immediate intervention without requiring external assistance this is particularly crucial for individuals who may be alone during an overdose where timely intervention can be the difference between life and death

the implant operates using biosensors that continuously monitor physiological signals in the bloodstream if the system detects signs of respiratory depression or opioidinduced distress it automatically releases a controlled dose of naloxone restoring normal breathing and reducing the risk of fatal overdose

this technology has the potential to significantly reduce opioidrelated fatalities especially as the opioid crisis continues to claim thousands of lives each year while still in the research phase isos represents a major advancement in harm reduction strategies offering a proactive and autonomous approach to combating opioid overdoses","coherentmarkets","2025-01-30 14:08:37","4"

"ma6l6ll","1ieddnq","t3_1ieddnq","from the article hiv has become a more manageable condition in recent years but a full cure remains elusive now scientists have found promise in permanently eliminating the virus thanks to a drug already approved by the fda to fight cancer

once a death sentence human immunodeficiency virus hiv can now be managed with antiretroviral therapy art drugs this treatment suppresses the virus to undetectable levels which in turn means its untransmittible allowing patients to live fairly normal lives however the virus still lays dormant inside infected cells and will reemerge if the therapy is stopped

a new studyhttpswwwscienceorgdoi101126sciadvads1911 led by researchers at stanford has now shown that a compound called ebc46 can reactivate these dormant cells allowing them to then be targeted by immunotherapy this is called a kick and kill strategy and in theory at least it could completely clear the virus from a patient

the team tested 15 variations of ebc46 on latent hivinfected cells in lab dishes incredibly some versions of the compound reactivated up to 90 of the cells which is far higher than the 20 achieved by other drugs another reportedly managed a 40 clearance rate in mice

our studies show that ebc46 analogs are exceptional latency reversing agents representing a potentially significant step toward hiv eradication said paul wender senior author of the study

of course theres a long road between tests in cells and human trials with animal trials underway first but in this case at least that road looks somewhat smooth ebc46 has previously been approved for use in dogs and humans as a cancer treatment so safety data is already being gathered

being able to effectively cure hiv would be a major boon to patients on art the treatment can be costly and requires a lifetime of adherence so it remains unfeasible in some regions","chrisdh79","2025-01-31 12:12:31","4"

there are some trials in progress and hiv has been cured in a few cases through stem cell transplantation however the procedure is extremely intensive and risky so its not a realistic option for most people living with hiv which is why its not widely available","zeroparticles6901","2025-02-01 06:11:13","1"

shinin lasers on tiny space sails to see how hard they git pushed

alright so scientists got this crazy idea to send tiny space sails flyin through the stars using nothin but lasers these here lightsails are super thinlike a hair on a fleas backand could be the best way to check out faroff planets but dang it nobodys really tested em proper to see how they hold up

so these smart fellers rigged up a tiny little sheet thinner than a spiderweb and shined a laser on it to see how it wiggles and heats up turns out even a teensy bit of laser power gives it a pushbout 70 femtowhatchamacallits of force which is real small but it adds up in space they also checked how the angle of the laser and the size of the beam change the push since a real lightsail aint just gonna go straight they tested how it scoots sideways too

end of the day this fancy test helps em figure out how to make these space sails work for real so one day we might just shoot em out with lasers and see where they end up","OOBExperience","2025-02-01 18:42:32","0"

both centauri a and centauri c have a planet in the habitable goldilocks zone but nothing more is known about the make up of those planets","LonelyGuyTheme","2025-02-02 06:24:07","1"

in this system its basically the same as that except the transfer case is built into the transmissiontransaxle too and instead of using differentials it just has direct drive clutch packs to the output of the transfer cases

auto makers specifically dont do it this way because its basically nonserviceable as a standard product koenigsegg did it because their product isnt really meant to be driven just displayed","SileAnimus","2025-02-02 09:50:25","1"

beyond the realm of the physical world where particles are involved in simple roles like carrying charge or existing as matter there is the quantum world where particles pass through solid barriers or communicate via large distances even though they are not connected in any manner 

scientists are exploring the mechanics of this world so that they can be used to advance technologies like computing and sensing however so much remains unknown and is waiting to be discovered like the fractional excitons that brown university researchers observed for the first time recently 

in quantum mechanics an exciton is a particle formed by the combination of an electron and a positive hole to which it is attracted excitons carry no charge so they are hard to detect from theoretical calculations scientists know that even fractional excitons exist but detecting them is even harder 

this is where brown researchers used the fractional quantum hall effect as per the classical quantum hall effect when an electric current is applied to a material placed in a magnetic field it produces a sideways voltage 

this phenomenon occurs at extremely low temperatures and high magnetic fields with voltage increases occurring in clear separate jumps in the fractional quantum hall effect the jumps occur in fractional amounts the researchers applied this knowledge to observe fractional electrons","chrisdh79","2025-02-04 12:21:23","4"

got it lets bring this down to earth with money and banks something super relatable

normal world

imagine youre at a bank you have an account with 10 in it you move your money around and the bank tells you exactly how much you have at any time if you deposit 5 more the system updates and you now have 15no surprises everything follows the rules of math and banking

quantum world

now picture a weird bank where money doesnt behave like youd expect
		you withdraw 10 but when you check your account 5 is somehow still there
		two accounts on opposite sides of the world suddenly show changes even though no transfer was made
		a new kind of currency exists that acts like a teamup between two elementskind of like an electron negative charge and a positive hole an absence of charge together they balance each other out and behave like a ghost transaction thats hard to track

this ghost currency in the quantum bank is like an exciton its not real money you can spend and its hard to find but its crucial in this strange world

fractional excitons and the quantum hall effect

now scientists have theorized that even fractions of these ghost transactions might exist but no one had seen proof before enter the fractional quantum hall effect

think of it like weird bank rules during an audit under extreme conditions very low temperature and high magnetic field instead of deposits and withdrawals happening in full 1 increments they happen in fractions like 025 steps this phenomenon allows scientists to finally detect and measure those tiny fractional transactions

by using this quantum audit method researchers at brown university observed fractional excitons for the first time its a breakthrough that could one day revolutionize how we build new technology much like discovering fractional banking systems would change global finance

real life example

think of quantum computers like a bank where billions of transactions can happen instantly instead of one by one like todays computers detecting fractional excitons is like cracking the code to speed up this system by a thousand times

so in simpler terms scientists found proof of a new ghost transaction system in the quantum world which could one day make future computers unbelievably fast and efficient","iBetWeWin","2025-02-04 18:34:46","4"

wildland crews dont use as much water on the ground as you think theyre equipped with portable 2stroke water pumps and attack fires usually with 1 garden hose and are attacking hot spots and doing mopup theyre either drafting from a bladder or a lake for direct attack its pretty much all helicopters or bombers 

im on a firehall so i actually have some experience with urbaninterface situations and pretty much every fire ive been on were using pretty low pressure on 15175 lines on brush and running 20003500gal tenders to keep the bladders full were putting sprinklers on roofs to create defensive barriers and were doing other defensive operations in a full emergency scenario were not stopping single house fires were letting houses burn while we focus on stopping the spread and protecting exposures direct attack is again usually done by aerials

so i definitely could se this being useful in an urbaninterface setting to essentially create a big wetlinearea  youve gotta remember if this is being used to prevent fires then youre not actively using water to directly attack a fire a large part of how a fire spreads is embers and other materials falling on rooftops unmaintained eaves wood decks landscaping features mulch etc so youre trying to wet down all those things so fires dont start in the first place so with how small crews can be in rural areas this could save us a lot of time running around putting out hot spots and allow us to focus our resources on bigger fires once youre in the scenario of houses being on fire i bet youd be turning this thing off and changing strategies","NovaS1X","2025-02-08 16:35:30","1"

the resulting concrete shell spanning 3 m by 18 m weighs 1000 kg and is 5 cm at its thinnest and 13 cm at its thickest following conventional practices the floor system is completed with a circular fill to provide a flat top the corrugations provide structural height for live loads and a fascinating architectural expression not despite but because of the constraints of structural efficiency and fabrication economy","chocolate-pizza","2025-02-08 16:48:21","4"

you might actually be recalling mutant 59 the plastic eater a novel from 1971 by kit pedler and gerry davis or its very closely related tv ancestor the pilot episode of the bbc series doomwatch 1970 titled the plastic eaters

what happens in the plastic eaters  mutant 59

scientists develop a microbe designed to break down plastic waste

it mutates spreads uncontrollably and begins destroying every plastic it contacts including airplane components computer parts etc

society is thrown into chaos as modern technology which relies heavily on plastic fails

why its easy to conflate with another planet

although mutant 59 and the plastic eaters are set on earth its a sweeping disaster that feels almost planetary in scaleplanes crash infrastructure collapses and civilization is knocked back decades

many people who read or saw it years ago remember the story as though it were an entire world undone by runaway bacteria

no wellknown tv or movie plot has the exact offworld planet  plasticeating bacterium  total societal collapse back to horses premise most times this storyline is traced back to mutant 59 or doomwatch it is likely you saw one of theseor heard a summary of themand your memory filled in the whole planet aspect if youre certain what you saw was on tv doomwatch is probably the closest match if you read it as a novel then mutant 59 is the one","Futechteller","2025-02-09 15:17:38","1"

"mbvwj9n","1ilcol0","t1_mbv1ko5","when bacteria break the strong carbonfluorine bonds in pfas they essentially defluorinate the molecule this transformation changes a chemical that is highly resistant to natural breakdown into one that is much more familiarand more easily processedby living systems heres how the resulting chemicals are less harmful

1 reduced persistence and bioaccumulation

pfas are called forever chemicals because their fully fluorinated carbon chains are very stable and do not break down easily this stability leads to long environmental lifetimes and bioaccumulation in organisms when bacteria remove many or all of the fluorine atoms for example converting a pfas molecule into a nonfluorinated acid like octanoic acid the new molecule is no longer locked by those superstrong cf bonds in contrast to the original pfas the resulting molecule is much more biodegradable and less likely to accumulate in the food chain

2 enhanced biodegradability

many defluorinated products such as common fatty acids are naturally occurring in the environment and are readily used by microorganisms as a source of energy and carbon for instance in a simplified reaction model using perfluorooctanoic acid a pfas as an example bacteria might catalyze a reaction like

  cfoh  15 h  cho  15 hf

here the product cho octanoic acid is a naturally occurring organic acid that microbes can easily further break down in contrast the fully fluorinated starting material is resistant to microbial attack

3 lower toxicological impact

pfas exert many of their adverse effectssuch as endocrine disruption and interference with lipid metabolismbecause of their unique fluorinated structure which allows them to persist in organisms and interact in harmful ways with biological systems once the fluorine atoms are replaced by hydrogen the molecules properties change dramatically the defluorinated product like octanoic acid behaves much like ordinary fatty acids that are normally metabolized and cleared by the body reducing the risk of chronic toxicity

4 mitigation of released fluoride

although the breakdown process releases hydrofluoric acid hf under environmental conditions especially in waterrich and mineralcontaining soils hf tends to be rapidly neutralizedforming harmless fluoride salts this further diminishes the overall toxicity of the breakdown products compared to the original pfas compounds

in summary by removing the fluorine atoms that make pfas exceptionally persistent and bioaccumulative the bacteria transform these forever chemicals into molecules that are more in line with natural organic compounds these defluorinated chemicals are less likely to persist in the environment accumulate in organisms or interfere with biological functions

for further details on this process and its potential for pfas remediation see the new atlas article

when an investigation into contamination is triggered containment source is identified then soil and groundwater samples are collected from multiple depths going in rings outwards from the known contamination origin with the goal to find wellsdepths not impacted by contamination rings kinda like a tree where the heart is the contamination source and the bark would be clean samples contamination spreads through groundwater flow within the subsurface so taking into account groundwater flow and the soilsclays are important in understanding contaminate flow and spread ex clays within the subsurface can prevent downward contamination of lower water tables clays can also act as natural barriers to prevent further outward transport of contaminates 

standard first step in remediation is removing as much of the source of contamination as possible once the contamination boundaries are identified often called a plume you can then install groundwater wells to specific depths within the plumes or use existing wells if they satisfy the requirements to inject bacteriaoxidizersother remediation injections into the contamination based off the type of bacteria injected and the speed of water flow in the subsurface groundwater sampling is done every 312 months to track impact of the bacterial injections on contamination 

once studies are done and show efficacy and safety of the bacterial injection i have no doubt that the product will be widely used for environmental remediation the bacteria used in environmental remediation are highly selective and feed off the specific chemical theyre designed to target because of just how specific the bacteria are its unlikely that a remediation project using licensed bacterial agents will cause unanticipated harm the ongoing monitoring will ensure that if unanticipated harm occurs itll be identified quickly","redhotbananas","2025-02-09 21:44:15","4"

even if patients werent being tested for therapeutic levels they are routinely tested to check for neutropenia and other blood changes adding one more test isnt difficult

"mc1q5wt","1im4x9i","t1_mc1oiqm","appreciate your comments indeed i was speaking from an adult perspective and we dont test nearly any chemotherapy for therapeutic levels in that population and i admit i do not treat children but am familiar with at least some cog protocols the clinical trials are designed to give as much as humanely possible without harming most people and without respect to a therapeutic interval i use interval in this case to highlight subtherapeutic and supratherapuetic levels its crude but represents the best strategy we have currently for most people

yes we always love repurposing old treatments in new ways my concern is that practically the cost of digoxin itself is offset by need for close monitoring and dose adjustment as others pointed out digoxin testing can be multiple times per week and this represents a large burden to clinician and laboratory testing resources patients also shoulder the burden of cost and having to travel to lab or clinic for a blood draw

many physicians my oncologists certainly included are also generally uncomfortable with antiarrhythmics and would prefer to have those managed by cardiologists they can be quite tricky to use sometimes

imagine you send out two letters one is red and one is blue on the inside of the envelope once theyre sealed and mixed up they are entangled with a 5050 chance of being red if you send one across the world and open it the probability of the other letter being the opposite becomes certain regardless of the distance

"mc65to4","1imx7dw","t3_1imx7dw","from the articlehttpsinterestingengineeringcominnovationquantumcomputeropticalreadoutqubits researchers at the institute of science and technology in austria ista have achieved a major milestone in quantum computing after obtaining a complete optical readout of superconducting qubits

this will help in building scalable quantum computers that are robust operate at room temperature and at a much lower cost a press release said 

quantum computers are the next frontier of computing allowing calculations to occur at exponential rates compared to classical computers

at the core of the quantum computer is the quantum bit or qubit that can occupy multiple states at once allowing it to carry out multiple calculations at once as against its binary counterpart the bit 

to achieve this state scientists use properties of materials such as their superconductivity however these states can only be reached at temperatures close to absolute zero which then requires extensive cryogenic cooling infrastructure increasing computational costs 

even as work is ongoing on building scalable quantum computers some research groups are working to build the necessary network that it will need to operate just as the internet requires an extensive fiber optic network to operate quantum computers also need a network that can transport qubits 

rolling out a cryogenically cooled network globally is impossible so scientists are also working on using the existing fiber optic network to relay quantum information 

superconducting qubits are electrical by nature but have low bandwidth they can transmit little information over time and get easily overwhelmed by noise on the other hand optical signals are highbandwidth signals that can propagate with minimal losses

the information that a encoded into their particles is never transmitted through the optic fibre only classical information is which is more or less useless without the actual entangled particles the information teleports to b when they are given the right way to decode their result


sort of like if youd have two identical pieces of garbled text and give it to two parties then a does some conversion to it so that the text reads apples then they tell b hey use this and this method to convert the data and b does that and now they also have apples 


so how does quantum communication differ from this example well entangled particles are sort of a perfect safe you cant copy them and it is very easy to check if someone messed with the particles in any way meaning that you can securely transmit that garbled text that the two parties can use however they want and you can be sure that nobody can decipher what youre communicating even if they know the method of converting that text because they still need the actual text to know what it says","Affectionate-Pickle0","2025-02-11 16:38:26","1"

magnetoencephalography meg is a test that measures the magnetic fields your brains electrical currents produce healthcare providers use this test to map brain function and identify the exact location of the source of epilepsyrelated seizures  cleveland clinic 

apparently meg is noninvasive but they gotta do it in a shielded room or some shit like that bc of the earths magnetic fields being super strong 

an electroencephalogram is a test that measures electrical activity in the brain this test also is called an eeg the test uses small metal discs called electrodes that attach to the scalp brain cells communicate via electrical impulses and this activity shows up as wavy lines on an eeg recording
 mayo clinic

apparently eegs are used to diagnose shit like epilepsy dementia etc 

also they tested this on 35 healthy ppl they had people write shit down while undergoing an meg and then an eeg it looks like it had about 80 accuracy

the experiment was intended to quantify the effects of transcontinental supersonic transport sst aircraft on a city to measure the booms effect on structures and public attitude and to develop standards for boom prediction and insurance data

the norc reported that 73 of subjects in the study said that they could live indefinitely with eight sonic booms per day while a quarter said that they couldnt6 about 3 of the population telephoned sued or wrote protest letters but oklahoma city surgeons and hospitals filed no complaints
however with the city population at 500000 that 3 figure represented 15000 upset individuals there were 9594 complaints of damage to buildings 4629 formal damage claims and 229 claims for a total of 1284532 mostly for broken glass and cracked plaster9 the faa rejected 94 of all the claims it received fueling a rising tide of anger that soared even after the experiments conclusion

"mcazwn0","1in1ce5","t1_mc9kjf5","general rule of thumb for a sonic boom is the wave travels 1 mile for every 1000ft of altitude though like they said aerodynamic designs can mitigate the effect though in the case of xb1 and overture no excessive airframe shaping was needed at the speed xb1 flew and overture will be designed to fly over land they will experience mach cut off the boom wont even reach the ground

addressing the other concerns

just staying at a normal cruising speed at 60000 feet isnt the best option for efficiency general cruising speeds are 85 mach though that high up theres not a lot of air to generate lift at those altitudes so speed is key

the final production model is planned to cruise to 97 mach over land until they can get permission from the faa to go supersonic over land if permitted theyll travel mach 12  13 around where the cut off should be and when over seas oceans  certain areas over land theyll accelerate to mach 17

as for the tupolev thing achieves mach 2 using afterburners and a fuck load of fuel and isnt exactly the gold standard for quality of life the soviets did actually had a concorde competitor the tu144 and it suffered that exact problem loud shakey and fucking scary to ride in","supertacoboy","2025-02-12 03:11:46","4"

water is a great radiation shield for a spacecraft however it will slosh around randomly in space leaving gaps that let radiation through by making the water semisolid by encapsulating it in a hydrogel there are no gaps it also can be made into any shape so it can be used almost like fabric in a spacesuit if enclosed in a solid like a plastic liner","No-Philosopher3703","2025-02-12 15:36:28","1"

for satellites where most of the initial energy came from the launch rocket and maneuvering is just minor adjustments extra mass isnt a huge deal for operation of the satellite  it certainly impacts launch cost which is presently millions of dollars so as launch costs come down satellite makers will likely spend less time and money on mass reduction but for spaceships mass will be very carefully budgeted for the foreseeable future","No-Philosopher3703","2025-02-13 00:39:48","1"

both are sodium channel blockers

just like the newest anesthetic which was fda approved early feb 2025 

ill make the hypothetical leap that this new anesthetic drug might affect brain cancer 

hopefully to kill it if theres a therapeutic window that doesnt kill normal tissue around it 

or help it form and adapt and become resistant if given too slowly

it will be interestingsad to see in 510 years whether people who get this new anesthetic have higher levels of brain cancer

probably no change

there is already relatively simple technology that removes a lot of mercury from entering the environment which are scrubbers on a coal or cement plant for example which are the biggest sources of hg  or it would also be better to enforce regulations controlling waste from paper manufacturing and chloro alkalyde plants which are big sources of hg stopping pollution from its source is much easier then coming in and cleaning up the mess later

more importantly the first bioconcentration is into algae and it is factors more potent than fish so if anything it would be better to allow more sea grass or other native plants to grow instead of introducing modified organisms also much more ethical than purposely poisoning living beings","alligatorislater","2025-02-15 09:21:42","1"

since the drug is experimental it will likely be outrageously expensive due to it having a monopoly on the market for 1020 years due to law its to help the company who spent a billion dollars investing in its manufacturing recoup their investment not saying it should be this way it should be affordable but it would discourage those companies to invest more in experimental drugs

more generally we are now able to observe the early stages of the disease process   before we couldnt do that with any confidence   this is a huge step toward figuring something out  if that something isnt already in development it will be at least twenty years before it is on the market but this is a real step toward that goal","GreenStrong","2025-02-15 17:10:56","1"

all jokes aside though theres probably good reason to be concerned that this isnt a foolproof idea anyways theres no technology at play in this story besides the ancient human past time of burying stuff we dont want around anymore aside from wind turbines being a form of technology and this idea being somewhat related to them 

the idea of building it into roads is just a way to make the fact we are just burying them sound prettier despite the fact that is what we do with all our garbage anyways not really anything super innovative here theres not even really anything notable technologywise to speak of this post arguably does belong in renergy or renvironment but its not really relevant in here shouldnt be anyways 

i doubt the way they are using it has any significant impact on the structure of the roads they put it in so it is likely the only way it saves any cost is that it saves room in the landfills no tech breakthrough there just a mildly clever policy approach to keeping decommissioning costs for wind energy down","nikolai_470000","2025-02-15 19:05:10","1"
